<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Gateway.aspx">Gateway</a> is a local
authority labour activation scheme that provides short-term work and training
opportunities for long-term unemployed people who have been on the Live
Register for over 2 years. The work opportunities are to benefit the local
area. Gateway is managed by city and county councils (collectively known as
local authorities) for the Department of Social Protection, which has overall
responsibility for the scheme.</p>

<p>Unemployed people who are eligible to participate in the scheme are selected
and contacted by the Department of Social Protection – see 'Selection
process' below.</p>

<h3>Type of project</h3>

<p>The work carried out by Gateway participants is mainly outdoor work but can
be in any area of local authority activity. The work can be either in new
projects or in projects that local authorities no longer have to resources to
continue. Types of project eligible for the scheme include:</p>
<ul><li>Village enhancement schemes</li>
  <li>Landscaping</li>
  <li>Tourism ambassadors</li>
  <li>Control of animals</li>
  <li>Libraries</li>
  <li>New projects - brown field site remediation</li>
</ul><h3>Allocation of places</h3>

<p>The places on the scheme are allocated to local authorities in urban and
rural areas. The allocation is based on the availability of suitable placements
in each local authority.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l510a8">Participants</h2>

<p>To be eligible to participate in the Gateway scheme you must:</p>
<ul><li>Have been continuously unemployed for at least 24 months and "signing on"
    on a full-time basis; and</li>
  <li>Have been receiving a jobseeker's payment (Jobseeker's Benefit or
    Jobseeker's Allowance) from the Department of Social Protection for at
    least 24 months; and</li>
  <li>Be currently receiving Jobseeker's Allowance.</li>
</ul><h3>Selection process</h3>

<p>Unemployed people who are eligible for the scheme will be identified and
contacted by their social welfare local office or Intreo centre and offered the
opportunity to participate in the scheme.</p>

<p>If they agree to participate in the Gateway scheme they will be referred to
their local authority where they will be recruited for a suitable placement
when it becomes available.</p>

<p>As there only limited places available on the scheme, not all eligible
unemployed people will be contacted.</p>

<h3>Other work</h3>

<p>Participants on Gateway can take up other part-time employment provided it
does not interfere with the work and times of their Gateway work placement. If
participants are offered full-time alternative work they may terminate their
Gateway contract.</p>

<h3>Refusal of work placement</h3>

<p>Under the National Employment Action Plan someone getting Jobseeker’s
Allowance (JA) is required to take up work opportunities such as the offer of a
Gateway work placement. If they refuse a work opportunity without good reason,
they may have their social welfare payment reduced or terminated. If, following
a refusal of a placement, someone’s payment is reduced or terminated they may
appeal this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office within 21 days.</p>

<h3>Working conditions</h3>

<p>Participants will work for 19 ½ hours a week and the placement lasts 22
months. They receive the same statutory annual leave and public holiday
entitlement as other employees.</p>

<p>When the placement finishes, they should sign on again with their local
social welfare office or Intreo centre. They cannot participate in the Gateway
scheme again for 3 years.</p>

<h3>Rates</h3>

<p>The minimum weekly payment for participants (based on 19.5 hours worked) is
€210.50 from January 2016.</p>

<p><strong>I</strong>f the actual Jobseeker’s Allowance (including
dependants) you were getting was €188 a week or less, then you will get the
minimum Gateway weekly rate of €210.50 (that is €188 plus €22.50). If
your actual weekly Jobseeker’s Allowance (including dependants) was €188.01
or more, then you will get the equivalent rate plus €22.50.</p>

<p><strong>Additional income:</strong> If you have any additional income, for
example, from part-time work, it will not affect your Gateway payment. However,
the rules on change of circumstances that apply to Jobseeker’s Allowance also
apply to the Gateway payment. In order to avoid any possible overpayments, if
there is any change in your circumstances, you should inform your local
authority and your local social welfare office and Intreo centre. One example
of a change in your circumstances would be if your dependant got a job. Their
income would be assessed as means and your Gateway payment might be reduced. It
cannot be reduced below the minimum rate of €210.50.</p>

<p>Participants will retain any extra benefits and their medical card provided
they are still eligible.</p>

<p><strong>Spouse or partner and Gateway:</strong></p>

<p>If you get a place on a Gateway scheme and your spouse or partner is
claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JA), Disability Allowance (DA) or Farm Assist
in their own right, they can claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult with their
JA, DA or Farm Assist. Your income from the Gateway scheme (as a single person)
is then assessed as insurable employment against their payment.</p>

<p>If you are on a Gateway scheme and your spouse or partner gets a place on a
Gateway scheme, you will each get a single rate of the Gateway payment together
with half of the Increases for a Qualified Child for any dependent children.</p>

<h3>Tax and PRSI</h3>

<p>The Gateway payment is taxable but the amount payable depends on individual
circumstances.</p>

<p>Class A PRSI contributions will be paid for all participants. Those earning
more than €352 a week will pay a PRSI contribution.</p>

<p>Participants on the Gateway scheme are exempt from the Universal Social
Charge.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lbaf79">Local authorities</h2>

<p>The work placements are identified and provided by local authorities. The
local authorities must provide good quality work opportunities that are of
benefit to the community. Each local authority provides a list of work
opportunities to the Department of Social Protection. The Department then
randomly selects a list of eligible candidates from the Live Register in each
region and sends it to the local authority. Generally the number of eligible
candidates selected by the Department is double the number of work placements
proposed by the local authority and they will then go through the local
authority’s recruitment process. If a candidate is selected for a Gateway
placement, they must undergo <a href="../../employment_rights_and_conditions/monitoring_and_surveillance_at_work/garda_clearance_for_employees.html">Garda
vetting</a> before they can start work.</p>

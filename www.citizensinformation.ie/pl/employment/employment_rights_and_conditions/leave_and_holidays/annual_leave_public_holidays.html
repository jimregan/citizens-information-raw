<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Your entitlement to annual leave or holidays from work is set out in
legislation and in your contract of employment. Legislation gives various
entitlements to leave from work. These include annual leave, <a shape="rect" href="public_holidays_in_ireland.html">public holidays</a>, <a shape="rect" href="maternity_leave.html">maternity leave</a>, <a shape="rect" href="adoptive_leave.html">adoptive leave</a>, <a shape="rect" href="carers_leave_from_employment.html">carer's leave</a>, <a shape="rect" href="parental_leave.html">parental leave</a> and other <a shape="rect" href="types_of_leave_from_work.html">types of leave from work</a>. It is also
important to note that the periods of leave provided for by legislation are the
minimum entitlements only, you and your employer may agree to additional
entitlements. </p>

<p>In the case of agency employees, the party who pays the wages (employment
agency or client company) is the employer for the purposes of the Act and is
responsible for providing the entitlement. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Taking annual leave</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/index.html">Organisation
of Working Time Act 1997</a> provides for a basic annual paid leave entitlement
of 4 weeks, although an employee's contract could give greater rights.</p>

<p>It is for your employer to decide when annual leave may be taken, but this
is subject to a number of conditions. Your employer must take into account your
family responsibilities, opportunities for rest and recreation that are
available to you and to consult with you (or your union) at least one month
before the leave is to be taken. In addition, annual leave should be taken
within the appropriate leave year or with your consent, within 6 months of the
relevant leave year. Further holding over (also known as carrying-over) of
annual leave at your wish is a matter for agreement between you and your
employer. </p>

<p><strong>Holiday pay:</strong> Pay in respect of annual leave is paid in
advance at the normal weekly rate. If your pay varies because, for example, of
commission or bonus payments, your pay for your holidays is the average of your
pay over the 13 weeks before you take holidays.</p>

<h3>Annual leave and sick leave</h3>

<p>If you are ill while you are on annual leave, you should get a medical
certificate from your family doctor (GP) as soon as possible to cover the days
that you were sick and give this to your employer as soon as you return to
work. In this way, the <em>sick days</em> will not count as annual leave and
will be available to you at a later date. An employer cannot require you to
take annual leave for a certified period of illness. </p>

<p>Since 1 August 2015, you <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/News-And-Events/Department-News/2015/August/04082015.html">accumulate
statutory annual leave entitlement during a period of certified sick leave</a>.
Employees on long-term <a href="sick_leave.html">sick leave</a> can retain
annual leave they could not take due to illness for up to 15 months after the
end of the year in which it is accrued. </p>

<h3>Annual leave and other leave</h3>

<p>Annual leave is not affected by other leave provided for by law. Time spent
on maternity leave, adoptive leave, parental leave, force majeure leave and the
first 13 weeks of carer's leave is treated as though you have been in
employment and this time can be used to accumulate annual leave entitlement -
see 'Calculating annual leave' below.</p>

<h3>Annual leave and leaving employment</h3>

<p>It is illegal under the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 for an
employer to pay an allowance in lieu of the minimum statutory holiday
entitlement of an employee unless the employment relationship is terminated. In
general, your annual leave is calculated on the basis of hours worked. </p>

<p>If you are leaving a job you are entitled to receive payment for any
outstanding annual leave and public holidays due to you. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l9e2f0">Calculating annual leave</h2>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/20/section/19/enacted/en/html#sec19">Section
19 (1)</a> of the Act you are entitled to a basic annual paid leave entitlement
of 4 weeks. There are 3 different ways of calculating your annual leave
entitlement: </p>
<ul><li>Based on the employee's working hours during what is called the <em>leave
    year</em>, which runs from April to March. An employee who has worked at
    least 1,365 hours in a leave year is entitled to the maximum of 4 working
    weeks' paid annual leave unless it is a leave year in which they change
    employment. Many employers use the calendar year (January-December) instead
    of the official leave year to calculate entitlement </li>
  <li>By allowing 1/3 of a working week for each calendar month in which the
    employee has worked at least 117 hours </li>
  <li>8% of the hours worked in the leave year, subject to a maximum of 4
    working weeks </li>
</ul><p>An employee may use whichever of these methods gives the greater
entitlement. When calculating the entitlement, employers should include all
hours worked including time spent on annual leave, maternity leave, parental
leave, force majeure leave, adoptive leave or the first 13 weeks of carer’s
leave.</p>

<p>An employee who has worked for at least 8 months is entitled to an unbroken
period of 2 weeks' annual leave.</p>

<p><strong>Part-time work:</strong> Generally, the annual leave for part-time
workers is calculated using the 3rd method, that is, 8% of hours worked. If you
work full time for some months and the rest of the year you work part time, you
should calculate the leave for the full-time and the part-time periods of work
separately.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You can find out more about annual leave in this <a href="http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Guide_to_the_OWT_Act_-_Holidays_Public_Holidays.pdf">explanatory
booklet on holidays and public holidays (pdf)</a> or from the Workplace
Relations Commission's <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Workplace_Relations_Services/Info_Cust_Serv/">Information
and Customer Service</a> - see 'Where to apply' below.</p>

<p>If you are not getting your holiday entitlement you may make a complaint
under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 within 6 months of the dispute
or complaint occurring. You must use the online complaint form available on <a href="http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Referring-a-Dispute/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.
The time limit may be extended for up to a further 6 months, but only where
there is a reasonable cause which prevented the complaint being brought within
the normal time limit. </p>

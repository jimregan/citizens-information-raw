<p>The Household Benefits Package is a package of allowances which help you
with the costs of running your household. The package is available to everyone
aged over 70 and to people under age 70 in certain circumstances.You must be
living permanently in the State - this means full-time and all year round. Only
one person in a household can qualify for the package at any time. You must
show that you are the registered consumer at the address for which you are
applying for the Household Benefits, for example, by providing a utility bill.
If you are renting your home, your landlord must provide written confirmation
that you are a tenant (including the <a href="http://www.seai.ie/Your_Business/Public_Sector/FAQ/Gathering_Data_MPRNs_GPRNs/What_is_an_MPRN.html">MPRN</a>
or <a href="http://www.seai.ie/Your_Business/Public_Sector/FAQ/Gathering_Data_MPRNs_GPRNs/What_is_a_GPRN.html">GPRN</a>
of the address you are living at) and confirm that you are paying your own
energy bills. </p>

<p>There are various commercial websites that allow you to compare energy
prices. The <a href="http://www.cer.ie/">Commission for Energy Regulation
(CER)</a> accredits cost comparison websites if they meet certain standards.
You can check <a href="http://www.cer.ie/customer-care/about-us/links#Accredited-Price-Comparison-Websites">accredited
websites on energycustomers.ie</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Information-for-customers-in-financial-difficulty-with-their-energy-bills.aspx">The
Department of Social Protection has published information on what to do if you
are in financial difficulty with your energy bills</a>.</p>

<h3>Keeping well and warm in winter</h3>

<p>Coping with cold weather can be difficult especially if you are older or
have a disability or a long-term illness. The website, <a href="http://www.seai.ie/WellandWarm/">wellandwarm.ie</a>, gives information
and advice about the supports available to help you and your household keep
well and warm during the winter. </p>

<p></p>

<h2>Allowances</h2>

<p>There are 2 allowances in the Household Benefits Package:</p>

<p><strong>Allowance 1</strong></p>
<ul><li>The Electricity Allowance <strong>or</strong></li>
  <li>Natural Gas Allowance <strong>or</strong></li>
  <li>Cash Electricity Allowance <strong>or</strong></li>
  <li>Cash Gas Allowance </li>
</ul><p><strong>Allowance 2</strong></p>
<ul><li>The Free Television Licence </li>
</ul><p><strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>The Telephone Allowance was discontinued from 1 January
2014.</strong></p>

<p></p>

<h3>Allowance 1: Electricity/Gas Allowance</h3>

<p>If you have an electricity or natural gas supply, you can only choose either
the Electricity Allowance or the Natural Gas Allowance. </p>

<h3>Electricity Allowance</h3>

<p>The Electricity Allowance is paid either as a cash payment directly to you
or a cash credit paid against your electricity/ or gas bill to you each month.
(This only applies to Bord Gais and Electric Ireland only customers.). </p>

<h4>Electric Ireland customers</h4>

<p>Following approval of your application for an Electricity Allowance, the
Department notifies Electric Ireland, who will apply the allowance, including
any backdated credit, on your next or subsequent bill. The allowance is paid
directly to Electric Ireland. You must pay in the normal way for any
electricity you use above the allowance.</p>

<h4>Other electricity providers</h4>

<p>If your electricity provider is <strong>not</strong> Electric Ireland, your
Electricity Allowance is paid directly to you to use towards your electricity
bill. In this case, the allowance can be paid into your bank account or at your
local post office. If you are using a prepaid supplier you will also get a cash
payment. </p>

<p>If you change electricity supplier, it is your responsibility to notify the
Department of this change. You must provide proof of your new energy provider
(utility bill in your name) from the change date. </p>

<h3>Cash Electricity Allowance (paid to people living in self-contained
accommodation)</h3>

<p>You may qualify for a monthly Cash Electricity Allowance of €35 (equal to
€1.15 per day) if you are living in self-contained accommodation (a flat or
apartment), and:</p>
<ul><li>You have your own electricity slot meter 
    <p>or</p>
  </li>
  <li>There are a number of separate electricity meters operating from one
    meter from an electricity provider and the registered consumer of
    electricity is a landlord 
    <p>or</p>
  </li>
  <li>There are no separate meters, but the registered consumer of electricity
    at your address is a landlord.</li>
</ul><p>Your landlord must provide written confirmation (including the <a href="http://www.seai.ie/Your_Business/Public_Sector/FAQ/Gathering_Data_MPRNs_GPRNs/What_is_an_MPRN.html">MPRN</a>
or <a href="http://www.seai.ie/Your_Business/Public_Sector/FAQ/Gathering_Data_MPRNs_GPRNs/What_is_a_GPRN.html">GPRN</a>
of the address you are living at) that you are a tenant and are paying your own
energy bills. </p>

<p>If you change electricity supplier, it is your responsibility to notify the
Department of this change. You must provide proof of your new energy provider
(utility bill in your name) from the change date.</p>

<p>The Cash Electricity Allowance is paid on the first Tuesday of each month to
an account in a financial institution, for example, a bank or, if you have a
social welfare services card, through your local post office. (Note that if you
are being paid through a post office, using a social welfare services card, you
have 90 days to collect your payment.)</p>

<h3>Natural Gas Allowance</h3>

<p>Depending on your supplier the Natural Gas Allowance of €35 (equal to
€1.15 per day) can be paid as a cash credit on your gas bill or on the first
Tuesday of each month to an account in a financial institution or a post
office. </p>

<p>The Allowance does not cover the cost of installing a natural gas supply to
your home.</p>

<p>If the Allowance is paid as a credit on your gas bill, the Department
notifies your gas provider, who will apply the allowance, including any
backdated credit, on your second gas bill after that date.</p>

<p>You must satisfy some conditions to qualify for the Natural Gas Allowance.
You must show proof that you are the registered consumer on the energy bills
(MPRN/GPRN). If you are renting and the utility bill is in the landlord’s
name, your landlord must provide written confirmation (including the <a href="http://www.seai.ie/Your_Business/Public_Sector/FAQ/Gathering_Data_MPRNs_GPRNs/What_is_an_MPRN.html">MPRN</a>
or <a href="http://www.seai.ie/Your_Business/Public_Sector/FAQ/Gathering_Data_MPRNs_GPRNs/What_is_a_GPRN.html">GPRN</a>
of the address you are living at) that you are a tenant and are paying your own
energy bills.</p>

<h4>If you change energy supplier</h4>

<p>It is very important to note that if you change energy supplier, it is your
responsibility to notify the Department of this change. You must provide proof
of your new provider (utility bill in your name) from the change date.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Cash Gas Allowance</h3>

<p>If your home is not connected to an electricity or natural gas supply but
you satisfy the conditions of the scheme, you can get the Cash Gas Allowance of
€35 (equal to €1.15 per day).</p>

<p>You can also claim a Cash Gas Allowance if you use gas which is not
delivered through the national grid. For example, in some areas a gas tank may
provide gas to a number of individually-metered households. The Cash Gas
Allowance is paid on the first Tuesday of each month to an account in a
financial institution or a post office. </p>

<h3>Carry forward of gas or electricity units</h3>

<p>Your monthly allowance of €35 (equal to €1.15 per day) can be carried
forward without restriction and can be drawn down at any stage, including if
you wish to switch to a different energy provider.</p>

<h3>Allowance 2: Free Television Licence</h3>

<p>Once you qualify for the Household Benefits Package, you become eligible for
a Free Television Licence from the next renewal date of your television
licence. You must select the Television Licence option on the form when you
applyfor the Household Benefits package.</p>

<p>When you qualify for the Household Benefits Package and have been awarded a
Free Television Licence, the Department issues you with a TV licence, and also
notifies An Post of your entitlement to a free licence for as long as you are
entitled to the Household Benefits Package.</p>

<h3>Concession for people transferring from Invalidity Pension, Disability
Allowance or Blind Pension</h3>

<p>If you are receiving Invalidity Pension, Disability Allowance or Blind
Pension and you are receiving any Household Benefit allowance you may keep it
if you transfer to another primary payment from the Department of Social
Protection. This does not apply if you transfer to Jobseeker's
Benefit/Allowance, Illness Benefit, One-Parent Family Payment and Carer's
Benefit or if your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant claims for you as a
qualified adult on their payment.</p>

<p>Note that in general if you transfer from any primary payment to become a
qualified adult on your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant’s payment you
lose your entitlement to the Household Benefits Package (it will be paid to
your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant if they qualify).</p>

<p></p>

<h3>The means test</h3>

<p>If you are aged between 66 and 70 and <strong>are</strong> <strong>not
receiving a qualifying payment</strong>, you must satisfy a means test.</p>

<p>The means test involves calculating your appropriate weekly means limit.
This limit is based on the current maximum rate of State Pension (Contributory)
including increases for age, living alone, and adult/child dependants.</p>

<p>Your weekly income limit consists of the maximum rate of State Pension
(Contributory) plus €100. Your weekly income limit is then compared to your
weekly means as assessed in a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Publications/SW107/Pages/Appendix1.aspx">means
test</a>. </p>

<p>If your weekly means are less than or equal to your weekly income limit, you
satisfy the means test and qualify for the Household Benefits Package. </p>

<p>If you are applying for the Household Benefits Package on the basis of the
means test, a separate means test questionnaire will be posted to you for
completion. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Change of circumstances</h3>

<p>You must notify the Department if:</p>
<ul><li>You change address</li>
  <li>You change energy provider</li>
  <li>You are under 70 years of age and your household composition changes</li>
  <li>You move into residential care</li>
</ul><p>If you change address and you still satisfy the conditions for the Household
Benefits Package, you must re-apply for the package.</p>

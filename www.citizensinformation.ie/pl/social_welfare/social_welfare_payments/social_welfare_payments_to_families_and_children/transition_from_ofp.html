<p>On 2 July 2015 the age limit for the <a href="one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent Family Payment</a> (OFP)
reduced to 7 years for most claimants. This means that a large number of people
no longer qualify for OFP from July 2015 because their youngest child is over
the age limit.There are exemptions to the age limit for people parenting alone
who are getting a Domiciliary Care Allowance or Blind Pension, who are caring
or who have been recently bereaved.</p>

<p>This document gives an overview of the options open to you. You can also get
more information and advice at <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/List-of-Social-Welfare-Local-and-Branch-Offices-by-County.aspx">your
Intreo centre or social welfare local office</a> or your nearest <a href="http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/">Citizens Information
Centre</a>.</p>

<p>Note that up to now the age limits for OFP varied depending on when you
started to get the payment. However this no longer applies from 2 July 2015
since the age limit will be 7 years for everyone from that date.</p>

<h3>Information seminars</h3>

<p>The Department of Social Protection (DSP) invited people who were affected
by the changes to One-Parent Family Payment to attend information seminars. If,
for some reason, you have not attended an information seminar you should
contact your Intreo centre or social welfare local office as soon as possible
to discuss the options available to you.</p>

<p>You can also contact your <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/List-of-Social-Welfare-Local-and-Branch-Offices-by-County.aspx">Intreo
centre or social welfare local office</a> with any questions you have about the
ending of your One-Parent Family Payment and your eligibility for the
Jobseeker’s Transitional payment.</p>

<h3>Jobseeker’s Transitional payment</h3>

<p>Most people who no longer qualify for a One-Parent Family Payment because
their youngest child is aged 7 will transfer to the Jobseeker’s Transitional
payment (called JST).</p>

<p>JST is paid to people who are not cohabiting and whose youngest child is
aged between 7 and 13. It aims to support you into the workforce while also
acknowledging that you are caring for young children. You can take part in a
course of education and get JST. You can get more information in our document
on the <a href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance_transition.html">Jobseeker’s
Transitional payment</a>. </p>

<h3>OFP and Family Income Supplement</h3>

<p>If you are working and getting <a href="family_income_supplement.html">Family Income Supplement (FIS)</a> in
addition to OFP, your FIS payment will be automatically reviewed when your OFP
ends. In most cases this will lead to an increase in your FIS payment.</p>

<p>You may also qualify for the new <a href="back_to_work_family_dividend.html">Back to Work Family Dividend
(BTWFD)</a>. This new payment allows parents getting One-Parent Family Payment
or a jobseeker’s payment to keep the full Increase for a Qualified Child
(€29.80 per week per child) for the first year of employment or
self-employment and half that amount in the second year. BTWFD can be paid as
well as FIS and it will have no impact on your entitlement to FIS.</p>

<p>If you are currently on OFP and FIS and your OFP is ending in July 2015, you
will be sent an application form for BTWFD with the letter explaining the
changes to your OFP payment. </p>

<p>If you have a general question about FIS you can call the FIS section at
(043) 334 0053 or e-mail <a href="mailto:FISSection@welfare.ie">FISSection@welfare.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>OFP and Carer’s Allowance</h3>

<p>People parenting alone, who care for one of their children or for an adult
(such as a parent or a sibling) can now qualify for both OFP and <a href="../carers/half_rate_carers_allowance.html">half-rate Carer’s
Allowance</a>, provided that their youngest child is aged under 16 years. (An
amendment to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005, was enacted to allow
for this change.) </p>

<p>This means that you can claim OFP and a half-rate Carer’s Allowance (CA)
until your youngest child turns 16 provided you continue to meet the conditions
for both schemes. You will also get an Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC) for
any other children in the family until they reach 18 (or 22 if in full-time
education) while CA and OFP is in payment.</p>

<p>If you were previously getting both OFP and half-rate CA, and were affected
by the OFP age change reforms, you are now eligible to re-apply for both
payments.</p>

<p>This provision also covers new entrants to the OFP scheme, whose youngest
child is aged between 7 and 15 years inclusive, when they qualify for Carer's
Allowance. </p>

<h3>OFP and Domiciliary Care Allowance</h3>

<p>If you are getting <a href="../disability_and_illness/domiciliary_care_allowance.html">Domiciliary
Care Allowance (DCA)</a> for one of your children, the age limit of 7 for the
youngest child does not apply, and you can retain your OFP payment. This means
that you can continue to qualify for OFP until that child is aged 16 or your
DCA stops. You will also get an Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC) for any
other children in the family until they reach 18 (or 22 if in full-time
education) while DCA and OFP is in payment. If your youngest child is under 7
years of age when your DCA stops you may also continue to qualify for OFP. </p>

<h3>OFP and return to education</h3>

<p>If you are taking part in a recognised education course when your
entitlement to OFP ends you can finish your course and get a payment. The
payment you qualify for depends on your circumstances. </p>

<p>If you are currently taking part in a full-time course of education and your
OFP claim is ending on 2 July 2015 you can stay on OFP until you finish your
course. You can continue to claim a <a href="../../../education/third_level_education/fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/maintenance_grant_schemes_for_students_on_third_level_courses.html">maintenance
grant</a> and this grant will not be assessed as means against your OFP.
<strong>This arrangement is only for people whose OFP claim ended on
</strong><strong>2 July 2015</strong>.</p>

<p>A separate arrangement will be in place after 2 July 2015. If you are in
education and your OFP ends because your youngest child has reached the age
limit you can move to the Jobseeker’s Transitional payment (JST) and continue
your course. You can claim JST and a maintenance grant at the same time and the
grant will not be assessed as means for JST. However you should note that you
cannot claim Rent Supplement if you are getting a maintenance grant or if you
are in full-time education. </p>

<p>It is important to remember that your entitlement to JST will end when your
youngest child reaches the age of 14. If you have not finished your course when
your youngest child reaches the age of 14 you will have to either transfer to
the <a href="../back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">Back to
Education Allowance</a> to complete your course or opt to remain in receipt of
your student grant. </p>

<p>If you are currently on a <a href="../../../education/vocational_education_and_training/fas_training_courses.html">FET
training course</a> and OFP, arrangements will be made with the Department of
Education and Skills to take over your payment.</p>

<p>If you are currently on a <a href="../../../education/returning_to_education/vocational_training_opportunities_scheme.html">VTOS
education programme</a> and OFP, you can contact your ETB course co-ordinator
for a training allowance to be paid to you.</p>

<h3>OFP and employment schemes</h3>

<p>If you are on an <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/schemes_to_support_employment.html">employment
scheme</a> (such as Community Employment) when your entitlement to OFP ends you
can continue on the scheme until it finishes and get a payment. DSP staff will
arrange this for you. </p>

<h3>OFP and Blind Pension</h3>

<p><a href="../disability_and_illness/blind_persons_pension.html">Blind
Pension</a> is payable with OFP. This means that a person who qualifies for OFP
and Blind Pension can get both payments at the full rate. People who qualify
for Blind Pension will be exempted from the age conditions for OFP. This means
that you can claim both Blind Pension and OFP (and any IQCs payable with both
Blind Pension and OFP) together until your youngest child is 16 years of age.
This provision is in effect from May 2015.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Department of Social Protection (DSP) provides employment support and
advice to jobseekers nationwide.</p>

<p>Jobseekers include people who are getting a jobseeker’s payment, people
who are signing for credits and people who are unemployed but not eligible for
a payment. However priority is generally given to people getting a
jobseeker’s payment.</p>

<p>Many DSP social welfare local offices and employment services offices are
now Intreo centres.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Intreo.aspx">Intreo</a> provides a
one-stop shop for employment services and income supports with a range of
personalised supports to jobseekers. In your local Intreo centre you can get
jobseeking advice, information on job vacancies and income support (your weekly
payment) all in one place. <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Intreo---Contact-Information.aspx">Details
of locations are published on welfare.ie</a>.</p>

<p>Find out what happens when <a href="signing_on.html">you sign on for a
jobseeker’s payment</a> at an Intreo centre.</p>

<p>Employment services are an integrated part of the Intreo service but in some
locations the Intreo service is not fully operational. If you do not have a
local Intreo centre you can make a claim for a jobseeker's payment at your <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/List-of-Social-Welfare-Local-and-Branch-Offices-by-County.aspx">local
social welfare office</a> and you can register for employment services at your
<a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Employment-Services-Offices.aspx">local
employment services office</a> or <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Local-Employment-Service-Locations.aspx">Local
Employment Service (LES) office (which operate in 24 disadvantaged
areas).</a></p>

<table border="1" style="width: 100%"><caption></caption>
  <col><tbody><tr><td><strong>What is activation?</strong> 

        <p>Labour market activation policies are designed to give jobseekers a
        better chance of finding employment. The Department of Social
        Protection describes activation as its engagement with jobseekers to
        support them back into employment. Jobseekers are expected to fully
        engage with this process and use the supports offered during the
        activation process which might include education or training schemes,
        employment support schemes to help them back into the workplace,
        internships and other supports.</p>

        <p>People aged under 62 who do not engage with the activation process
        may have their payment reduced and can subsequently be disqualified
        from their payment for up to 9 weeks. <a href="older_jobseekers.html">Jobseekers aged over 62 do not have to
        engage with the activation process</a>.</p>

<h2>JobPath</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/JobPath.aspx">JobPath is a new
employment activation programme</a> that is intended to help jobseekers find
and retain full-time employment. The Department of Social Protection selects
clients for JobPath on a random basis. You cannot apply to go on JobPath.
Supports from JobPath are aimed at people who are long-term unemployed and
people who are newly unemployed but who may need intensive support to find
work.</p>

<p>If you are selected for JobPath you will be referred to a JobPath company.
There are two companies - <a href="http://www.seetec.ie/">Seetec</a> and <a href="http://www.turasnua.ie/">Turas Nua</a>. You will be assigned to a
personal adviser who will assess your skills, work experience and work goals.
The adviser will draw up a Personal Progression Plan with you which will
include a series of activities and actions designed to help you get a job.
These might include work experience, training and other relevant supports. You
will be given career advice and helped with CV and interview preparation. You
can also get support and advice about starting your own business.</p>

<p>You keep your jobseeker's payment while on JobPath. Generally the programme
lasts for a year (52 weeks). If you find a job the Jobpath company will
continue to work with you while you are in employment for up to a year. It will
give particular support during the first few weeks of employment.</p>

<p>If you are registered with Jobpath you are not eligible for <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/schemes_to_support_employment.html">DSP
employment support schemes</a> (such as Tús or Community Employment).</p>

<p>Depending on local arrangements, while you are on JobPath you may sign on
for your jobseeker's payment less often than at present, or in some situations
you may not have to sign on at all.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l46d2c">Services available to jobseekers</h2>

<p>Employment services are available to all EEA nationals. If you are from
outside the EEA you should contact your local Intreo centre or social welfare
office to check your eligibility. You need a <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">Personal
Public Services (PPS) number</a> to register for employment services. In some
cases you will be directed to these supports through the Department’s
activation process. If you are not claiming a payment or are not engaged in
activation (for example, if you are over 62) you can also access some of these
supports directly, although in some cases priority may be given to people
getting a jobseeker’s payment. The services and supports include:</p>

<p></p><ul><li>A <strong>group engagement session</strong> with other jobseekers to give
    you an overview of the supports available. You are assigned to a group
    engagement session when you first sign on for a jobseeker’s payment.</li>
  <li>Depending on your jobseeker profile <strong>one-to-one sessions</strong>
    with a DSP case officer to discuss employment opportunities, training
    courses, financial supports and other options which may lead to employment.
    If you are getting a jobseeker’s payment you will be given on-going
    appointments to monitor your progression towards employment, training or
    education.</li>
</ul><ul><li>A <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Jobseeker-Pack.aspx">Jobseeker
    Information booklet</a> that gives practical advice on CVs, job application
    letters, interviews, recruitment channels and summarises the employment and
    training supports that may help you in your job search.</li>
  <li><strong>Self-service kiosks</strong> (available in Intreo centres and
    employment services offices) where you can find and print information on
    jobs and training opportunities.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.jobsireland.ie/">Jobs Ireland website</a> which
    lists jobs available in Ireland and abroad. It also lists internships and
    employment programme vacancies. You can input your CV to the Jobs Ireland
    database using the website. Employers can access these CVs through this
    database and contact a jobseeker directly. You can also access the Jobs
    Ireland website via <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Jobseeker-App.aspx">smart phone
    app</a>, by calling 1800 611 116 and via the self-service kiosks located in
    an Intreo centre or local social welfare office.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Jobs-Clubs.aspx">Job Clubs</a>
    which provide supports for jobseekers including a ‘drop in’ service and
    formal workshops.</li>

    Benefit of Work Ready Reckoner</a> which can help you assess out the
    financial consequences of taking up full-time work. The Reckoner works out
    the total amount you would receive on taking up full-time work (including
    any Family Income Supplement) and compares this to what you are getting in
    jobseeker payments (including Rent Supplement).</li>
  <li>A <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Training-Support-Grant.aspx">Training
    Support Grant (TSG)</a> is available to jobseekers and people getting
    certain other payments. The TSG provides quick access to short-term
    training that is not immediately available from a State provider or that
    will help you get a job quickly. Your case officer can approve a grant
    under this scheme if it meets your identified needs (for example, as set
    out in your Personal Progression Plan) and is not available from another
    State provider. </li>

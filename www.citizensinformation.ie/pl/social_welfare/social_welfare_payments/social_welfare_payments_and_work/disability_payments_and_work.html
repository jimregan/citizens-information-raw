<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are getting certain disability payments you may be allowed to do work
or training that is considered rehabilitative or therapeutic. People getting
Illness Benefit and Invalidity Benefit cannot work (except for unpaid voluntary
work). They must transfer to the Partial Capacity Scheme if they wish to work.
</p>

<p>In most cases you need permission to take up rehabilitative work or
training. This permission is sometimes called an <em>exemption</em>. Exemptions
(for both work or training courses) are always granted for a specific period of
time. At the end of that period you must re-apply. </p>

<p>In general, if you are getting a means-tested payment your income from work
will be assessed in the means test. However some of your income from work is
not assessed. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lc77a7">Employment and disability payments</h2>

<p><strong>Social assistance (means-tested) payments</strong>: <a shape="rect" href="../disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability
Allowance</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../disability_and_illness/blind_persons_pension.html">Blind Pension</a>
are means-tested disability payments. If you wish to do rehabilitative
employment you must get written approval from the Department of Social
Protection (DSP) to retain your Disability Allowance or Blind Pension. For both
payments you need to provide a letter from your doctor certifying that the
proposed work is rehabilitative. You also need to provide confirmation of your
earnings (a payslip, your contract of employment or a letter from your
employer). You do not need to have been getting your payment for a minimum
period of time before you can apply for a rehabilitative work exemption.</p>

<p>To qualify for a means-tested payment your income from various sources is
examined to see whether it is under a certain level. Some earnings from
rehabilitative work are not taken into account in the assessment of your means
and do not affect your payment. For Disability Allowance and Blind Pension,
earnings of up to €120 from rehabilitative work (either as an employee or as
a self-employed person) are not taken into account at all in the assessment of
means. (The means assessed are your gross earnings less PRSI, any pension
contributions and any union dues. You cannot deduct income tax or income
levies.)</p>

<p>If you earn more than €120 per week from rehabilitative work, 50% of your
earnings between €120 and €350 are not taken into account in the Disability
Allowance or Blind Pension means test. </p>

<p><strong>Disability Allowance:</strong> all earnings over €350 are assessed
as income and your entitlement to Disability Allowance will be reduced in line
with the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/1084_Illness-disability-and-caring.aspx">appropriate
reduced rates of payment for Disability Allowance</a>. If you have no other
means, the maximum amount you can earn is €422.50 and still keep an
entitlement to the minimum personal payment of €3 (2016). If you are getting
payments for a qualified adult or qualified children your means from
rehabilitative work are deducted from the family rate that applies to you. </p>

<p><strong>Blind Pension:</strong> all earnings over €350 will also be
assessed as income and your entitlement to Blind Pension will be reduced in
line with the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/1084_Illness-disability-and-caring.aspx">appropriate
reduced rates of payment for Blind Pension.</a> If you have no other means, the
maximum amount you can earn is €427.60 and still keep an entitlement to the
minimum personal payment of €3 (2016).</p>

<p>While no restriction has been placed on the number of hours you may work you
should use a maximum of 20 hours a week as a guideline.</p>

<p><strong>Social insurance payments: </strong><a shape="rect" href="../disability_and_illness/invalidity_pension.html">Invalidity Pension</a>
and <a shape="rect" href="../disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">Illness Benefit</a>
are social insurance (PRSI-based) payments. You cannot work while you are
getting these payments (with the exception of <a href="../voluntary_work_and_social_welfare_payments.html">voluntary unpaid
work</a>). </p>

<p>If you have been getting Invalidity Pension or Illness Benefit (for at least
6 months) you can apply for <a href="../disability_and_illness/partial_capacity_benefit.html">Partial
Capacity Benefit</a>. if you have a reduced capacity to work. The work does not
have to be considered rehabilitative. You may have to pay <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">income
tax</a> on your total income. Exemptions for rehabilitative work are no longer
available except for FET training courses (see 'FET training courses'
below).</p>

<h3>Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme and rehabilitative work</h3>

<p><strong>Injury Benefit</strong> is one of the benefits available under the
<a href="../disability_and_illness/occupational_injuries_benefit_overview.html">Occupational
Injuries Scheme</a>. If you are getting Injury Benefit you can do light
voluntary work. You can also do part-time work which is part of a treatment or
charitable in character (provided you do not earn more than €50 a week)
without permission. However if you wish to do other rehabilitative work or a
training course you must get written permission from the DSP (called an
exemption) before starting. Exemptions allowing a person to work are not
normally granted within the first 26 weeks of Injury Benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Incapacity Supplement</strong> is paid to people who are getting
Disablement Benefit and who do not qualify for any other disability payments.
You can work provided you do not earn more than €33 a week. However if you
wish to do other rehabilitative work or a training course you must get written
permission from the DSP before starting. Requests for an exemption to do
training courses are automatically granted but subsequent requests are referred
to a DSP medical advisor. If you wish to take part in a Community Employment
Scheme you cannot retain your Incapacity Supplement but you can retain your
Disablement Benefit.</p>

<p>People getting Disablement Benefit (without another payment) can work (full-
or part-time) and do not need permission from the Department.</p>

<h3>Employment schemes and other payments</h3>

<p>People getting Disability Allowance can qualify for <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/national_internship_scheme.html">JobBridge</a>
– the National Internship Scheme and the <a href="../farming_and_fishing/rural_social_scheme.html">Rural Social
Scheme</a> (if they are actively farming or fishing). </p>

<p>People getting Illness Benefit, Invalidity Pension, Disability Allowance,
and Blind Pension can qualify for the <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/fas_work_placement_programme.html">Work
Placement Programme</a> and <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/community_employment_scheme.html">Community
Employment</a>.</p>

<p>People getting disability payments are not eligible for the <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/tus.html">TÚS</a>
or <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/gateway_scheme.html">Gateway</a>
schemes.</p>

<p>People getting Disability Allowance and Blind Pension can qualify for <a href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
Income Supplement (FIS)</a> if they meet the criteria. People getting
Invalidity Pension and Illness Benefit cannot work and therefore cannot qualify
for FIS. People getting Partial Capacity Benefit do not qualify for FIS. </p>

<h3>Extra benefits</h3>

<p>If you work while getting Disability Allowance or Blind Pension you can
retain any <a href="../extra_social_welfare_benefits/additional_social_welfare_benefits.html">extra
benefits</a> you were getting. However the amount of Rent Supplement you get
may be affected by your increased income. </p>

<p>In general you can retain any extra benefits you were getting when you take
part in an employment scheme. </p>

<p>You can read about Rent Supplement and how additional income from work or
taking part in an employment scheme may affect it in our document on <a href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/changes_to_rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement and changes to your circumstances</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lb82b4">FET training courses</h2>

<p>If you are getting Disability Allowance or Blind Pension and take up a place
on a <a href="../../../education/vocational_education_and_training/fas_training_allowances.html">FET
training course</a> you receive <a href="../../../education/vocational_education_and_training/fas_training_allowances.html">a
training allowance</a> at the same rate as your social welfare payment. Your
social welfare payment is suspended when you are on the training course. You
can return to your social welfare payment when you leave the training
course.</p>

<p>If you were getting Invalidity Pension or Illness Benefit, and take up a
place on a FET training course you will continue to get your full social
welfare payment including any increases you get for your dependents. You do not
get a training allowance or a training bonus. You must always apply for prior
written permission from DSP before you can take up a training course.</p>

<p>You can read more in our document on <a href="../../../education/vocational_education_and_training/fas_training_allowances.html">training
allowances</a>.</p>

<p>You retain any <a href="../extra_social_welfare_benefits/additional_social_welfare_benefits.html">extra
benefits</a> that you had before taking up the course. You can read about how
taking part in a training course may affect your Rent Supplement in our
document on <a href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/changes_to_rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement and changes to your circumstances</a>.</p>

<p>The Public Services Card was introduced in 2012 to make it easier to access
public services. </p>

<p>The card is replacing the Social Services Card used to collect social
welfare payments and the Free Travel Pass. The card was initially rolled out to
people getting certain social welfare payments and to new applicants for other
social welfare payments. If you apply for, or are currently getting a social
welfare payment (including Child Benefit) you may receive an invitation to
register for your Public Services Card. A Public Services Card is usually
issued when you are allocated a <a href="personal_public_service_number.html">PPS number</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.dfa.ie/passports-citizenship/top-passport-questions/new-requirements-for-first-time-adult-applicants/">The
Passport Service of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</a> has
announced that from 29 March 2016, all first-time passport applicants aged 18
and above who are resident in Ireland will need to have a Public Services Card
for identification purposes. This new requirement also applies to a small
number of adult passport applicants whose last passport was issued before 1
January 2005 and has since been reported lost, stolen or damaged.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Public Services Card is issued in one of 2 ways:</p>
<ul><li>Face-to-face registration – see ‘Registering for a Public Services
    Card’ below</li>
  <li>Postal registration see ‘Postal registration’ below </li>
</ul><h3>What information does this card display?</h3>

<p>The front of the card holds a person’s name, photograph and signature,
along with the card expiry date. The back of the card holds the person’s PPS
number and a card number. It also holds a magnetic stripe to enable social
welfare payments such as pensions to be collected at post offices</p>

<p>If the person holding the card is entitled to <a href="../social_welfare_payments/extra_social_welfare_benefits/free_travel.html">free
travel</a> the card will also display this information in the top left-hand
corner. If FT-P is written on the card the holder is personally entitled to
free travel. If FT+S is written on the card the holder can travel with their
spouse, partner or cohabitant. If FT+C is written on the card the holder can
have a companion (over 16) travel with them for free (because they are unable
to travel alone for medical reasons).</p>

<h2>Registering for a Public Services Card</h2>

<p>Face-to-face registration for a Public Services Card is called SAFE
(Standard Authentication Framework Environment) registration.</p>

<p>The Department of Social Protection will send you a letter with your SAFE
registration appointment. SAFE registration takes about 15 minutes to complete
and usually takes place in your <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/SAFE-Registration-PSC-Location.aspx">local
social welfare office or Intreo centre</a>. It is important that you attend for
your appointment. It will help to avoid any potential difficulty with access to
social welfare payments in the future. During this appointment your photograph
will be taken and your signature recorded for your new Public Services Card,
which will be posted to your home address. You will also be asked for the
answers to some security questions.</p>

<p>You must bring certain documents with you to your appointment to prove your
identity and address. You should also bring the letter you got confirming your
appointment and, if you have one, your phone. If you currently have a Social
Services Card (a swipe card used to collect social welfare payments), bring
that with you too.</p>

<p>You must prove your identify to receive a social welfare payment or benefit.
If you comply with the SAFE registration process when requested you are
considered to have authenticated your identity. If you do not comply with the
SAFE registration process your social welfare payments (including Child
Benefit) and/or your social welfare entitlements (such as Free Travel) may be
suspended.</p>

<h3>Documents to bring to your SAFE registration appointment</h3>

<p><strong>1.Evidence of identity: </strong></p>

<table border="1"><caption></caption>
  <col><col><tbody><tr><td>Irish citizens born in the Republic of Ireland</td>
      <td>Current Irish passport or current Irish or UK driving licence or
        Irish learner driver permit. If you are adopted, please bring your
        adoption certificate with you.</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Irish citizens via naturalisation or Foreign Birth Registration</td>
      <td>Current Irish passport or Certificate of Naturalisation or Foreign
        Birth Registration certificate and Irish or UK driving licence or Irish
        learner driver permit. 

        <p></p>
      </td>
    </tr><tr><td>Irish citizens born in Northern Ireland and UK citizens</td>
      <td>Current passport, or your birth or adoption certificate and current
        driving licence</td>
    </tr><tr><td>EU citizens (other than Irish and UK)</td>
      <td>Current passport or national identity card</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Non-EU citizens</td>
      <td>Current passport or 1951 travel document</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>For Irish citizens born in the Republic of Ireland, birth details can be
verified online in most cases with the General Register Office. However, in
some cases, it is not possible to locate the birth registration, so the person
will need to return with a copy of his/her birth certificate. </p>

<p>If you wish to get a copy of your Irish birth certificate for SAFE
registration purposes, you can get it from the <a href="../../birth_family_relationships/registrar_birth_marr_death.html">Registrar</a>
at a reduced rate when you show your SAFE invitation letter.</p>

<p>The Department does not have access to the adoption register, so adopted
people should bring their adoption certificate with them when attending their
appointment. </p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>2. Evidence of address (applies to everyone, whether an Irish, EU or
non-EU citizen): </strong></p>

<p>You need to show evidence of your address. You can use any of the following
documents to do this (it must show your name and address):</p>
<ul><li>A household utility bill</li>
  <li>An official letter/document</li>
  <li>A financial statement</li>
  <li>Property lease or tenancy agreement,</li>
  <li>Verifiable employer's letter*</li>
  <li>Confirmation of address by a third party such as a school
    principal/administrator, accommodation/property owner**or manager.</li>
</ul><p>*Your employer does not need to own or provide the accommodation. </p>

<p>**If you are staying with friends or relatives an original household bill
plus a note from the bill holder confirming your residency at the bill address
is acceptable. This note can be written on the bill itself.</p>

<p><strong>3. Additional helpful documents</strong></p>

<p>If you have any of the items listed below, you should bring them along with
you as they may also help to confirm your identity. If you do not have any of
these, you should bring other documents or forms of photo ID instead*.</p>
<ul><li>Irish Free Travel Pass</li>
  <li>Medical card issued under the General Medical Service</li>
  <li>European health insurance card</li>
  <li>Credit/debit card</li>
  <li>Student card</li>
</ul><p>*The following items are not acceptable as proof of identity for the purpose
of SAFE registration: Baptismal certificate, work ID card, Garda form ML-10,
Garda age card, photocopied certificates or documents and expired documents
generally. </p>

<h2>Postal registration</h2>

<p>Some current Department of Social Protection (DSP) clients can be issued
with a Public Services Card by postal registration. If this applies to you the
DSP may write to you asking your permission to use data that is already held by
a government department (such as your passport photograph or Free Travel Pass
photograph). If you give your consent to this data being used your Public
Services Card can be issued directly by post and you do not need to visit an
office to register in person. The letter will also ask you for answers to some
security questions. These answers will be used to check your identity if you
need to contact a DSP helpline.</p>

<h3>Lost or damaged Public Services Cards</h3>

<p>If your Public Services Card is lost, stolen or damaged, you should
immediately contact the Public Services Card Helpdesk at 1890 837000.</p>

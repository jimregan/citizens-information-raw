<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you think you have been wrongly refused a social welfare payment you can
appeal this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. You can also appeal
if you are unhappy about any decision of a social welfare Deciding Officer or
Designated Person (in the case of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme).
You must appeal within <strong>21 days</strong> of the notification of the
decision on your claim. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.socialwelfareappeals.ie/">Social Welfare Appeals
Office (SWAO)</a> operates independently of the Department of Social
Protection. It aims to provide an independent, accessible and fair appeals
service with regard to entitlement to social welfare payments and to deliver
that service in a prompt and courteous manner. The Office is headed by a Chief
Appeals Officer and has its own Appeals Officers who make decisions on
appeals.</p>

<p>You can get a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.socialwelfareappeals.ie/uploads/Jurisdiction_of_Appeals_Process-3.pdf">list
of social welfare schemes and benefits covered by the Social Welfare Appeals
Office (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office also deals with appeals for some payments
under the <a shape="rect" href="../payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allowance_scheme.html">Supplementary
Welfare Allowance Scheme</a>. However, it does not deal with the discretionary
elements of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme. </p>

<h3>Appeals procedure</h3>

<p>If you have been refused a social welfare payment or you disagree with a <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Decision-Making-and-Natural-Justice.aspx">decision
of a Deciding Officer or Designated Person</a> you must appeal within 21 days
of the decision. In exceptional cases, appeals received outside of this period
may be accepted. You must set out in your appeal why you think the decision was
not correct and include any evidence and documents you want to be considered by
the Social Welfare Appeals Office. </p>

<p>You must also enclose a copy of the letter you got from the Deciding
Officer/Designated Person that informed you of the decision you now wish to
appeal. You must always be given the reasons for the decision in writing and
the letter should be written in language that you can understand. </p>

<p>You can request an oral hearing at this stage. (See also ‘How to apply’
below.) The Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO) will send you a letter to let
you know that they have received your appeal. </p>

<table border="1" style="width: 100%"><caption></caption>
  <col><tbody><tr><td><strong>Clarification</strong> 

        <p>In some cases the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO) receives an
        appeal and, on review, decides that the reasons for the decision were
        not fully understood by you. In these cases the SWAO will refer the
        letter of appeal to the relevant scheme area of the Department of
        Social Protection and ask for the decision to be clarified to you. You
        are informed of this. If you are still not happy with the decision
        following the Department’s clarification you can appeal the decision
        to the SWAO.</p>
      </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>Once an appeal has been lodged the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO)
notifies the Department of Social Protection of the appeal. This notification
requires that any files or documents relevant to the appeal are forwarded to
the SWAO.</p>

<p>When the Department of Social Protection receives notice of an appeal it
reviews the original decision to decide whether it should be revised in your
favour. In some cases, this means that new evidence is reviewed by a medical
assessor or a social welfare inspector. If the decision is changed by the
Department at this stage you will be informed.</p>

<p>If the decision is not changed by the Department, your case will be examined
by an Appeals Officer.</p>

<p>In general appeals are dealt with in the order in which they have been
received. However Supplementary Welfare Allowance appeals (including Rent
Supplement) are prioritised for attention as soon as the file and submission is
received from the Department. The Appeals Officer may decide your appeal on the
basis of written evidence. This is called deciding the appeal
<em>summarily</em>.</p>

<h3>Oral hearings</h3>

<p>Your appeal may be heard at an oral hearing—either because you have
requested one or because the Appeals Officer decided that this is appropriate
for your appeal. You will be invited to attend this hearing. It is informal and
you can bring a representative to the hearing with you for support or
assistance. A representative may include a friend, colleague, public
representative or trade union official. You are also free to bring legal
representation if you wish—but this is not a requirement. Hearings are held
in private. If you live in Dublin or the surrounding areas hearings are held at
the Social Welfare Appeals Office (see address below). Outside Dublin hearings
are held at a venue as near as possible to where you live.</p>

<p>Generally, the decision of an Appeals Officer is final. However, an Appeals
Officer may revise their decision if new evidence, new facts or any relevant
change of circumstances come to light after a decision is made.</p>

<h3>If you don't agree with the Appeals Officer's decision</h3>

<p>The Chief Appeals Officer may revise a decision of an Appeals Officer if it
appears that a mistake was made in relation to the law or the facts. In either
case you should send a written request for a revised decision and enclose the
new evidence. It is important to state the grounds on which you are seeking a
revised decision.</p>

<p>If you are seeking a review by the Chief Appeals Officer, you must give
specific reasons why you believe a mistake has been made regarding the law or
the facts.</p>

<p>If you disagree with the final decision of the Social Welfare Appeals Office
you can request the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/office_of_the_ombudsman.html">Office
of the Ombudsman</a> to examine your case. The Ombudsman can examine complaints
about the actions of the SWAO and can also investigate complaints about the
everyday administrative activities carried out by the SWAO.</p>

<p>You may appeal to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/high_court.html">High Court</a> on a point of law
or seek a judicial review in the High Court if you think that the appeal was
not fairly conducted. You should however get legal advice in this situation.</p>

<h3>Non-statutory social welfare schemes</h3>

<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office does not deal with schemes that are not on
a statutory basis - for example, the Household Benefits Scheme or the Free
Travel Scheme. There is no formal appeals system for these schemes. However, if
you are not satisfied, you should ask for the decision to be reviewed by the
section in the Department of Social Protection that dealt with your
application.</p>

<h3>Social Welfare Tribunal</h3>
</div>

<p>The Social Welfare Tribunal is a special statutory appeals system for people
who are refused Jobseeker's Benefit or Jobseeker's Allowance because of an
industrial dispute at their place of employment. It provides a second level of
appeal after an appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. However, you can
also appeal directly to the Tribunal without first going through the Social
Welfare Appeals Office.<br></p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>There is no fee for making an appeal about a social welfare decision to the
Social Welfare Appeals Office. </p>

<p>If you have to travel to attend a hearing, the Social Welfare Appeals Office
will compensate you for any reasonable travel expenses. You can also be
compensated for any loss of earnings if you have to take time off work to
attend. The Social Welfare Appeals Office may make an award to a representative
such as a solicitor if they accompany you to the appeal.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You make your application on the special <a href="http://www.socialwelfareappeals.ie/uploads/SWAO1.pdf">Social Welfare
Appeals form (pdf),</a> also available from <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/List-of-Social-Welfare-Local-and-Branch-Offices-by-County.aspx">your
Intreo centre or social welfare local office</a> or the Social Welfare Appeals
Office. Alternatively, you may set out the grounds of your appeal in a letter
to the Appeals Office or by email to <a href="mailto:swappeals@welfare.ie">swappeals@welfare.ie</a>. The important
thing is that you set out your case fully.</p>

<p>You must include the following information in your appeal: </p>
<ul><li>Your name </li>
  <li>Your address </li>
  <li>Your <a shape="rect" href="personal_public_service_number.html">Personal
    Public Service Number</a> </li>
  <li>The payment you are claiming</li>
  <li>The decision you are appealing against</li>
  <li>The reasons you disagree with the decision</li>
  <li>A copy of the letter of refusal from the Department of Social
  Protection</li>
</ul><p>You may request an oral hearing when you submit your appeal. Usually people
request oral hearings because they wish to elaborate on some aspect of the
evidence or they consider that they can make their case better if they appear
in person to present their evidence. In some cases, the Appeals Officer decides
to hold an oral hearing.</p>

<p>You can get help with making an appeal from your Citizens Information
Service.</p>

<p>Further information is available in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.socialwelfareappeals.ie/uploads/sw56_2015_.pdf">Social Welfare
Appeals Office - An Introduction (pdf).</a> Information and advice is also
available from your Intreo centre, local social welfare office or from the
Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>

<div class="topic">

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>To qualify <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s
Allowance (JA)</a> you must satisfy a mean test. In a means test the Department
of Social Protection examines all your sources of income to test if they fall
below a certain level. If they fall below that level you will get Jobseeker’s
Allowance. The amount of Jobseeker’s Allowance you get depends on your income
level.</p>

<p>In the means test for Jobseeker’s Allowance <strong>your household
income</strong> is assessed. If you are married, in a civil partnership or
cohabitating, the means of your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant are also
taken into account. Sometimes a certain amount of income or income from
particular sources is not taken into account. Income not taken into account is
often referred to as <em>income disregards</em>. </p>

<p>The means test for Jobseeker’s Allowance can be a complex calculation.
Here we look at some of the general items that are taken into account in the
means test.</p>

<p>The means test examines the following types of income:</p>
<ul><li>Cash income (including income from work) </li>
  <li>Property personally used </li>
  <li>Capital (savings and investments) and property not personally used </li>
  <li>Benefit and privilege from living with your parents. </li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lde655">Cash income</h2>

<p>The means test assesses all cash income that you expect to get in the
forthcoming year. If it is not possible to estimate your income over the next
12 months, it is usually based on the income you actually received in the
previous year. </p>

<p>Among the cash income that is assessed is: </p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/unemployed_people/self_employed_and_unemployment.html">Income
    from self-employment</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="work_and_jobseekers_allowance.html">Income from
    employment</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/OperationalGuidelines/pages/farmmeans.aspx">Farm
    income</a> </li>
  <li>Income from a social security pension from another country </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="maintenance_and_social_welfare_payments.html">Income from
    maintenance</a>, for example, if you are separated. </li>
</ul><p>Most social welfare payment are not taken into account. Find out more about
<a shape="rect" href="cash_income_not_included_in_the_social_welfare_means_test.html">cash
income not included in the means test</a>.</p>

<h2>Property personally used</h2>

<p>The house in which you live is not included in the assessment of your means
unless you are getting an income from it. If you have rented a room in the
house, that income is assessed but the capital value of your home is not.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l4570f">Capital and property not personally used</h2>

<p>Capital includes property (<strong>not</strong> your home), savings and
investments. </p>

<p>If you own property (excluding your home) or you have investments or any
other form of capital, the value is assessed, using a standard formula (see
below) whether or not you are getting an income from the property or
investment. If property is rented you will not be assessed on the actual income
from the letting. Any outstanding mortgage registered against the property is
deducted from the market value to find the capital value.</p>

<p>The property and investments that may be assessed include savings in a bank
account (or anywhere else), a house that you have let and stocks and shares. If
you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant saves a portion of your social
welfare payment each week, these savings as well as savings from most other
sources will be taken into account as part of your means.</p>

<p>The formula for assessing the value of capital including property (but not
your own home), savings and investments is as follows:</p>

<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" border="1" width="400" summary=""><thead><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>Capital </strong></td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>Weekly means assessed</strong></td>
    </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">First €20,000</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Nil</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Next €10,000</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€1 per €1,000</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Next €10,000</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€2 per €1,000</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Balance (€40,000 +)</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€4 per €1,000</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<p>If you have a <strong>joint account</strong> with your spouse, civil partner
or cohabitant, legally the total amount in the account is owned by each of you.
Therefore it can be assessed in full against each of you. However, if you are
both getting means-tested payments it will be assessed on a shared basis or
against only one of you.</p>

<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" border="1" width="700" summary=""><thead><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>For example</strong> </td>
    </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>If you have €55,000 savings:</p>

        <p>The first €20,000 is assessed as nil, €20,000 to €30,000 is
        assessed as €10, €30,000 to €40,000 is assessed as €20,
        €40,000 and €55,000 is assessed as €60. </p>

        <p>€10 + €20 + €60 = €90</p>

        <p>Savings of €55,000 gives a means of €90 per week.</p>
      </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l858f3">Living with your parents</h2>

<p>If you are <strong>24 years of age or under</strong> and you are living with
a parent or a step-parent in the family home, some of your parents' income will
also be taken into account in the assessment for Jobseeker's Allowance. </p>

<p>This is called an assessment of the <em>benefit and privilege</em> you get
from living with your parents. More information is available on <a shape="rect" href="how_parents_income_can_affect_jobseekers_allowance.html">how benefit and
privilege is assessed in the means test</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l2ae4c">Total means</h2>

<p>To find your total means, your means under the various headings (for
example, cash income, employment, capital, benefit and privilege) are added
together. If you are married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting and your
partner is getting a social welfare payment in their own right your means may
be halved - see ‘Couples’ below.</p>

<p>Your total household means is then deducted from the maximum payment for
your situation (see below) to find the actual amount of Jobseeker’s Allowance
you are entitled to.</p>

<p><strong>Maximum payment for your situation</strong></p>

<p>The maximum payment for your situation is the maximum personal rate of
Jobseeker's Allowance including any increases for adult and child dependants.
However, if you are married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting and your
spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is getting a social welfare payment in
their own right, your joint means are halved and the maximum payment for your
situation will <strong>not</strong> include an increase for an adult dependant
and will only include half-rate increases for your child dependants (see
'Couples' below).</p>

<p>Your age can also determine the maximum payment for your situation. More
information on the JA rate for people under 26 can be found in our document on
<a shape="rect" href="../../payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
Allowance</a>.</p>

<p>If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant has a social welfare payment in
their own right (except Child Benefit, Disablement Pension, <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/death_related_benefits/guardians_payments.html">guardian's
payments</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary
Welfare Allowance</a>, <a href="../../social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/domiciliary_care_allowance.html">Domiciliary
Care Allowance</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/carers/half_rate_carers_allowance.html">half-rate Carer's
Allowance</a>) or is on a SOLAS or VTOS course and getting a payment in their
own right you <strong>cannot</strong> claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult
for them. </p>

<p>This means that the maximum you can be paid is the maximum Jobseeker’s
Allowance payment for a single person plus a half-rate allowance for each
qualified child. (Your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant will get a half-rate
payment for each qualified child with their payment.) </p>

<p>In addition only 50% of your combined means are taken into account in the
means test for your Jobseeker’s Allowance - in other words <strong>your
combined means are halved</strong>. (The other half will be taken into account
in the means test for your partner's payment if your partner is getting a
means-tested payment.) </p>

<p>You can claim an increase for your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant while
they are taking part in a <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/community_employment_scheme.html">Community
Employment (CE)</a> scheme. Their earnings from the scheme are assessed in the
same way as earnings from insurable employment (and your combined means are not
halved). </p>

<p><strong>Limitation</strong></p>

<p>However, if you are claiming Jobseeker's Allowance and your spouse, civil
partner or cohabitant is getting of one of the social welfare payments listed
below, the total amount paid to you as a couple cannot be more than the maximum
amount that would be paid to one person (including adult and child dependants)
on one social welfare payment. If a couple are both claiming Jobseeker’s
Allowance in their own right the rate paid to each person is half of the family
rate. If one or both of the couple is aged 26 or under, each person is paid
half of the family rate that would apply to them individually. The total amount
payable to a couple where one or both are under 26 can vary depending on who
makes the claim (see examples below). </p>
<ul><li>Illness Benefit </li>
  <li>Disablement Pension (when paid with Illness Benefit or Incapacity
    Supplement) </li>
  <li>Injury Benefit </li>
  <li>Invalidity Pension </li>
  <li>State Pension (Non-Contributory) </li>
  <li>State Pension (Contributory) </li>
  <li>State Pension (Transition) </li>
  <li>Jobseeker's Benefit </li>
  <li>Jobseeker's Allowance </li>
  <li>Pre-Retirement Allowance (PRETA) </li>
  <li>Farm Assist (FA)</li>
</ul><p></p>

        Allowance. His partner Anna is getting Invalidity Pension.</p>

        <p>Anna and Paul have chosen Anna's Invalidity Pension as the primary
        payment rather than Paul's Jobseeker's Allowance because Invalidity
        Pension is paid at a higher weekly rate. </p>

        <p>Claimant on Invalidity Pension (IP) under 65 years €193.50<br>
        Qualified adult rate for IP under 65 years <u>€138.10<br></u>Maximum payable to Anna and Paul €331.60</p>

        <p>In this case Paul's JA payment is reduced to €138.10 and Anna is
        paid the full amount of IP. </p>

        <p><strong>Paul will get Jobseeker’s Allowance of

  <col><tbody><tr><td><strong>Examples for people under 26 claiming Jobseeker's
        Allowance</strong></td>
    </tr><tr><td><strong>Cian and Jane</strong>

        <p>Cian is 24 and his partner Jane is 25. Cian is claiming
        Jobseeker’s Allowance in his own right. If he made a claim for Jane
        as his qualified adult the rate payable for the couple would be €200
        (€100 each).</p>

        <p>However if Jane claimed for Cian as a qualified adult the total
        amount paid would be €268.80 (€144 for Jane and €124.80 for
        Cian).</p>

        <p>If they both claim JA separately each person would get half of the
        family rate that applies to them. So if Jane made a claim in her own
        right for Jobseeker’s Allowance her rate would be €134.40 and Cian
        could claim JA of €100. The total paid to the couple would be
        €234.40.</p>

        <p>It may be more beneficial for Cian to claim JA in his own right so
        he can access activation measures and qualify for employment or
        training schemes in his own right.</p>

    </tr><tr><td><p><strong>James and Grainne</strong></p>

        <p>James is 29 and his partner Grainne is 25.</p>

        <p>If James claims JA for himself and includes Grainne as a qualified
        adult on his payment the rate payable for the couple would be €312.60
        (€188 for James and €124.60 for Grainne).</p>

        <p>If Grainne claimed JA in her own right with a payment for James as a
        qualified adult, the total paid would be €268.80 (€144 for Grainne
        and €124.80 for James).</p>

        <p>If they both claim JA separately each person would get half of the
        family rate that applies to them. So James would get a personal rate of
        €156.40 (312.60/2) and Grainne would receive €134.40 (268.80/2).</p>

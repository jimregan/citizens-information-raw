<p>If you are applying for a <a shape="rect" href="../social_assistance_payments/social_assistance_in_ireland.html">social
assistance payment</a> you must satisfy a means test. All your sources of
income (for example, cash income, employment, capital and maintenance) are
assessed in a means test by the Department of Social Protection (DSP). </p>

<p>However, under social welfare legislation certain items are not counted when
your means are assessed for a social assistance payment. This document looks at
cash income not included in the means test. More information on income not
taken into account is available in our document on the <a shape="rect" href="means_test.html">means test</a>.</p>

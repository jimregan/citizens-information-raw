<p>The main Budget changes which may affect people living in Ireland are set
out below. </p>

<p>This document sets out changes in the areas of social welfare, tax, health,
transport, environment, housing, education, employment and other areas. It is
an overview and not a complete statement of the measures announced in Budget
2011. <strong>The document will be expanded and updated as information becomes
available</strong>.</p>

<p>Some of the changes announced in the Budget come into effect immediately.
Others take effect from the beginning of January 2011. Many others have to be
finalised before coming into effect. Some elements of these measures may change
when the Finance Bill is published – this is expected in early 2011.</p>

<p>For a full list of the Budget changes, please read the Department of
Finance’s <a href="http://www.budget.gov.ie">Summary of Budget
Measures</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lae27e">Social Welfare</h2>

<h3>Rates of payment</h3>

<h3>Older people</h3>

<p>There will be no change in the rates of State pensions or other payments for
those aged over 66, for example, Living Alone Allowance, Household Benefits
Scheme and Fuel Allowance.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>People of working age</h3>

<p>The maximum personal rate of payment for all weekly schemes will be reduced
by €8 per week, except for personal rates for those aged 66 and over, and
Invalidity Pension and State Pension Transition recipients aged 65. Changes
will come into effect from the first week in January 2011.</p>

<p>Associated maximum Increase for a Qualified Adult will generally decrease by
€5.30 per week from the first week in January 2011.</p>

<p>Proportionate decreases will apply to both personal rates and Increase for a
Qualified Adult in respect of people on reduced social insurance rates of
payment.</p>

<p>There will be a decrease of €8 per week in the maximum and minimum rate of
Maternity and Adoptive Benefits.</p>

<p>There will be a reduction of €6 per week in the rate of Jobseeker’s
Allowance and Supplementary Welfare Allowance for those aged 22-24.</p>

<p>The rate of payment of Jobseeker’s Allowance and Supplementary Welfare
Allowance for those aged 18-21 is unchanged.</p>

<p>There will be a reduction of €10 in the personal weekly rate of
Supplementary Welfare Allowance.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Fuel Allowance</h3>

<p>In response to the current severe weather, a once-off additional 2 weeks
payment will be paid to most recipients in the next few weeks, with the
remainder of recipients getting this payment in early January. This measure
will be worth €40 to recipients.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>Child Benefit will be reduced by €10 per month from January 2011 on both
the lower and higher rate with an additional €10 per month decrease for the
third child. Grants for multiple births (twins etc.) will not be reduced.</p>

<p>Other child-related payments are unchanged: Qualified Child Increases,
Family Income Supplement, Back to School Footwear and Clothing Allowance,
Widowed Parent Grant and Domiciliary Care Allowance.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Carers</h3>

<p>The rate of payment will be reduced by €8 for carers aged under 66. Carers
aged 66 or over will not be affected.</p>

<p>There are no other changes to Carer’s schemes: the half-rate payment, the
additional payment for caring for more than one person and the Respite Care
Grant are retained.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Rent Supplement</h3>

<p>The Rent Supplement Scheme will be reformed in order to control expenditure.
This will include an additional €2 per week contribution by certain welfare
recipients towards the cost of rent. This follows from the reduction in the
rate of Supplementary Welfare Allowance.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Treatment Benefits</h3>

<p>The Treatment Benefit Scheme will continue to be limited in 2011 to the
Medical and Surgical Appliances scheme and the free examination elements of the
Dental and Optical Benefit schemes.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Other measures</h3>

<p>There will be a reduction in expenditure on Departmental administration. A
range of other measures relating to control, eligibility and structural reform
will be announced at a later date.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Jobseeker's Allowance</h3>

<p>The rates below relate to claimants who have no assessable means.</p>

<h3>National minimum wage</h3>

<p>The national minimum wage rate is to be reduced by €1 per hour as stated

of Understanding of the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland

reduction in their wages would be a <a href="../employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/contracts_of_employment/change_job_contract.html">change
to their terms and conditions of employment</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Relevant Contracts Tax</h3>

<p>Relevant Contracts Tax applies to contractors in the construction,

trade in 2011. The scheme is being modified so that the value of the relief
will be linked to the amount of employers’ PRSI paid by a company in an
accounting period subject to a maximum of €5,000 per employee. If the amount
of qualifying employers’ PRSI is lower than the reduction in corporation tax
liability otherwise applicable, relief will be based on the lower amount 

<p>The Business Expansion Scheme will be transformed into the Employment and
Investment Incentive with an increase in the amount that companies can raise
under the scheme.</p>

reduced from €150,000 (2010) to €115,000 for 2011.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Employee pension contributions</h3>

<p>Employee contributions to occupational pension schemes and other pension
arrangements will be subject to employee PRSI and the Universal Social Charge
from 1 January 2011</p>

<p></p>

<p>The current employer PRSI exemption for employee contributions to
occupational pension schemes and other pension arrangements will be reduced by
50% from 1 January 2011.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Maximum allowable pension funds</h3>

<p>The maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes (known as
the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT)), is to be set at €2.3 million with effect
from 7 December 2010. A higher threshold may apply if, on 7 December 2010, the
capital value of an individual’s pension rights drawn down on or after 7
December 2005 (i.e. crystallised pension rights) when added to any
uncrystallised pension rights the individual may have, as valued on 7 December
2010, are greater than €2.3 million and lower than €5,418,085 which is the
current value of the SFT. This change will apply with effect from 1 January
2011.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Approved Retirement Funds</h3>

<p>The annual imputed distribution which applies to the value of assets in an
Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) at 31 December each year is being increased from

<p></p>

<h3>Retirement lump sums</h3>

<p>The overall life-time limit on the amount of tax-free retirement lump sums
that an individual can draw down from pension arrangements is being reduced to

rate (currently 20%) up to €575,000 (25% of the new Standard Fund Threshold).
Anything over this amount will be taxed at the taxpayer’s marginal rate of
income tax. </p>

<p>Tax-free retirement lump sums taken on or after 7 December 2005 will count
towards “using up” the new tax free amount so that if a person has already
taken tax free retirement lump sums of €200,000 or more since 7 December
2005, any further retirement lump sums paid to them on or after 1 January 2011
will be taxable. These earlier lump sums will also count towards determining
how much of a lump sum paid on or after Budget day is to be charged at the
standard or marginal tax rate. This change will apply with effect from 1
January 2011.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Extension of flexible options on retirement</h3>

<p>All members of defined contribution pension arrangements will have access to
flexible options on retirement in respect of the main benefits arising from
those schemes, subject to certain conditions. These will be provided for in the

<h3>School transport</h3>

<p>The school transport charge for post-primary students increases by €50 to
€350 per year, with a maximum charge of €650 per family.</p>

<p>A new charge of €50 is introduced for primary school pupils, except for

pupils attending primary schools. This means that children who live less than
3.2 kilometres (2 miles) from school, and who get free transport under the
“closed school” rule at present, will lose their transport eligibility.</p>

<p>Services for very small numbers of pupils will be discontinued. A minimum of
10 eligible children (up from 7 at present) will be required to establish or

Youthreach.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Student charges</h3>

<p>The Student Services Charge for third-level students is replaced by a
flat-rate higher education student contribution of €2,000 per year.
Arrangements will be made to provide that second and subsequent siblings from a
single family will not have to bear the full increased cost of the new €2,000
charge.</p>

<p>It is intended that this contribution will be payable in two instalments.
Students qualifying for third-level grants will not have to pay it.</p>

<p>A new charge of €200 per year is introduced for Post-Leaving Certificate
(PLC) students. Students qualifying for maintenance grants will not have to pay
this charge.</p>

<p>The benefits payable to mature students will be limited to those payable to
ordinary students. Mature students will no longer be automatically eligible for
the non-adjacent rate of grant.</p>

<p>The proportion of students qualifying for the non-adjacent rate of grant
will be reduced by changing the qualifying distance between the student’s
home and college from 24km to 45km. It is expected that these changes will take
effect from the 2011/2012 academic year.</p>

<p></p>

Social Protection (DSP) working-age payments.</p>

<p>The long-term unemployment bonus paid to students on the Vocational Training
Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) is reduced from €31.80 to €20 per week.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Labour market activation programmes</h3>

<p>The National Employment Action Plan will be refocused to establish clearer
pathways to employment by ensuring that State agencies interact early and often
with those who have lost their jobs to provide opportunities for education,
training or work experience placements as appropriate.</p>

<p>An additional 15,000 activation places and supports for the unemployed will
be provided under the following programmes:</p>
<ul><li>A new Skills Development and Internship Programme will provide up to
    5,000 places in the private sector.</li>

<h3>Income supports</h3>

<p>The supplementary Blind Welfare Allowance paid to blind people who receive

pensioner and from €122.00 to €117.00 for a blind couple.</p>

<h3>Disability and mental health</h3>

<p>There will be a maximum reduction of 1.8% in the Budget allocation for the
two sectors.</p>

<p>An additional €10 million funding will be provided to the HSE for

residential, respite and personal assistant/home support hours for people with
disabilities and day places for school leavers in September 2011.</p>

<p>An additional €1m has been provided for suicide prevention. The National
Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) will target:</p>
<ul><li>Development of the number and range of training and awareness
  programmes</li>
  <li>Improvements and standardised responses to deliberate self harm</li>
  <li>Development of the capacity of primary care to respond to suicidal
    behaviour and consider new models of response</li>
  <li>Ensuring that helpline supports for those in emotional distress are
    coordinated and widely publicised</li>
</ul><p></p>

extra recipients at any one time, or up to 800 during the year 2011.</p>

<p>An additional €6m for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Fair Deal Scheme)
was announced. This funding takes account of the increasing number of older
people that require long-term nursing home care due to demographic trends.</p>

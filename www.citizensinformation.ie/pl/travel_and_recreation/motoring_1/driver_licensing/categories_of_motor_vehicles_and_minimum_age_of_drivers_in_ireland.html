<p>Motor vehicles in Ireland are divided into different categories for driver
licensing purposes. This is a standard practice throughout the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/european_government/european_union.html">European
Union</a>. Each category of vehicle has a prescribed minimum age for the
driver. In other words, before you can apply for a licence to drive a vehicle
in Ireland, you must be a certain age. </p>

<p>When you apply for your driving licence or a learner permit, the categories
of vehicles you are authorised to drive/operate are listed on your licence. It
is a serious offence to drive any vehicle for which you do not have a licence.
</p>

<p>On 19 January 2013 <a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/transport/road_transport/l24141_en.htm">Directive
2006/126/EC (as amended)</a> on driving licences came into effect. This
increased the number of vehicle categories from 14 to 15 and the minimum age
requirement for certain categories was also changed. Further information on the
various driving licence changes is available on the <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Licensed-Drivers/Driving-Licence-Changes/Driving-Licence-Changes-January-2013/New-Driver-Licensing-Rules/">Road
Safety Authority's website</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Whether you have a driving licence or a learner permit, you are only
entitled to drive the category of vehicle for which the licence or permit has
been issued. </p>

<p>If you wish to have another category of motor vehicle added to your existing
driving licence or learner permit, your existing licence/permit must be in
date. Certain categories of vehicles may be added to your existing learner
permit without the requirement of submitting a <a shape="rect" href="../driving_tests/driver_theory_test.html">driver theory test
certificate</a>. To add other categories, it does involve a driver theory
test.</p>

<h3>Motorcycles and mopeds</h3>

<p>Since 19 January 2013, the categories and driver’s minimum age for
motorcycles and mopeds are as follows:</p>

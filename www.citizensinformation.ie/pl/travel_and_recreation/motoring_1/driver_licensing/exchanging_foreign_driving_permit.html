<p>It is possible to exchange a driving licence issued by an <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/european_government/european_union.html">EU member
state</a> or an EEA member state (Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland) for an
Irish driving licence. It is also possible to exchange a driving licence issued
by certain <em>recognised</em> states for an Irish driving licence. </p>

<p>If you are the holder of a driving licences issued by a country that is not
recognised for driving licence exchange, you cannot exchange your licence for
an Irish licence. You will only get an Irish driving licence after you have
gone through the full driver licensing procedure, starting with the <a shape="rect" href="../driving_tests/driver_theory_test.html">driver theory
test</a>.</p>

<p>If your current driving licence was issued to you when you exchanged for it
a driving licence issued by a country that is not recognised for driving
licence exchange, then you cannot exchange your driving licence for an Irish
driving licence.</p>

<p>You can access the <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/rsa/learner-drivers/your-learner-permit/rules-of-the-road/">rules
of the road</a> on the Road Safety Authority’s website.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Holders of licences issued by an EU/EEA member state</h3>

<p>If you have a driving licence issued by an EU/EEA member state you can drive
in Ireland as long as your existing licence is valid. If you wish to exchange
your driving licence for an equivalent Irish driving licence when it expires,
you must do so within 10 years of your driving licence expiring. </p>

<h3>Holders of licences issued by a recognised state</h3>

<p>Ireland has agreements with certain other countries/states that designates
them as recognised states for the purposes of driving licence exchange. These
are:</p>
<ul><li>Australia* </li>
  <li>Gibraltar </li>
  <li>Guernsey </li>
  <li>Isle of Man </li>
  <li>Japan </li>
  <li>Jersey</li>
  <li>Manitoba Province of Canada*</li>
  <li>New Zealand*</li>
  <li>Newfoundland and Labrador Province of Canada* </li>
  <li>Ontario Province of Canada*</li>
  <li>South Africa </li>
  <li>South Korea </li>
  <li>Switzerland </li>
  <li>Taiwan*</li>
</ul><p>* See the <a href="https://www.ndls.ie/holders-of-foreign-licences.html#holders-of-licences-issued-by-recognised-states">National
Driver Licence Service (NDLS) website</a> for more information. </p>

<p>If you are a holder of a licence issued by one of the above states you can
drive in Ireland for up to 1 year when visiting, providing your licence is
valid. If you become normally resident in Ireland, you should exchange your
driving licence or begin the process of applying for an Irish driving licence.
You are considered to be normally resident in Ireland if, because of personal
and occupational ties, you usually live here for at least 185 days in each
calendar year. (An EU licence holder can drive on the EU licence for as long as
the licence is valid without the need to exchange.)</p>

<p>If you wish to exchange your driving licence for an equivalent Irish driving
licence, you must do so within 1 year of your driving licence expiring for
Non-EU licence holders (10 years for EU licence holders). </p>

<h3>Holders of driving licences from other countries</h3>

<p>If you are not from any of the above countries, (for example, if you are
from the United States), and you hold a national driving licence and an <a shape="rect" href="international_driving_permit.html">international driving
permit</a> from your own country, you may drive in Ireland for the duration of
your temporary visit (up to 12 months). </p>

<p>If your stay in Ireland will be more than 12 months you can apply for an
Irish driving licence but you will need to go through the full driver licensing
procedure. You must first complete a <a shape="rect" href="../driving_tests/driver_theory_test.html">driver theory test</a>, apply
for a <a shape="rect" href="learner_driving_permits_for_cars_and_work_vehicles.html">learner driving
permit</a> and complete your <a shape="rect" href="../driving_tests/driving_test.html">driving test</a> in Ireland. If you
pass your driving test, you will be issued with an <a shape="rect" href="full_driving_licence.html">Irish driving licence</a>. </p>

<h3>Driving offences committed in other jurisdictions</h3>

<p>Penalty points and endorsements on driving licences acquired in other states
(including EU/EEA member states) are not recognised in Ireland. This is because
these penalties have been issued by courts in other jurisdictions. In practice,
this means that if you acquired penalty points or an endorsement on a driving
licence before coming to Ireland, these penalty points or endorsements do not
transfer over to an Irish driving licence. If, however, you have been banned
from driving in another jurisdiction (for example, for drink driving) it may
not be possible for you to exchange your existing licence for an Irish driving
licence.</p>

<p>If you are driving on a foreign driving licence in Ireland and acquire
penalty points here, you will receive the normal statutory fine and a record
will be created to record the penalty points. If you accumulate 12 penalty
points in a 3-year period you are disqualified from driving in Ireland. </p>

<p>Driver testing in Ireland is carried out directly by the Road Safety
Authority to a standard that complies with the EU Directive on Driving
Licences. Testing is conducted out of <a shape="rect" href="http://www.rsa.ie/Utility/Contact-Us/Driving-Test-Centres/">test centres
throughout the country</a> and where possible, your test will be arranged for
the centre you nominate on your application form.</p>

<p>A driving test is a compulsory requirement for motorists who have been
issued with two 2-year learner permits. It's important to be aware that
<span>you may not apply for a third or subsequent learner permit for any
category of vehicle unless you can show evidence that you have applied for a
driving test</span>. </p>

<p>You cannot take a driving test for at least 6 months after getting your
first learner permit (where you are not changing from a provisional licence to
a learner permit) in the case of motorcycles, cars and work vehicles. A holder
of a current full driving licence from another country for more than 6 months
is exempt from this requirement. However, they require a letter of entitlement
from the licensing authority in that country which they should forward, with
their current driving licence, to the Customer Service Manager in the Driver
Testing Section of the Road Safety Authority.</p>

<p><strong>From 19 January 2013,</strong> changes are being introduced to
driver licence categories and to some of the representative vehicles used for
driving tests. You can find information on the <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Licensed-Drivers/Driving-Licence-Changes/Driving-Licence-Changes-January-2013/New-Driver-Licensing-Rules/">driver
licence categories</a> and the <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/Documents/Learner%20Drivers/Third%20Directive/Link%206%20Representative%20vehicles%20for%20the%20driving%20test%20@%2018th%20July%202012.pdf">representative
vehicles for driving tests (pdf)</a> on the Road Safety Authority's website.
Information on how it affects those who already have motorcycle learner permits
is available in a <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/Documents/Learner%20Drivers/Third%20Directive/Link%20B%20FAQ's%20Bikes.pdf">motorcycle
FAQ (pdf)</a>. Information for those with bus and truck learner permits is
available in a <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/Documents/Learner%20Drivers/Third%20Directive/Link%20C%20Bus%20and%20Truck%20FAQ's.pdf">bus
and truck FAQ (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Applying for the test</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.rsa.ie/RSA/Learner-Drivers/The-Driving-Test/Driving-Test-Centre/Waiting-Times/">Waiting
times</a> vary from county to county; so it is advisable to apply for a test
about 6 months before your second <a shape="rect" href="../driver_licensing/learner_driving_permits_for_cars_and_work_vehicles.html">learner
permit</a> is due to expire. It is a standard test and all test centres use the
same testing procedures. You can now apply and pay for your driving test online
(see 'How to apply' below). </p>

<h3>Preparing for the test</h3>

<p>A driving test is designed to determine that you:</p>
<ul><li>Know the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.rotr.ie/">Rules of the Road</a>
  </li>
  <li>Possess the knowledge and skill to drive competently in accordance with
    those rules </li>
  <li>Drive with proper regard for the safety and convenience of other road
    users. </li>
</ul><p>Prior to your driving test you should study the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.rsa.ie/Documents/Learner%20Drivers/Rules_of_the_road.pdf">Rules
of the Road (pdf)</a>, a booklet which is published by the Road Safety
Authority and is available from bookshops, priced â‚¬5. It is also a good idea
to practice driving as much as possible on all types of roads and in all types
of traffic situations. This will improve your driving techniques and build your
confidence. </p>

<p>On the day of your test, give yourself plenty of time to arrive at the test
centre with a few minutes to spare. If your first learner permit was issued
since 4 April 2011 you should bring your logbook from the <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Driver-Training/Car-Training-EDT/">Essential
Driver Training (EDT)</a> you have completed. When your name is called and you
are brought into the examination room, your test officially begins.</p>

<h3>Technical checks of vehicle</h3>

<p>If you are doing a driving test for categories B (car), EB (car with
trailer) and W (work vehicle) you must explain some technical checks as part of
your test. After you have answered some questions on the Rules of the Road, the
instructor will bring you out to your vehicle. You will be asked <span>how a
technical check</span> would be performed on <span>3 of the following</span>;
steering, horn, brakes, tyres, lights, reflectors, indicators, engine oil,
coolant, windscreen washer fluid. Access to these items will require you
demonstrate how to open the bonnet and to close it securely. Read <a shape="rect" href="http://www.rsa.ie/Documents/Learner%20Drivers/Preparing_driving_test_DL_v2.pdf">more
detailed information on technical checks for all motor vehicles here</a>. </p>

<p>If you are doing a test for categories C1, C, EC1 and EC (truck and trucks
with trailers) you will be asked how a <span>technical check</span> would be
peformed on three of the same items above. Access to these items will require
you to open and securely close the bonnet, to open/close panels etc.</p>

<h3>Practical test of skills</h3>

<p>Your driving test in Ireland will take approximately 30 minutes to complete
(depending on traffic). You will be given clear instructions throughout the
test, but if you don't understand something, ask the examiner to repeat it.
<span>Do not panic</span> if you make a mistake during the test. It may not be
as serious as you think and it may not mean you have failed. </p>

<p>You will be assessed in the following situations: moving off, driving in
traffic, stopping, reversing round a corner, a turn about, a hill-start and
parking. </p>

<p>The aspects of your driving that will be assessed include road positioning;
overtaking and passing; anticipation and observation; use of mirrors and
signals, progress; speed; compliance with traffic lights, road signs and road
markings; and proper use of your vehicle controls. At some point during your
test, the examiner will ask you to demonstrate your hand signals. You can also
expect to make a number of left and right turns, encounter a roundabout and
stop at traffic lights. </p>

<p>When you return to the test centre your examiner will bring you back into
the examination room to give you the result. If you pass, you will be given a
Certificate of Competency, which is valid for 2 years. If you fail to apply for
a full licence during this 2 year period, you will have to complete your
driving test again. If you fail your driving test, you will be given a detailed
list of your mistakes, which you should study and rectify before you sit
another driving test.</p>

<h3>Facilities for motorists with a disability/non-English speakers</h3>

<p>If you have a hearing impairment you may have an interpreter accompany you
for this part of the test. Your interpreter may not be your driving instructor
and they cannot accompany you on the practical part of your test. The tester
may show written instructions for this part of the test and display them as
appropriate; the tester may also use basic sign language. You should also note
that if the vehicle you present for the test is adapted to suit a disability
(e.g., it has additional controls), this will be noted on your full driving
licence. If you have special needs, you should indicate this on the application
form for your driving test so that any necessary arrangements will be in place
when you attend for your test. </p>

<p>It is possible to apply for your driving test to be conducted through Irish.
(You will need to complete the Irish language version of the application form
and submit as normal). If English is not your first language, you may have an
interpreter accompany you for this part of the test. Again, your interpreter
may not be your driving instructor and they cannot accompany you on the
practical part of the test. The tester may show written instructions for this
part of the test and display them as appropriate. </p>

<p>The examiner will ask to see your licence and ask you to sign a form stating
that the car is both roadworthy and insured. You will then have to answer some
random questions from the <span>Rules of the Road</span>. The examiner will
then accompany you to your car to begin the practical side of your test. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>There are a number of things you need to do in preparation for your driving
test and a number of legal requirements you must comply with.</p>
<ul><li>You must have a current learner permit to sit a driving test. </li>
  <li>Current <a shape="rect" href="../motor_tax_and_insurance/motor_tax_rates.html">motor tax</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../motor_tax_and_insurance/motor_insurance.html">insurance discs</a>
    and an <a href="../../vehicle_standards/national_car_test.html">NCT
    certificate</a> (if applicable) must be displayed on the vehicle you are
    using. </li>
  <li>L-plates should be displayed on the front and rear of the vehicle.</li>
  <li>Your vehicle must be <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/Documents/Learner%20Drivers/Third%20Directive/Link%206%20Representative%20vehicles%20for%20the%20driving%20test%20@%2018th%20July%202012.pdf">appropriate
    for the driver licence category</a> you are being tested for. </li>
  <li>The vehicle should be roadworthy, for example all tyres should have a
    minimum depth of 1.6mm - the legal thread depth limit for tyres in Ireland.
  </li>
  <li>Everything should be in perfect working order, e.g., windscreen wipers,
    indicators, mirrors, etc. </li>
  <li>The interior and exterior of your car should be clean. </li>
</ul><p>To explain how a technical check would be carried out on your vehicle, you
will be required to open the vehicle bonnnet and close it securely. </p>

<h3>Cancelling your driving test</h3>

<p>If for some reason you are unable to sit your driving test on the day you
are given, you may cancel this test but you will have to re-apply again. You
are urged to <span>notify Driver Testing immediately</span> if you need to
cancel your test. As waiting lists are very long, someone else could avail of
your slot. You will not forfeit your test fee if you give at least 10 days
notice and if you haven't previously cancelled more than one driving test
appointment on this application. Cancelling your driving test will mean that
you go <span>back to the end</span> of the waiting list again at the test
centre. You may cancel your driving test any time - (contact information for
Driver Testing under 'Where to apply' below). </p>

<p>Very occasionally the Driver Testing Service may have to cancel your test at
short notice. Every effort is made to notify the test candidate immediately. In
such circumstances, Driver Testing will arrange a further test <span>free of
charge</span> at the earliest date possible. The Road Safety Authority will
also consider reimbursing certain out of pocket expenses, e.g., hire of vehicle
on the day of the cancelled test, on receipt of the appropriate claim in the
Authority. (View contact information under 'Where to apply' below).</p>

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>A passport is an internationally recognised travel document confirming your
identity and nationality and you are only entitled to an Irish passport if you
are <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/irish_citizenship/your_right_to_irish_citizenship.html">an
Irish citizen</a>. This document explains how to apply for your
<strong>first</strong> Irish passport. In other documents you will find
information on:</p>
<ul><li><a href="renewing_an_irish_passport.html">Renewing an Irish
    passport</a></li>
  <li><a href="passports_for_children.html">Passports for children</a></li>
  <li><a href="replacing_a_lost_or_stolen_irish_passport.html">Replacing a
    lost or stolen passport</a></li>
  <li><a href="irish_passport_card.html">Irish passport cards</a></li>
</ul><p>Your passport is an important legal document. At all times, you should
ensure that it is kept in a secure place. Each Irish passport carries a unique
identification number and you should keep a note of your number, in the event
that your passport is lost or stolen. </p>

<p>As well as allowing you to travel abroad, your Irish passport entitles you
to certain <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_abroad/leaving_ireland/diplomatic_supports.html">diplomatic
support services</a> from Irish embassies abroad should you get into
difficulties. While your Irish passport is an internationally recognised travel
document, it does not give you an automatic right to enter other countries. </p>

<p>Your Irish passport is issued by the Irish Government through the Passport
Service of the <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/">Department of Foreign Affairs and
Trade</a> here in Ireland. Irish passports are also issued through Irish
embassies and consulates throughout the world, to whom you apply if you are
living abroad. </p>

<h4>Passport card</h4>

<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has introduced a new credit-card
sized Irish passport card which you can use for travel within the European
Union/European Economic Area (includes Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and
Switzerland. For all other travel you must use your normal passport.</p>

<p>Further information is available in our <a href="irish_passport_card.html">document on the Irish passport card</a>.</p>

<h4>Second passport</h4>

<p>If you would like to apply for a second passport for business purposes, you
must provide evidence to support your application. Second passports for
business purposes are issued with restricted periods of validity. <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/passports-citizenship/top-passport-questions/second-passport/">Information
on second passports</a> is available on the Department's website.</p>

<h3>Validity of Irish passports</h3>

<p>Irish citizens travelling to destinations outside the EU are subject to the
specific passport controls and requirements of those countries. This means, for
example, when travelling outside the EU, your passport may need to be valid for
a certain period. The arrangements vary from one country to another so contact
the <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=376">embassy of the relevant
country</a> before you travel for the most up-to-date information on these
requirements. </p>

<p>All EU citizens have the right to enter and live in the territory of another
member state of the EU for up to three months. You simply present a valid
passport or national identity card; no other formality is required. EU
countries cannot set additional conditions concerning the minimum validity or
duration of the identity card or passport. Basically this means that your
passport doesn't have to be valid for, say, 6 months before you are allowed
enter another EU country.</p>

<h3>Machine-readable passports</h3>

<p>A machine-readable passport is a passport with two typeface lines printed at
the bottom of the biographical page [the photo page], which can be read by
machine. When read, these lines electronically provide identical information to
that provided on the biographical page. </p>

<h3>Electronic passports (ePassports)</h3>

<p>In October 2006 the Passport Office began issuing Irish electronic passports
(ePassport). An electronic passport is the same as a normal machine-readable
passport with the addition of a small integrated circuit or <em>chip</em>
embedded in the photo page. The chip securely stores a digitised image of the
photo and personal details of the passport holder as they appear on the data
page of the passport, which allows the use of facial recognition technology at
border controls. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You <strong>must be an <a href="../../../moving_country/irish_citizenship">Irish citizen</a></strong> in
order to be eligible for an Irish passport.</p>

<p>You have a right to apply for a passport if you are aged 18 years or over.
If you are under 18, you will need the consent of both parents or guardian(s)
in writing in order to get your own passport - see <a href="passports_for_children.html">our document on passports for
children</a>. </p>

<h3>Name on passport</h3>

<p>Titles such as Mr, Mrs, Ms, Dr, Rev., Sir, Lord, Lady are not entered on
Irish passports.</p>

<p>A passport may be issued in the married or civil partnership name of an
applicant if a civil marriage certificate or a civil partnership certificate is
submitted.</p>

<p>If the name you are known by is different from the name on your <a href="../../../birth_family_relationships/after_your_baby_is_born/registering_birth_your_baby.html">birth
certificate</a> and it is not due to marriage, civil partnership or adoption,
you will have to supply documentary evidence that you have been continually
using the name for at least 2 years. If the name you are known by is the Irish
version of your name but you do not have proof of 2 years’ usage, proof of at
least 6 months’ usage may be accepted. If the proof of 6 months’ usage is
accepted, the English version of your name will also be noted on the passport.
Examples of documentation showing proof of usage include a driving licence,
bank statements, insurance, tax and social welfare documents. You should
include at least 2 examples with your application.</p>

<p>If the name on your passport will not be exactly the same as the name on
your birth certificate, you can indicate on the application form that you also
want your birth certificate name noted on the passport. This can help to avoid
difficulties if you apply for a visa or work permit abroad.</p>

<h3>Passport photographs</h3>

<p>Four recent identical photographs of the passport holder must be included
with each application. Two of these should be signed on the back by the <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/passports-citizenship/top-passport-questions/how-to-get-your-application-witnessed/">person
who witnesses the application</a>. The witness should also write the form
number shown in Section 9 of the application form on those two photographs. If
you are applying in Ireland the witness must be a member of the Garda
Síochána. </p>

<p>If you are applying abroad, suitable categories of witness are listed on the
application form. The witness should enter their daytime contact number on the
application form as this may need to be verified by the Passport Service or
Mission. </p>

<p>More <a shape="rect" href="https://www.dfa.ie/passports-citizenship/top-passport-questions/photo-guidelines/">detailed
information on passport photographs is available here</a>. </p>

<h3>Lost or stolen Irish passports</h3>

<p>You can now apply online to replace your passport. First, you will need to
report the loss or theft to the Garda Síochána (or to the local police if
abroad). You can view more detailed information in our document on <a href="replacing_a_lost_or_stolen_irish_passport.html">how to replace a lost
or stolen Irish passport</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>It is <em>not</em> possible to apply for your first Irish passport online.
(However, you can <a href="renewing_an_irish_passport.html">renew your
passport</a> online.) </p>

<p>It is also <em>not</em> currently possible to download the passport
application form. </p>

<p>If you are living in Ireland you can apply using <a href="http://www.anpost.ie/AnPost/MainContent/Personal+Customers/Sending+Mail/Speed/Passport+Express/">Passport
Express</a> or in person at a Passport Office. If you are living abroad you can
apply in person or using ordinary or registered post to your nearest Irish
embassy or consulate.</p>

<p>If you are an <strong>Irish citizen living in the State</strong>, you should
fill out form APS 1. You will find these forms at Garda stations and at any
Post Office. </p>

<p>If you are an <strong>Irish citizen living in Northern Ireland or outside
Ireland</strong> you should fill out form APS 2. You can get the application
form from the <a shape="rect" href="https://www.dfa.ie/embassies/irish-embassies-abroad/">Irish embassy or
consulate</a> in the country where you live (or the closest embassy or
consulate). The Passport Express service including forms is available through
<a href="https://www.dfa.ie/media/dfa/howtogetapassportpdfs/nipx-list-16-nov-07-for-website.pdf">certain
UK Post Office branches in Northern Ireland (pdf)</a>. </p>

<p>When you get the form, you should read the detailed notes provided with it,
to help you complete the application form correctly. The application form must
be signed by an official witness who can confirm your identity and the details
you have given.</p>

<h3>Documentation required</h3>

<p>In all applications for a new passport, as well as the completed application
form, you must submit:</p>
<ul><li>Four passport photographs, 2 of which must be signed by a witness as per
    instructions provided with the application form</li>
  <li>Certified copy of photographic ID, for example, driving licence, college
    identification card, passport from another country (The application form
    witness can certify it)</li>
  <li>Proof of use of name, for example, payslip, bank statement, social

resident in the State have to supply a photocopy of their <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/public_services_card.html">Public

passport applicants whose last passport was issued prior to January 2005 and
has since been reported as lost, stolen or damaged. They no longer need to
supply a certified copy of photographic ID or proof of use of name. Proof of
address continues to be required.</p>

<p>If your previous passport was issued to you when you were a child and has
not yet expired (or has only recently expired), your application is considered
a <a href="renewing_an_irish_passport.html">renewal application</a> and not
a first-time application.</p>

<h4>Additional documentation</h4>

<p>The additional documentation you must supply depends on how you obtained
your Irish citizenship. If you are replacing a lost, stolen or damaged passport

<h3>Processing times for passports</h3>

<p>The Passport Service strongly recommends that you apply for your passport at
least 6 weeks prior to your travel date.</p>

<p>Applying through the Passport Express service ensures that properly
completed renewal applications will normally be processed in 15 working days.
For first-time applications you should allow at least 20 working days for your
application to be processed. This period may be extended at certain times of
the year due to increased application numbers. Check the <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=83334">Passport Service website</a>
for current processing time information.</p>

<p>If you are due to travel in less than 3 weeks you should apply in person to
a Passport Office. To apply in person at a Passport Office, you should <a href="https://www.passportappointments.ie/">book an appointment online</a>. </p>

<p>If you require a passport urgently, you should contact the Passport Service.
</p>

<p>If living abroad, in general you should allow at least 6-8 weeks for the
processing of your passport via your local embassy or consulate.</p>

<h3>Tracking the progress of your passport application </h3>

<p>The Passport Service provides a <a shape="rect" href="https://www.dfa.ie/passports-citizenship/track-your-passport/">Passport
Tracking Service</a>. This service allows you to check the status of your
application online. In order to do this, you must have the application number
from your form (available in the top left-hand corner of the form) to do
this.</p>

<h3>Signing the passport</h3>

<p>When you receive your passport, you should sign it. In the case of a
child’s passport, the child should sign it. If the child is not able to sign
their name, it should be left blank.</p>

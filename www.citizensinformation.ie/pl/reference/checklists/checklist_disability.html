<p>The lists and links below are to help you to check out all the main services
and entitlements for people with disabilities. The focus is on adults with a
long-term illness or disability likely to last at least one year. </p>

<div>
document.write("If you would like these links to remain available while you browse this website, you can <a href='#' class='secNavLink' data='entitlements_disability'>'pin' the checklist to the right-hand side of the website</a>. It will remain in place until you click the 'X' in the top right-hand corner.");</script></p>
</div>

<p>The headings in the left hand column of each section link to general
documents on the subject, and those in the right hand column link to details of
specific payments or services.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/services/advocacy_services/">National
Advocacy Service (NAS)</a> provides independent, confidential and free advocacy
for people with disabilities - in particular people who are isolated from their
community and services, have communication differences, are inappropriately
accommodated, live in residential services or attend day services and have
limited supports. The service is funded and supported by the <a href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/">Citizens Information Board</a>.
You can find contact details for advocates through the Citizens Information <a href="http://findaddress.citizensinformation.ie/service_finder/">Find an
Address service</a>. </p>

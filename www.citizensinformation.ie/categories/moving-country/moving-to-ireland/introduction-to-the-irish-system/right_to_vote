<div class="topic">

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you have applied and been approved for Irish citizenship, you have the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/elections_and_referenda/voting/">right to vote</a>
in all <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/elections_and_referenda/referenda/referenda_introduction.html">referenda</a>
and <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/elections_and_referenda/national_elections/the_general_election.html">elections</a>
in Ireland. In order however to exercise that right, you must ensure that your
name has been entered on the Electoral Register. </p>

<p>If you are resident in Ireland but not an Irish citizen, you also have the
right to vote in some of the elections. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lbaae0">The Electoral Register</h2>

<p>Every local authority is responsible for compiling and publishing a list of
voters in its area. This is called the Register of Electors or the Electoral
Register. Anyone can inspect this Register and it is available in all <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local
authority offices,</a> post offices, Garda stations and public libraries. You
can <a href="http://www.checktheregister.ie/">check the Electoral Register
online here</a>.</p>

<p>The published Register contains the voter's name, address, polling station
and category of voter. For inclusion in the Register of Electors you must
complete application form <a href="http://www.checktheregister.ie/PublicPages/AppForms.aspx">RFA</a> which
is available from your local authority, to whom it must be returned.</p>

<p>A new Electoral Register is compiled each year and is published on 1
November. Resident Irish citizens are entitled to vote at all elections.
Resident British citizens can vote in local, European and Dáil elections and
are identified by the letter 'D' in their details in the Register. Resident EU
citizens can only vote in local and European elections and are identified by
the letter 'E'. Those identified by the letter 'L' (non-EU citizens) can only
vote at local elections. </p>

<h3>Correcting your details in the draft Register</h3>

<p>A draft register is compiled on 1 November each year. You have until 25
November to make a correction or have your name included. You must fill in form
<a href="http://www.checktheregister.ie/PublicPages/AppForms.aspx">RFA1</a> for
the draft Register.You may be asked for documents such as a birth certificate
or a certificate of naturalisation in order to prove your eligibility to vote.
If you are applying because you have moved to a new address, you should include
this information and your former address so that you can be removed from the
register for that area. The amended register is then published in February. </p>

<h3>Supplement to the Register</h3>

<p>If you are qualified to vote but have missed the deadline to include your
name on the register, you can apply to be included in a Supplement to the
Register on <a href="http://www.checktheregister.ie/PublicPages/AppForms.aspx">form
RFA2</a><strong>.</strong> This will allow you to vote at any election or
referendum held during the year. You can apply for inclusion on the
Supplemental Register at least 15 days before polling day (Sundays, public
holidays and Good Friday are not counted as days for this purpose). </p>

<p>You are eligible for inclusion in the supplement to the Register of Electors
on or after the day on which you reach 18 years of age. You can be included if
this birthday falls after the closing date for applications but is on or before
polling day. </p>
</div>

<p>You can apply for inclusion on the supplement as a result of changing
address on <a href="http://www.checktheregister.ie/PublicPages/AppForms.aspx">form RFA3.</a>
This will also remove you from the register for your previous address. <br></p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l862a3">Who can vote in elections and referenda?</h2>

<p>You must be at least 18 years of age on 15 February, the day the Register
comes into force. You must also have been ordinarily resident in the State on 1
September in the year before the Register comes into force. </p>

<p>While you may be entitled to register as a voter due to your residency,
there may be a limit on the types of elections in which you can vote. The
registration authority will need to know your citizenship because this will
determine the elections at which you may vote. </p>

<p>The right to vote is as follows: </p>
<ul><li><span>Irish citizens</span> may vote at every election and referendum;
  </li>
  <li><span>British citizens</span> may vote at Dáil elections, <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/elections_and_referenda/european_elections/european_elections.html">European
    elections</a> and <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/elections_and_referenda/local_elections/local_elections.html">local
    elections</a>; </li>
  <li><span>Other European Union (EU) citizens</span> may vote at European and
    local elections* </li>
  <li><span>Non-EU citizens</span> may vote at local elections only. </li>
</ul><p>*If you are an EU citizen, other than an Irish or British citizen, and you
were not registered to vote in previous European elections in Ireland, you must
also complete a declaration, <a href="http://www.meath.ie/CountyCouncil/ElectionsVotingInformation/ElectoralRegister/ElectoralRegisterForms/File,56069,en.pdf">Form
EP1 (pdf)</a>, to guard against double voting in the election. The local
council will register you to vote in your local constituency and send the
information in your declaration to your home EU Member State. You can also get
the form from your local authority.</p>

<p>You must be registered at one address only and you must live at that address
on 1 September before the register comes into force. If you live away from the
address at which you are registered, (for example, if you are a student living
away from home), you will need to contact the registration authority and give
them your new address. </p>

<p>If you leave your address but you plan to return there within 18 months, you
can continue to be registered there, as long you do not register at any other
address. </p>

<h3>Overseas voters</h3>

<p>If you are an Irish citizen living abroad you cannot be entered on the
register of electors. This means that you cannot vote in an election or
referendum here in Ireland. (The only exception to this is in the case of Irish
officials on duty abroad (and their spouses) who may register on the postal
voters list). </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l2c069">Postal voters</h2>

<p>You will normally be required to vote in person at an official voting
centre, however, you may be eligible for a postal vote if you are:</p>
<ul><li>A full-time member of the Defence Force</li>
  <li>A member of the Garda Siochana</li>
  <li>An Irish diplomat or his/her spouse posted abroad </li>
</ul><p>You may also be eligible for a postal vote if you cannot go to a polling
station because:</p>
<ul><li>You have a <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/elections_and_referenda/voting/facilities_for_voters_with_disabilities.html">physical
    illness or disability</a></li>
  <li>You are studying full time at an educational institution in Ireland,
    which is away from your home address where you are registered. </li>
  <li>You are unable to vote at your polling station because of your occupation
  </li>
  <li>You are unable to vote at your polling station because you are in prison
    as a result of an order of a court. </li>
</ul><p>Applications for inclusion on the list of postal voters must be received by
25 November at the latest. If you are registered as a postal voter, you may
vote by post only. You may not vote at a polling station.</p>

<p>You may also qualify to be on a list of special voters who live in
hospitals, nursing homes or similar institutions and who wish to vote at these
locations. Applications to be entered on the special voters list must be made
by 25 November and, in the case of a first application, must be accompanied by
a medical certificate. </p>

<p>If you are eligible for the postal voters list or the special voters list
but are not included, you can apply for inclusion in the relevant
<strong>supplement to the lists</strong>. The latest date for receipt of
applications is two days after the date of dissolution of the Dáil in the case
of a general election or two days after the order appointing polling day for
other elections or referenda. You can find out more in our document on <a href="../../../government_in_ireland/elections_and_referenda/voting/registering_to_vote.html">registering
to vote</a>.</p>

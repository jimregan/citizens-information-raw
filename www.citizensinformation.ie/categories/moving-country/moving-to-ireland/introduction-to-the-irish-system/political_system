<p>The <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Irish
Constitution</a> (known in Ireland as Bunreacht na hEireann or 'Basic Law of
Ireland') is the fundamental legal document that sets down how Ireland should
be governed. It establishes for example, the Head of State, branches of
government, the courts and it also sets out how those institutions should be
run. The Constitution has another important function; it describes the
fundamental rights that every Irish citizen is entitled to. </p>

<h3>The Oireachtas (the Irish Parliament)</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/dail_eireann.html">Dail</a>
and <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/the_seanad.html">Seanad</a>
(Senate) are collectively known as the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Government
is chosen by and is collectively responsible to the Dail. There must be a
minimum of 7 and a maximum of 15 Ministers (<a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/the_irish_government/composition_of_the_government.html">Members
of the Government</a>), in practice there are almost always 15 Ministers. The
<a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/the_irish_government/the_taoiseach.html">Taoiseach</a>,
the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/the_irish_government/the_tanaiste.html">Tanaiste</a>
and the Minister for Finance must be Members of the Dail. It is possible to
have 2 Ministers who are members of the Senate but this rarely happens. At
present, there are 15 Ministers of State. </p>

<p>The Government's main functions are to propose legislation, manage the
public finances and <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/government_departments/administration_of_government_departments.html">administer
the government departments</a>.</p>

<p>The Government is responsible to the Dail. It is not responsible to the
Senate. However, Ministers have a right to attend the Senate and it is normal
practice for the relevant Minister or Minister of State to be present when the
House is dealing with their areas of responsibility.</p>

<h3>Committees</h3>

<p>Much of the work of the Dail and Senate is now done in Committees. Each
House may form Committees for particular purposes. Select Committees have the
power to take oral and written evidence and seek documents. The Committees of
the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of
Witnesses) Act 1997 deals with the powers of the Committees. Joint Committees
are Select Committees of each House sitting and voting together. Special
Committees do not have the same powers as Select Committees.</p>

<p>Ministers may be ex officio members of Committees. Ministers meet with the
Committees at the committee stage of Bills and when the Committee is discussing
an issue within the Minister's area or the Estimates for the Department. Irish
MEPs (and Northern Ireland MEPs) and members of the Irish delegation to the
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe may attend and participate at
meetings of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Joint Committee on
European Affairs but may not vote.</p>

<p>In general, Committees deal with Estimates of Expenditure, Committee Stages
of Bills relevant to their terms of reference and related reports. It is common
for Committees to invite voluntary and community organisations and/ or experts
to make submissions to them on various issues and it is also common for such
organisations to ask to make a submission.</p>

<h3>Controlling the public finances </h3>

<p>Each year, the Government prepares the Estimates of the Receipts and
Expenditure of the State. This is an outline of the costs of running each
Department and Office of State. The Estimates are published before the annual
Budget. The Dail and the relevant Committees debate the Estimates in detail.
The Estimates are passed by the Dail and are given statutory effect by the
Appropriation Act. The Budget is given immediate legal effect by financial
resolutions of the Dail on the evening of the Budget speech. The Finance Act
must be passed within four months of the Budget.</p>

<p>At present, budgeting is on an annual basis. Proposals for multi-annual
budgets are being considered. You can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.budget.gov.ie/">view the full text of Ireland's Budget
here</a>.</p>

<p>Each <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/government_departments/departments_of_state.html">government
department</a> and office has an accounting officer (the Secretary General of
the Department or the head of other offices) who is responsible to the Minister
and to the Dail Public Accounts Committee.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/comptroller_and_auditor_general.html">Comptroller
and Auditor General</a> is appointed under <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">the
Constitution</a> to control on behalf of the State all disbursements and to
audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the
Oireachtas. The Comptroller's functions are set out in legislation.</p>

<h3>Legislation</h3>

<p>It is almost always the Government of the day who propose new laws. A
Minister presents a <em>Bill</em> to the Dail or Seanad for discussion and
decision. A <em>Bill</em> is proposed legislation - after it is passed and
signed by the President, it is called an <em>Act.</em> Occasionally, a TD or
Senator presents what is called a Private Member's Bill. It is very rare for
such a Bill to get beyond the first stage - the reasons for this are political
rather than legal. However, some important legislation in recent years has
resulted from Private Members' Bills - notably The Judicial Separation and
Family Law Reform Act 1989. The procedure is the same whether the Bill is
proposed by the Government or by a Member.</p>

<p>Usually, a Bill is presented by a Minister to the Dail. Occasionally the
process is started in the Seanad but any Bills dealing with taxation or related
matters must start in the Dail. Each Bill has to go through a number of
<em>stages</em> or <em>readings</em>. It can be defeated at any of these stages
and, if this happens in the Dail, the process ends there. The Seanad can only
obstruct a Bill. In practice, Government Bills are not often defeated. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/acts.html">text of all Irish
legislation</a> from the foundation of the State to 2005 is available
online.</p>

<h3>The stages</h3>

<p>The first stage or reading just involves presenting the title of the Bill to
the Dail (or Seanad). In effect, that just allows the Bill to be printed. The
Bill is then circulated to all TDs (or Senators) and there is a second reading.
At this second stage the Minister who is presenting the Bill explains what it
is all about. A number of speakers from the Opposition indicate their opinion
and there is a general discussion of the Bill. The next stage is called the
Committee stage. The Bill is analysed in detail at this stage and amendments
may be put down either by the Government or the Opposition. The
<em>Committee</em> may be selected members of the Dail or it may be the full
house. (See below for more detailed description of Committees). The fourth
stage - sometimes called the report stage - involves an overall discussion and
again, amendments may be put down and voted upon. The next stage involves
sending the Bill to the other House (the Seanad usually) where a similar
procedure is followed.</p>

<p>The Seanad cannot amend or defeat a money Bill. It can amend and delay other
Bills.</p>

<p>When the Bill is passed by both the Dail and Seanad it is sent to the
President for signature. The Bill is now an Act. It may become law immediately
after the President signs or there may be a clause or clauses in it which
specify when it will come into effect. For example, some Acts contain a
provision that they will come into effect within, say, one month of being
signed. Sections may come into effect at different times. Sometimes there can
be a very long delay in bringing sections into effect.</p>

<h3>Subordinate legislation</h3>

<p>Subordinate legislation is a lesser form of legislation than Acts. The most
common is a Statutory Instrument (SI). There must be specific power laid down
in an Act in order to allow a Statutory Instrument to be effective. Usually an
Act authorises a Minister to make Regulations dealing with details. The Act
itself sets out the general law. The Statutory Instrument cannot deviate in any
way from what is laid down in the Act - if they do, they are what is called
<em>ultra vires</em>. That means "beyond the powers" - that is, the Minister
does not have the power to do what he is purporting to do.</p>

<p>There are dozens of Statutory Instruments dealing with social welfare -
there are probably more on that subject than any other. The Social Welfare Acts
set out the broad principles and the Statutory Instruments outline the detailed
requirements.</p>

<p>Statutory Instruments do not usually have to be passed by the Oireachtas.
The usual procedure is that the SI is put before the Dail. It is then
effective. It may be annulled within 21 days - in practice, they rarely are.
(Sometimes the original Act requires that Statutory Instruments be put before
the Dail before they come into effect.)</p>

<p>Apart from Ministers, certain other bodies, mainly regulatory bodies, have
the power to make subordinate legislation. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.comreg.ie">Commission for Telecommunications Regulation
(ComReg)</a>, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.lawsociety.ie">Incorporated
Law Society</a> and Joint Labour Committees are among the bodies with such
powers.</p>

<h3>The Role of Ministers</h3>

<p>The precise role of Ministers is specified in the Constitution and in
legislation. The <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/government_departments/the_civil_service.html">role
of civil servants</a> is set out in legislation and is also governed by
administrative decisions and management strategies. The main legislation
relating to the roles of Ministers and civil servants is contained in the
Ministers and Secretaries Acts 1924-1995, the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956
and the legislation relating to the Comptroller and Auditor General (see
above). The Public Service Management (No. 2) Act 1997, which came into effect
in September 1997, is an important new piece of legislation in this area.</p>

<p>Under the Constitution, Departments of State are administered by members of
the Government (Ministers) and the Minister is in charge of the Department.
This means that final responsibility rests with the Minister but many of the
functions of the Department and responsibility for various actions are assigned
to civil servants.</p>

<h3>Policy Making</h3>

<h3>Green Papers/White Papers/Discussion documents </h3>

<p>There is no significance in the colours or even in the titles. The theory of
the Green Paper/ White Paper process of policy making is thus: a Green Paper is
a discussion document, usually written by civil servants, in which an issue is
outlined, various options are suggested and the advantages and disadvantages of
those options may be set out. Generally, the public is asked for submissions on
the options proposed. After this process is complete, a White Paper is drawn up
- this sets out the Government's policy on the issue and what it intends to do.
The proposals in the White Paper are then implemented.</p>

<p>In practice, this sometimes happens but there are many variations. Sometimes
this process occurs but the titles Green and White Papers are not used; they
are called discussion documents or something similar. Sometimes a White Paper
is published without a preceding Green Paper. Sometimes the process is carried
through and then nothing happens after the White Paper is published. Sometimes
papers are published which have the same effect as a White Paper but are called
strategy documents or similar. The actual public consultation process varies as
well.</p>

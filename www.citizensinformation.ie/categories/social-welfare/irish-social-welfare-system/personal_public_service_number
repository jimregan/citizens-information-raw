<p>Your Personal Public Service Number (<acronym title="Personal Public Service Number">PPS number</acronym>) is a unique
reference number that helps you access social welfare benefits, public services
and information in Ireland. </p>

<p>Before you can be allocated a PPS number, you must show that you need one
for <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Personal-Public-Service-Number-Register-of-Users.aspx">a
transaction with a specified body</a>. For example, if you are taking up
employment, you need a PPS number to register with the Revenue Commissioners.
However, looking for work is not a transaction with a specified body and <a href="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014120900077?opendocument#WRB01850">employers
should not look for your PPS number when recruiting</a>. An employer should
only seek a PPS number if you are actually taking up employment with the
organisation. </p>

<p>State agencies that use PPS numbers to identify individuals include the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie">Department of Social Protection</a>,
the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie">Revenue Commissioners</a> and
the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hse.ie/">Health Service Executive
(HSE)</a>. </p>

<p>A PPS number is always 7 numbers followed by either one or two letters. </p>

<p>The PPS number was known as the Revenue and Social Insurance (<acronym title="Revenue and Social Insurance">RSI</acronym>) number. If your number is
the same as your spouse's number but your number has a W at the end, you may
need a new PPS number - see <strong>'Phasing out of</strong> <strong>W
numbers'</strong> below for more information.</p>

<h3>Changes to PPS numbers</h3>

<p>The Department of Social Protection (DSP) is extending the current stock of
PPS numbers. The extension was necessary because of the exhaustion of the
remaining stock of usable numbers.</p>

<p>The format of the new numbers is 9 characters: 7 numbers followed by 2
letters. For individuals, the second letter in the new PPS number will be 'A'
(for example, 1234567FA) and for non-individual cases, such as limited
companies, trusts, partnerships and unincorporated bodies, it will be 'H' (for
example, 1234567WH).</p>

<p>The DSP started issuing the new format PPS numbers (for individuals) in the
first quarter of 2013. All companies, trusts, partnerships and unincorporated
bodies newly registered after 1 January 2013 are assigned the new format
number. </p>

<p>Existing PPS numbers and Tax Registration numbers remain unchanged and
continue to be valid.</p>

<h3>Using the Personal Public Service Number </h3>

<p>You can use your PPS number for:</p>
<ul><li>All social welfare services </li>
  <li>The <a shape="rect" href="../payments/extra_social_welfare_benefits/free_travel.html">Free
    Travel Pass</a> </li>

    card</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/drugs_payment_scheme.html">Drugs
    Payment Scheme</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/health/children_s_health/immunisations_for_children.html">Child
    immunisation</a> </li>
  <li>Schemes run by the Revenue Commissioners, such as <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/owning_a_home/buying_a_home/mortgage_interest_relief.html">mortgage

  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/housing_grants_and_schemes/">Housing

    Theory Testing</a> and <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/driver_licensing/full_driving_licence.html">driver
    licences</a> </li>
</ul><p>A <acronym title="Personal Public Service Number">PPS n</acronym>umber has
already been issued to you if:</p>
<ul><li>You were born in Ireland in or after 1971 </li>
  <li>You started work in Ireland after 1979 </li>
  <li>You are getting a social welfare payment </li>
  <li>You are taking part in the Drugs Payment Scheme </li>
</ul><p>PPS numbers are printed on the following documents:</p>
<ul><li><a href="public_services_card.html">Public Services Card</a></li>
  <li>Social Services Card </li>
  <li>Drugs Payment Card </li>
  <li>P60 (the annual statement of pay, tax and social insurance contributions
    from your employer) </li>
  <li>P45 (the statement of tax and pay to date issued by your employer when
    you leave employment) </li>
  <li>Tax Assessment </li>
  <li>PAYE Notice of Tax Credits </li>
  <li>Temporary Payment Card </li>
</ul><h3>Phasing out of W numbers</h3>

<p>Before 2000 when some women got married they had to use the same PPS number
as their husband, but with a W at the end of the number. This W number was
issued by Revenue to identify spouses in a jointly assessed relationship. The W
number was linked to the PPS number of the assessable spouse (which is the term
used in Revenue for the spouse who is charged tax on the income of both
spouses). </p>

<p>These numbers are being slowly phased out and W numbers have not been issued
since 1999. </p>

<p>If your PPS number is the same as your husband’s PPS number but the last
letter is W, you must get a new PPS number in these circumstances:</p>
<ul><li>If your spouse is deceased</li>
  <li>If you are divorced or separated</li>
  <li>If you were issued with a Social Insurance number before 1979</li>
</ul><p>If you have a PPS number ending with W and <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/lpt/lpt-paye-w.html">you cannot access the
Local Property Tax online system</a> using this number you may need to request
a new number. </p>

<p>If you were issued a PPS number after 1979 and before you married, the
Department may re-issue you with your original number on request. </p>

<p>If you are changing your W number for a new PPS number you do not need to go
through the same application process as everyone else. To get your new number
or to be re-instated with your old number contact the Client Identity Section
in the Department of Social Protection. The phone number is 1890 927 999 or
(071) 967 2616.</p>

<p>When you get your new number from the Department of Social Protection you
should inform any organisations that may hold your old number. For example,
your employer, your bank, the National Driver Licence Service, the HSE and
Revenue – you can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/forms/form12a.pdf">inform Revenue of your
new PPS Number using Form 12A (pdf).</a></p>

<h3>I'm moving to Ireland soon - how do I get a Personal Public Service
Number?</h3>

<p>You <span>cannot </span>apply for a PPS number before you arrrive in
Ireland. You <span>must be living in Ireland</span> to apply for a PPS number.
Before you can be allocated a PPS number, you must show that <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Personal-Public-Service-Number-Register-of-Users.aspx">one
is required for a transaction with a specified body.</a></p>

<p>You will be asked to produce documentary evidence of identity and residence
in Ireland. Different documentary evidence will be required, depending on your
nationality. A <a shape="rect" href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Personal-Public-Service-Number-How-to-Apply.aspx">complete
list of documents required as evidence of your identity is available</a>. </p>
</div>

<h3>I am not resident in Ireland but I need a PPS number - how do I get it?
</h3>

<p>In some cases people who are not resident in Ireland may need a PPS number.
For example, someone who is a beneficiary under an Irish will may need to
supply a PPS number before a grant of probate can issue. </p>

<p>The Department of Social Protection's Client Identity Services (CIS) provide
a service for non-resident applicants who cannot attend at a designated PPS
Registration Centre and who need a PPS number. If you want to use this service,
you must show documentary evidence that you need a PPS number for a transaction
with a specified body. You cannot use this exceptional application process if
you are living in or intend to relocate to Ireland for any period of time.
Audits of PPS applications are carried out periodically and you may be asked
for additional information. </p>

<p>If you are living in Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom and are working
in the Republic of Ireland (a frontier worker) you apply for a PPS number in
the normal way at a designated <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Personal-Public-Service-Number-Registration-Centres-by-Count.aspx">PPS
Registration Centre</a>. </p>

<h3>I need a PPS number for a deceased person - how do I get this?</h3>

<p>Occasionally a PPS number may be required for a deceased person, usually
when dealing with grant of probate.</p>

<p>In such cases, you should send a copy of the death certificate and details
about why the PPS number is required to the Department of Social Protection's
Client Identity Services - the address is below.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To get a PPS number, you will need to fill out an application form in the
PPS number centre, provide evidence of your identity and evidence of why you
need a PPS number allocated. You must also provide proof of your address. </p>

<p></p>

      <td>Current passport or national identity card</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Non-EU citizens</td>
      <td>Current passport </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><h3>Evidence of your address</h3>

<p>You need to show evidence of your address. You can use any of the following
documents to do this (it must show your name and address):</p>
<ul><li>A household utility bill</li>
  <li>An official letter/document</li>
  <li>A financial statement</li>
  <li>Property lease or tenancy agreement,</li>
  <li>Verifiable employer's letter*</li>
  <li>Confirmation of address by a third party such as a school
    principal/administrator, accommodation/property owner**or manager.</li>
</ul><p>*Your employer does not need to own or provide the accommodation. </p>

<p>**If you are staying with friends or relatives an original household bill
plus a note from the bill holder confirming your residency at the bill address
is acceptable. This note can be written on the bill itself.</p>

<h3>Child applications</h3>

<p>Children born in Ireland are usually given a Personal Public Service Number
(PPS number) when their birth is registered with the General Register Office
(GRO). This means you do not need to apply for a PPS number for an Irish-born
child.</p>

<p>However a PPS number is not automatically allocated if both parents'
addresses are outside of the State. If you need a PPS number in such a case
then you must apply at a PPS number allocation centre.</p>

<p>PPS numbers for children living in, but not born in Ireland, must be applied
for by the parent/guardian. One of the parents/guardians must have a PPS number
for the child to be registered and linked with their data.</p>

<p>The parent, foster parent, guardian, or school representative should attend
with the child, and provide evidence of his/her own identity, the identity of
the child, evidence of the requirement for a PPS number, and evidence of the
relationship between the parent/guardian and the child. Evidence of address
should also be provided. The Department of Social Protection may make further
enquiries where it is considered necessary to confirm the relationship between
the child and the person requesting a PPS number.</p>

<p>A person aged less than 16 years is considered to be a child for PPS number
allocation purposes.</p>

<h3>PPS number fraud control</h3>

<p>The Department of Social Protection monitors identity fraud issues, helps to
draw up procedures for processing applications and investigates suspect
documents. Staff in social welfare offices are required to check the
authenticity of supporting documents and refer doubtful cases for checking by
document fraud experts. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>Only the Department of Social Protection can provide you with a Personal
Public Service Number (PPS number) . You can find <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Personal-Public-Service-Number-Registration-Centres-by-Count.aspx">a
list of the social welfare local offices that can register PPS numbers on the
Department of Social Protection's website</a>. Please note that some offices
operate an appointment only system. You should contact the office to check if
an appointment is required. A Public Services Card is usually issued when you
are allocated a PPS number. This means that you will also have your photograph
taken when you attend an office for registration of a new PPS number. It will
take approximately 4-5 days for notification of your PPS number to arrive after
your appointment.</p>

<h3>Online appointments</h3>

<p>If you want to get a PPS number or to be registered for a Public Services
Card, you can now make <a href="https://www.mywelfare.ie/Account/Login">an
appointment online at mywelfare.ie</a>. </p>

<p>You will first need to register with the site. To do this you need a mobile
phone number and two email addresses (a main address and an alternate address).
</p>

<p>When you have made your appointment, print the notification and bring it to
your appointment along with the required documents (listed in the
notification). </p>

<p><a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/PPS-Online-Registration-Centres.aspx">You
can access a list of PPS online registration centres on welfare.ie.</a></p>

<p></p>

<p>If you do not know your <acronym title="Personal Public Service Number">PPS</acronym> number, contact your <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/List-of-Social-Welfare-Local-and-Branch-Offices-by-County.aspx">Intreo
centre or social welfare local office</a> and staff there can find your number
for you. </p>

<p>If you are unsure as to whether a particular organisation, person or agent
is entitled to request or use your <acronym title="Personal Public Service Number">PPS</acronym> number, you should contact
Client Identity Services in the Department of Social Protection. You can <a shape="rect" href="https://www.welfare.ie/EN/Secure/Pages/CISGeneralEnquiry.aspx">contact

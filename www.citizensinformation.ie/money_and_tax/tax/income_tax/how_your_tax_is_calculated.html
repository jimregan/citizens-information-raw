<p>Nearly all income is liable to tax. Tax on income that you earn from
employment is deducted from your wages by your employer on behalf of the Irish
Government. This is known as Pay As You Earn (PAYE). The amount of tax that you
have to pay depends on the amount of the income that you earn and on your
personal circumstances. There are a range of <a shape="rect" href="credits_and_reliefs/">income tax reliefs</a> available that can reduce
the amount of tax that you have to pay.</p>

<p>The Universal Social Charge (USC) is a tax on your income. It is charged on
your <strong>gross income</strong> before any pension contributions or <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">PRSI</a>.
You cannot use tax credits or tax relief (except for certain capital
allowances) to reduce the amount you must pay. Find out more in our document on
the <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">Universal
Social Charge</a>.</p>

<h2>Notice of determination of tax credits and standard rate cut-off point</h2>

<p>At the start of the tax year, the Revenue Commissioners will send you a
Notice of determination of tax credits and standard rate cut-off point. This
shows the rate of tax that applies to your income and the tax credits that
reduce the tax payable. Revenue will also send a summary of this certificate to
your employer so that your employer can deduct the correct amount of tax. If
your circumstances change during the year Revenue will issue a revised
certificate. </p>

<p>If you are changing job or starting work for the first time, and your
employer has not received this information from Revenue or a previous employer,
you will be taxed on a temporary basis called emergency tax. You can get more
information about <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/starting_work_and_changing_job/starting_work/tax_and_starting_work.html">tax
and starting work</a> or <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/starting_work_and_changing_job/changing_job/change_job_tax_prsi.html">changing

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l2729c">Tax rates and the standard rate cut-off
point</h2>

<p>Tax is charged as a percentage of your income. The percentage that you pay
depends on the amount of your income. The first part of your income, up to a
certain amount, is taxed at 20%. This is known as the <em>standard rate of
tax</em> and the amount that it applies to is known as the <em>standard rate
tax band</em>. </p>

<p>The remainder of your income is taxed at the <em>higher rate of tax</em>,
40% in 2017.</p>

<p>The amount that you can earn before you start to pay the higher rate of tax
is known as your <em>standard rate cut-off point</em>. See <a shape="rect" href="../../../reference/case_studies/case_study_calculating_your_income_tax_case_studies.html">case
studies</a> for an example of how to calculate income using tax rates and the
standard rate cut-off point.</p>

partners with two incomes</h4>

<p>In 2017, the standard rate cut-off point for a married couple or civil
partners is €42,800. If both are working, this amount is increased by the
lower of the following:</p>
<ul><li>€24,800 <strong>or</strong></li>
  <li>The amount of the income of the spouse or civil partner with the smaller
    income</li>
</ul><p>If one person is earning €48,000 and their spouse or civil partner is
earning €25,000:</p>

<p>The standard rate cut off point for the couple is €42,800 plus €24,800.
The increase in the standard rate band is not transferable between spouses or
civil partners, so the first spouse or civil partner's tax bands would be
calculated as €42,800 @ 20% = €8,560 and €5,200 @ 40% = €2,080. The
second spouse or civil partner's tax bands would be calculated as €24,800 @
20% = €4,960 and €200 @ 40% = €80. </p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l640ec">Tax credits </h2>

<p>Tax credits reduce the amount of tax that you have to pay. Tax credits are
deducted <em>after</em> your tax has been calculated and so a tax credit has
the same value to all taxpayers.</p>

<p>After your tax is calculated, as a percentage of your income, the tax credit
is deducted from this to reduce the amount of tax that you have to pay. So a
tax credit of €200, for example, will reduce your tax by that amount.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to various tax credits depending on your personal
circumstances. You can get more information about the <a shape="rect" href="credits_and_reliefs/">different types of tax credits and reliefs</a> and
the <a shape="rect" href="../tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/">tax reliefs
available for people with disabilities</a>. If you are entitled to tax credits
that are not listed on the <em>Notice of determination of tax credits and
standard rate cut-off point</em> that you get from Revenue, you should contact
Revenue to inform them.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l4289e">Tax allowances</h2>

<p>Tax allowances reduce the amount of tax that you have to pay. The amount by
which a tax allowance will reduce your tax depends on what your highest rate of
tax is. This is because the allowance is subtracted from your income before it
is taxed. In effect, it is ‘taken off the top’ of your income which can
then be taxed at either the standard rate or the higher rate, depending on your
income level.</p>

<p>If, for example, you have a tax allowance of €200 and your highest rate of
tax is 20%, then this means that the amount of your income that is taxed at
this rate is reduced by €200 and so your tax is reduced by €40 (€200 x
20%). </p>

<p>If you have the same tax allowance of €200 but the highest rate of tax
that you pay is 40%, then the amount of your income that is taxed at 40% is
reduced by €200 and so your tax reduction is €80 (€200 x 40%).<br>
This is known as tax allowance at the <em>marginal rate</em>.</p>

<p>When your employer is taking allowances into account in calculating your
income tax, the way that this is done is by adjusting your standard rate
cut-off point. </p>

<p>Allowances at the marginal rate include:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="../tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/tax_relief_for_employing_a_home_carer.html">Tax
    relief on employing a carer for an incapacitated person</a> </li>

</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l73021">Calculating your tax</h2>

<p>Before calculating your income tax, subtract the following from your
income:</p>
<ul><li>Pension contributions </li>
  <li>Payments to a Permanent Health Benefit Scheme (to a maximum of 10% of
    income). This is a policy that will ensure continued income in the event of
    an accident, injury or sickness. </li>
  <li>Tax allowances </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="credits_and_reliefs/employment_tax_credits_and_reliefs.html">Work
    expenses that were necessary to carry out your work duties</a>. </li>
</ul><p>Your taxable pay is then taxed at 20% of income below the standard rate
cut-off point. The amount in excess of the cut-off point is taxed at 40%. This
gives your Gross Tax.</p>

<p>The value of your tax credits is then subtracted from this to give the
amount of tax that you have to pay.</p>

<h2>Factors affecting the standard rate cut off point</h2>

<p>The standard rate cut off point may vary according to your personal
circumstances. You may be entitled to tax allowances that will raise your
standard rate cut off point. Alternatively, your standard rate cut-off point
could be lowered. This could arise, for example, if most of your income is from
your employer but you also have income outside this from which tax has not been
deducted. </p>

<p><strong>Tax allowances</strong> have the effect of:</p>
<ul><li>Increasing tax credits by the amount of the relief at the standard rate
    of tax. This grants relief at the standard rate of tax. 
    <p><em>and </em></p>
  </li>
  <li>Increasing the standard rate band by the amount of the relief. This adds
    the difference between relief at the higher rate of tax and the standard
    rate of tax.</li>
</ul><p>This ensures that relief is obtained in full at the higher rate of tax if
applicable.</p>

<p>For example, a tax allowance of €1,000 would have a value of €200 to a
taxpayer on the standard rate and a value of €400 to a taxpayer on the higher
rate. The way this is calculated is to increase tax credits by €200 (1,000 x
20% standard rate of tax). This is the amount of the benefit to a standard rate
taxpayer but the tax allowance would have a higher value for a taxpayer paying
tax at the higher rate. This is achieved by increasing the standard rate
cut-off point by €1,000. This means that for a higher rate taxpayer, €1,000
that would be taxed at a rate of 40% is instead taxed at 20%, a saving of
€200 (€400 – 200 ) in addition to the €200 saved by the increase in tax
credits. The increase in the standard rate cut-off point would not effect a
taxpayer already paying tax only at the standard rate so he/she would only
benefit from the increased tax credits.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits in kind and non-PAYE income</strong> have the opposite
effect:</p>
<ul><li>Decreasing tax credits by the amount of the income at the standard rate
    of tax 
    <p><em>and</em> </p>
  </li>
  <li>Decreasing the standard rate cut-off point by the amount of the
  income.</li>
</ul><p>This has the opposite effect to the example above. In this case, €1,000
would decrease the tax credits by €200, affecting both standard and higher
rate taxpayers. It would also decrease the standard rate cut-off point by
€1,000 having the effect of increasing the tax liability for higher rate
taxpayers only.</p>

<h2>Income that is assessed for tax</h2>

<p>Under the PAYE system, income tax is charged on all wages, fees, perks,
profits or pensions and most types of interest. Tax is payable on earnings of
all kinds that result from your employment (including for example, bonuses,
overtime, non-cash pay or 'benefit-in-kind' such as the use of company car,
tips, Christmas boxes and so forth). </p>

<p>Money you get which is not liable to income tax may be liable to other
taxes. If you get gifts or inheritances, you may have to pay <a shape="rect" href="../capital_taxes/capital_acquisitions_tax.html">Capital Acquisitions
Tax</a>. If you sell assets such as property or shares you may have to pay <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/cgt/leaflets/cgt2.html">Capital Gains
Tax</a>.</p>

<h2>Exemptions</h2>

<p>Income that may be exempt from tax includes the following:</p>
<ul><li>Payments to approved pension schemes </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/overview_redundancy.html">Statutory
    redundancy payments</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">Certain
    social welfare payments</a> </li>
  <li>Scholarship income </li>
  <li>Interest from savings certificates and Savings Bonds and National
    Instalment Savings Schemes, within limits </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="artists_exemption_from_income_tax.html">Certain
    earnings by artists</a> </li>
  <li>Certain payments in respect of disabilities linked with Thalidomide </li>
  <li>Wins from licensed lotteries </li>
  <li>Certain army pensions and allowances </li>
  <li>Payments made by the Health Service Executive to foster parents for the
    care of foster children </li>
  <li>Some compensation payments under employment law </li>
  <li>Compensation for personal injury that prevents an individual from
    maintaining herself. Income arising from the investment of such a payment
    is also exempt if it is the main source of income. Invalidity pension
    received as a result of the same injury is not included in assessing main
    income. </li>
</ul><p>If you are on low pay you may not be liable to pay any tax because your tax
credits and reliefs are more than or equal to the amount of tax you are due to
pay. (There is no income tax exemption for low income earners under 65.)</p>

<p>You are completely exempt from income tax if <a href="../income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/older_peoples_tax_credits_and_reliefs.html">you
are over 65 and your income is below certain limits.</a> Revenue provides
information on  <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/marital-and-civil-status/exemption-and-marginal-relief/index.aspx">Tax
Exemption and Marginal Relief</a> which details available exemption limits and
tax relief. If your income is over the limit then you may benefit from marginal
relief.</p>

<h2>Marginal relief</h2>

<p>If your income exceeds the limits for low income exemption, but is less than
twice the amount of the limit then you can claim marginal relief. Under
marginal relief, you are taxed only on the amount by which your income exceeds
the limit, but a special tax rate of 40% applies to this amount.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
Cormac is 66 years of age and is married. His total income for 2016 was
€40,000. Under the usual method of calculating his tax liability it would be
€2,560 but under marginal relief it would be €1,600.</p>

<p><strong>Under the usual method</strong> the tax liability is calculated as
follows:<br>
The income is below the standard rate cut-off point so all of it is taxed at
the standard rate of 20%<br>
40,000 x 20% = €8,000 gross tax</p>

<p>His tax credits are:<br>
Married: 3,300<br>
PAYE: 1,650<br>
Age: 490<br>
Total €5,440</p>

<p>The tax credits are subtracted from the gross tax to give the tax payable<br>
€8,000 - €5,440 = €2,560</p>

<p><strong>Under marginal relief</strong> the tax liability would be calculated
as follows.<br>
Total income: €40,000<br>
Minus <br>
Low income exemption limit: €36,000<br>
Gives €4,000 as the amount by which the income exceeds the limit. <br>
Marginal relief restricts the tax payable to 40% of this.<br>
4,000 x 40% = €1,600 </p>

<h2>Work expenses</h2>

<p>Some work expenses can be deducted from your income before it is assessed
for tax. To qualify, the expenses must be necessary in order to do your work
and must have been spent entirely for that purpose and no other.<br>
See Revenue for <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/employee-expenses/index.aspx">more
information on expenses that can be deducted</a> for tax purposes. </p>

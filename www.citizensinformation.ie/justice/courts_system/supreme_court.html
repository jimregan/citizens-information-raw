<p>Article 34 of <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Bunreacht
na hEireann</a> (the Irish Constitution) sets down that the courts system in
Ireland will include a Court of Final Appeal. This Court of Final Appeal is
known in Ireland as the '<span>Supreme Court</span>'. The Supreme Court
consists of the Chief Justice and 9 ordinary judges. The President of the Court
of Appeal and the President of the High Court are additional judges of the
Supreme Court. This court is located in Dublin. </p>

<p>Appeals are heard and determined by five judges unless the Chief Justice
directs that any appeal or other matter (apart from matters relating to the
Constitution) should be heard and determined by three judges.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="la1518">Jurisdiction</h2>

<p>The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>It hears appeals from the Court of Appeal if the Supreme Court is
    satisfied that:<br>
    - the decision involves a matter of general public importance or<br>
    - in the interests of justice it is necessary that there be an appeal to
    the Supreme Court</li>
  <li>It hears direct appeals from the High Court if the Supreme Court is
    satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances warranting a direct
    appeal to it. The Supreme Court must be satisfied that:<br>
    - the decision involves a matter of general public importance and/or<br>
    - it is in the interests of justice</li>
  <li>It has the power to decide if a question of the permanent incapacity of
    the President arises.</li>
  <li>It has the power to decide whether a Bill that has been passed by both
    Houses of the Oireachtas and presented to the President of Ireland for
    his/her signature before being enacted into law is repugnant to the
    Constitution. This happens when the matter is referred to the Supreme Court
    by the President.</li>
</ul><p>In a case where a proposed Bill has been referred to the Supreme Court it is
heard before seven judges. A <a shape="rect" href="../courtroom/barristers.html">barrister</a> represents the <a shape="rect" href="../../../government_in_ireland/national_government/the_irish_government/the_attorney_general.html">Office
of the Attorney General</a>, arguing the Bill is constitutional and should
remain as it is. The Court appoints another barrister to set out the reasons
why the Bill is unconstitutional and should not be enacted.</p>

<p>In cases examining whether or not a Bill is constitutional, the Supreme
Court makes one decision and this decision is final. If the Court finds the
Bill is contrary or repugnant to the Constitution, it cannot be enacted into
law in its present form. </p>

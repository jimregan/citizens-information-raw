<p>InjuriesBoard.ie, formerly known as the Personal Injuries Assessment Board
(PIAB), is an independent statutory body set up under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0046/index.html">Personal
Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003</a>. All personal injury claims in Ireland
(except for cases involving medical negligence) must be submitted to
InjuriesBoard.ie.</p>

<p>The Board provides an independent assessment of personal injury claims for
compensation following road traffic, workplace or public liability accidents.
Where the person responsible (the <em>respondent</em>) does not consent to
InjuriesBoard.ie assessing your claim for compensation, InjuriesBoard.ie will
allow you to pursue your claim through the courts. </p>

<p>Claims are assessed on average within 7 months of the respondent consenting.
Personal injury claims through litigation (that is, the courts) can take up to
36 months (3 years). </p>

<p>Claims are assessed using the medical evidence you provide from your doctor
and, if necessary, a report provided by an independent doctor appointed by
InjuriesBoard.ie. The assessment of the damages due is made having regard to
the particular injuries you sustained and your circumstances. Guideline amounts
for compensation in respect of particular injuries are set out in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.injuriesboard.ie/eng/Forms-Guidelines/Book-of-Quantum.pdf">Book
of Quantum (pdf)</a>. An <a shape="rect" href="http://www.injuriesboard.ie/eng/How-to-make-a-claim/Estimate-your-claim/">online
version known as the Estimator</a> as well as some <a shape="rect" href="http://www.injuriesboard.ie/eng/FAQs/">FAQ’s</a> are available on the
Board's website.</p>

<p>If the respondent does not agree to an assessment by InjuriesBoard.ie or if
either side rejects the Board’s award, the matter can then be referred to the
courts.</p>

<p>Under Section 17 of the 2003 Act, if your injury consists wholly or in part
of psychological damage which would be difficult to assess by means of the
Board’s assessment procedures, the Board may give you permission to pursue
your claim through the courts without an assessment of your claim.</p>

<p>Since August 2014, under the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Recovery-of-Benefits-and-Assistance.aspx">Recovery
of Certain Benefits and Assistance Scheme</a> the Department of Social
Protection can recover the value of certain illness-related social welfare
payments from compensation awards. The benefits are recovered from the
compensator and not from the injured person.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0031/index.html">Civil
Liabilities and Courts Act 2004</a> the time-limit for claims for compensation
is two years from the date of the accident. Even so, <span>it is very important
that you notify in writing the person you hold responsible for your injury of
the nature of the wrong they have committed within two months of the
accident</span>. While it may not affect your application to the Board, it may
affect your case later if you have to go to court.</p>

<p>When InjuriesBoard.ie receives your application for compensation, it will
issue a receipt for the fee and an application number. It will then inform the
person you hold responsible for your injury (the respondent) about your claim.
The respondent has 90 days to consent to the Board assessing your claim. If the
respondant agrees to this, he/she must pay a fee. If the respondent does not do
this, the Board will issue you with an <em>Authorisation</em><span>.
</span>This is a legal document allowing you to proceed with your claim through
the courts if you so wish.</p>

<p>When the Board makes its assessment, you, as the claimant, have 28 days to
decide whether you accept or reject the award. If you accept it, you must
acknowledge this in writing to InjuriesBoard.ie. If you don’t reply within 28
days, it is deemed that you have rejected the assessment. </p>

<p>The respondent has 21 days to accept or reject the assessment. If the
respondent does not reply within this time limit, it will be deemed he/she has
accepted the assessment. </p>

<p>If both parties accept the assessment, the Board will issue an <em>Order to
Pay</em> to the respondent. If either you or the respondent rejects the
assessment, the Board will issue you with an Authorisation allowing you to take
your claim to court. </p>

<p>Claimants are charged €45 to make an application to InjuriesBoard.ie for
compensation for a personal injury. </p>

<p>For respondents, if a claim has been made against you and you agree to allow
assessment by InjuriesBoard.ie you must pay a fee of €600 (was €850 before
January 2013). If your insurance company has agreed to handle the claim on your
behalf, it will pay this fee. </p>

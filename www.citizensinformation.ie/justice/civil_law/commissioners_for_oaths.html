<h3>Oaths and Affirmations</h3>

<p>A person making an oath will be required to swear the oath by raising the
New Testament. A person who is Jewish may swear the oath by raising the Old
Testament. It's important to remember that you may also be required to provide
evidence of your identity by the Commissioner particularly if you are having an
affadavit verified (but this largely depends on the type of documents that is
being verified). It is useful however to bring a standard form of
identification with you on your visit, (a passport, driving licence, social
welfare book, student I.D. card, etc.).</p>

<p>The oath to be taken by persons before the Commissioner for Oaths is as
follows </p>

<p>"I swear by Almighty God that this is my name and handwriting, and that the
contents of this my affidavit are true".</p>

<p>A person who objects to being sworn on the grounds that taking an oath is
against his/her religious belief or that he/she has no religious belief is
permitted to make a solemn affirmation, which is phrased as follows: </p>

<p>"I, A.B., do solemnly and sincerely affirm that this is my name and
handwriting, and that the contents of this my affidavit are true".</p>

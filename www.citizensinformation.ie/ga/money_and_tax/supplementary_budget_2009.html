age. </p>

<h3>Supplementary Welfare Allowance </h3>

<p>The personal rate of Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) will be reduced

<p>The maximum Increase for a Qualified Adult payable to a Supplementary
Welfare Allowance claimant aged under 20 will also be reduced to €100 per
week (first week of May 2009). </p>

<p>However, these reduced personal and qualified adult rates of payment will
not apply where a claimant is entitled to an Increase for a Qualified Child.
</p>

<h3>Christmas bonus </h3>

<p>The Christmas bonus paid in December to people getting certain social
welfare payments will not be paid in 2009. </p>

<h3>Rent Supplement </h3>

<p>Entitlement to Rent Supplement will be restricted to people who are existing
tenant for at least 6 months or who have been placed on a local authority
housing list following a full housing assessment. (from 27 April 2009 or as
soon as relevant legislation provisions allow) </p>

<p>The minimum household contribution is being increased from €18 to €24.
(from the end of May 2009) </p>

<p>The maximum rent limits will be reduced between 6% and 10%, depending on
geographical area and household size. (from the end of May 2009)</p>

<p>Rent Supplement payments currently being made to tenants are being reduced
by 8%, in order, to encourage landlords of existing rent supplement tenants to
reduce their rents. (from the end of May 2009)</p>

<h3>Mortgage Interest Supplement</h3>

<p>The minimum household contribution is being increased from €18 to €24.
</p>

<h3>Early Childcare Supplement </h3>

<p>Early Childcare Supplement (ECS) monthly payment will be halved to €41.50
per child (1 May 2009). </p>

<p>The supplement will be abolished at the end of 2009 and will be replaced in
January 2010 with a free pre-school year of Early Childhood, Care and Education
(ECCE) for all children between the ages of 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6
months. </p>

<h3>Back to Work Allowance </h3>

<p>The Back to Work Allowance (BTWA) will be closed to new applicants. </p>

<h3>Back to Education Allowance </h3>

at least 2 years. </p>

<p>To qualify for the third level option, the length of time you must be
getting a qualifying social welfare payment will be reduced from 12 months to 9
months in line with the National Employment Action Plan when recommended by a
Facilitator of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. </p>

<h3>Back to Work Enterprise Allowance </h3>

<p>A package of measures will be implemented to facilitate better access to the
Back to Enterprise Allowance Scheme (BTWEA): </p>
<ul><li>The amount of time you can participate on the BTWEA will be reduced from
    4 years to 2 years. </li>
  <li>The qualifying period required for BTWEA will be reduced from 2 years to
    12 months provided you have an underlying entitlement to Jobseeker's
    Allowance. </li>
  <li>If you have previously participated in the BTWEA scheme and exhausted
    your entitlement, you can participate a second time after period of at
    least 5 years has elapsed. </li>
  <li>If you qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit (with 104 contributions paid in
    the past 2 years) or you have been awarded statutory redundancy you may get
    immediate access to a shorter BTWEA. In this case, the allowance will be
    payable for the duration of your Jobseeker’s Benefit entitlement (that
    is, either 9 or 12 months). </li>
</ul><h3>PRSI </h3>

<p>The PRSI ceiling will increase from €52,000 to €75,036 (1 May 2009). <br></p>

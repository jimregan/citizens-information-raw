<h3>Other income tax provisions</h3>
<p><strong>Mortgage interest relief</strong> </p>
<p>The rate of mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers is being increased from 20% to 25% in year 1 and year 2 and to 22.5% in years 3, 4 and 5. The additional relief will be available to new first-time buyers and first-time buyers who have bought a house in the last 4 years. These changes take effect from 1 January 2009.</p>
<p>The rate of mortgage interest relief for non-first-time buyers is being reduced from 20% to 15% from 1 January 2009. </p>
<p><strong>Tax relief on unreimbursed medical expenses</strong></p>
<p>Tax relief on medical expenses will be granted at the standard rate only (20%) from 1 January 2009, with the exception of nursing home expenses which will be standard-rated from 1 January 2010.</p>
<p><strong>Levy on car parking facilities provided to employees by their employers</strong></p>
<p>A flat rate levy of €200 per year will be charged on employees whose employer provides them with car parking facilities. The levy only applies to employer-provided car parking facilities situated in the main urban centres. </p>
<p><strong>Cycle to work scheme </strong></p>
<p>From 1 January 2009, the provision of bicycles and associated safety equipment by employers to employees who agree to use the bicycles to cycle to work will be treated as a tax exempt benefit-in-kind. The exemption may only apply once in any 5 year period in respect of any employee. There will be a limit on the value of such purchases of €1,000 for each employee. The scheme may also be implemented through salary sacrifice arrangements, whereby an employee agrees to forgo part of their salary to cover the costs associated with the purchase of the bicycle and associated safety equipment. Where such salary sacrifice arrangements are implemented, they must be completed over a maximum period of 12 months. </p>
<p><strong>Increase in the specified rates for preferential home loans and other loans</strong></p>
<p>An employee in receipt of a preferential loan is charged income tax on the difference between the interest actually paid and the amount which would have been payable at the “specified” rates of interest for the loans. To reflect changes in interest rates, the specified rate in respect of loans (other than home loans which remain at 5.5%) is being increased from 13% to 15% from 1 January 2009. </p>
<p><strong>Tax relief for the donations of heritage items</strong> </p>
<p>The tax relief in respect of the donation of heritage items to approved State institutions is being limited to 80% of the market value of the heritage item donated. </p>
<p>The tax relief in respect of the donation of heritage property to the Irish Heritage Trust is being limited to 80% of the market value of the heritage property donated. </p>
<p>The ceiling on the aggregate value of donations qualifying for each of these schemes in any one year will remain at €6 million.</p>
<p><strong>Change to Benefit-in-Kind (BIK) charge for company cars</strong> </p>
<p>The Finance Bill will contain provisions to change the basis of the BIK charge on company cars to relate it to the CO2 emissions level of the car. </p>
<h3>VAT </h3>
<p>The standard rate of VAT will increase from 21 to 21.5% with effect from 1 December 2008. This increase will apply to all goods and services which are currently subject to VAT at 21 %. There is no change in the zero rate which applies to food, children’s clothes and footwear, oral medicines and several other products. The 13½% rate which applies to new houses, labour-intensive services, gas, electricity and home heating fuel also remains unchanged.</p>
<h3>Excise duties </h3>
<p><strong>Increase in tax on petrol</strong></p>
<p>The mineral oil tax on petrol will be increased by 8 cent per litre (including VAT) with effect from midnight on 14 October 2008. </p>
<p><strong>Tobacco excise</strong> </p>
<p>The Excise Duty on a packet of 20 cigarettes is being increased by 50 cent (including VAT) with a pro-rata increase on other tobacco products, with effect from midnight on 14 October 2008.</p>
<p><strong>Alcohol excise</strong> </p>

<p>A reduced rate of excise duty, at 50% of the full appropriate excise duty rate for beer and cider, will be introduced for low alcohol beer and cider (beer and cider products with an alcohol by volume content of 2.8% or less), with effect from midnight on 14 October 2008.</p>
<p><strong>Excise licences</strong> </p>
<p>A range of alcohol-related licensing fees, including off-licences, but excluding pub licences, are being increased to €500 in each case. These increases will apply from the appropriate annual renewal dates in 2009.</p>
<strong>
<h3></h3></strong><strong>Betting duty</strong> 

<p>The betting duty rate will be increased from 1% to 2% with effect from 1 January 2009. </p>
<strong>
<h3></h3></strong><strong>Air travel tax</strong> 

<p>An air travel tax applying to all departures from Irish airports will come into force on Monday 30 March 2009. The general rate will be €10 per passenger with a lower rate of €2 for shorter air journeys (under 300 km). </p>
<p>An indicative schedule listing the destinations from particular Irish airports to which the lower rate will apply is set out below. Other destinations from Irish airports in excess of 300 km will attract the €10 rate.</p>
<p>The Finance Bill will provide that the tax will be payable by the appropriate airport authority to the Revenue Commissioners for passengers departing from Irish airports on and from 30 March 2009. In effect the airport authority will collect the tax from the airlines.</p>
<p>The air travel tax will not apply to:</p>
<ul><li>passengers under 2 years </li>
<li>disabled passengers and people assisting them </li>
<li>aircraft with less than 20 passenger seats </li>

<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>There will be a 2.1% increase in health spending in 2009. Gross expenditure for the Health and Children Group, which includes the Department of Health and Children, the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is €16,335 million in 2009, an increase of €180.7 million. The underlying gross increase is €384.7 million when account is taken of the Long-term Care Repayment Scheme.</p>
<h3>Medical cards for over 70s</h3>
<p><strong>New applications</strong></p>
<p>From 1 January 2009 new income thresholds will apply for medical cards for people aged 70 and over. (The existing arrangements continue to apply until the end of 2008.) </p>
<p>New income thresholds will be €700 weekly gross for a single person (36,500 per year) and €1,400 a week (€73,000 a year) for a couple. It appears at present that there will be no deductions allowed as were outlined in previous announcements, for example, rent or mortgage or medical expenses. </p>
<p>If one member of a couple is aged 70, they will both qualify for a medical card if their income is below €1,400 a week. </p>
<p>Income from savings will be taken into account, but savings up to the first €36,000 (for a single person) and €72,000 (for a couple) are not counted. </p>
<p><strong>People over age 70 who already have a medical card</strong></p>
<p>The card will not expire on 31st December 2008, as stated in previous announcements.</p>
<p>The HSE will write to all people aged 70 and over informing them about the new arrangements. <strong>Only people who have income above the limits</strong> will be asked to reply to the HSE. Everyone else will simply keep their card. </p>
<p>People over these limits can still apply for medical cards on a hardship basis under the discretionary scheme. </p>
<h3>Fair Deal nursing home scheme</h3>
<p>€55 million is being provided to implement the Fair Deal scheme to provide a more equitable system of residential care for older people.</p>

<p>The funding provision for the Greener Homes Scheme run by SEI has been scaled back from €27 million to €12 million.</p>
<p>Capital expenditure of €10 million is provided for additional carbon reduction measures to target climate change initiatives in the transport sector.</p>
<p>The tax incentive introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2008, which provides for capital allowances of 100% of expenditure incurred by companies in the year the equipment is purchased, is being extended from 3 categories to 7 categories. The new categories to be included in this scheme are:</p>
<ul><li>Data server related systems and large energy saving office equipment associated with Information &amp;  Communications Technology  </li>
<li>Efficient heating/electricity provision equipment and control systems </li>
<li>Efficient electrical and control equipment associated with process &amp;  heating ventilation and air-conditioning systems </li>
<li>Alternative fuel vehicles </li>
</ul><p>The salmon conservation scheme is winding down in 2009, giving a reduction of €11.3 million on current spending, compared with 2008. There is also a reduction of €0.4 million on the Fisheries Boards funding.</p>
<p>Capital funding of €45 million is being provided for communications infrastructure. This will facilitate rollout of the National Broadband Scheme to ensure broadband availability within the timeframe 2009 to 2011 in rural areas not currently served by broadband.</p>

<h3>Education funding</h3>

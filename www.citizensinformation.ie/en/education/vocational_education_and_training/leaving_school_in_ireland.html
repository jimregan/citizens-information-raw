<p>If you intend <a href="../../third_level_education/colleges_and_qualifications/going_to_college_life_event.html">going
on to third-level education</a> on leaving school, you can find out how to
apply in our document on <a href="../../third_level_education/applying_to_college/application_procedures_and_entry_requirements.html">third-level
application procedures</a>. Offers of places on courses are decided largely by
Leaving Certificate results but some institutions offer outreach programmes. If
you have a disability you may be eligible for the <a href="../../third_level_education/applying_to_college/third_level_education_for_students_with_disabilities.html">DARE
access route</a> and if you come from a disadvantaged background you may be
eligible for <a href="../../third_level_education/applying_to_college/third_level_admissions_scheme_for_students_from_disadvantaged_backgrounds.html">HEAR</a>.</p>

courses</a> and <a href="apprenticeships.html">apprenticeships</a> for

<p>State agencies such as <a shape="rect" href="skills_training_linked_to_government_agencies.html">Coillte, Teagasc and
Bord Iascaigh Mhara all run training courses in their respective areas,</a> as
does the Crafts Council of Ireland. <a shape="rect" href="youthreach.html">Youthreach </a>also runs paid training courses for
school-leavers. </p>

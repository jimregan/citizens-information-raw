<p></p>

<p>If you have left school without any formal qualifications, the <a href="http://www.youthreach.ie/">Youthreach programme</a> can provide you with
opportunities for basic education, personal development, vocational training
and work experience.</p>

<p>The programme is generally full-time, although part-time courses can be
arranged. You can concentrate on a core training area of your choice but basic
subjects, such as English, maths and life skills, are generally covered by all
trainees.</p>

<p>Opportunities to improve literacy and numeracy are available at all
Youthreach centres.</p>

<h3>How Youthreach works</h3>

<p>The course generally lasts from 1 to 2 years, although it can be flexible,
depending on your individual needs. If you complete the basic training
successfully, you will be awarded a Foundation Certification from <a href="http://www.qqi.ie/">Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI)</a> or the
<a shape="rect" href="../../state_examinations/junior_certificate_programme.html">Junior
Certificate.</a> Having completed a Foundation Programme, you may continue to a
Progression Programme. This will give you the opportunity to progress to the <a shape="rect" href="../../state_examinations/leaving_certificate_applied.html">Leaving
Certificate Applied</a> course or a higher-level QQI award or you can choose to
continue other skills training, such as an <a shape="rect" href="http://www.fas.ie/en/Training/Apprenticeships/default.htm">apprenticeship
</a>course. </p>

<p>The courses take place in Youthreach centres managed by Education and
Training Boards (ETBs) and Community Training Centres. Generally, Youthreach
centres are open for 35 hours per week (9 a.m. - 4.30 p.m., Monday to
Friday).</p>

<p>If you qualify for Youthreach, you may also be eligible for the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/Further-Education-and-Training/Back-to-Education-Initiative-BTEI-/">Back
to Education Initiative</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Education and Training Boards</strong></p>

<p>Since 1 July 2013, Education and Training Boards (ETBs) replaced Vocational
Educational Committees (VECs). All services provided by VECs will continue to
be provided by ETBs. FÁS training centres have also transferred to ETBs.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The criteria you must meet to access the Youthreach programme depends on
whether you apply to a Youthreach centre managed by an Education and Training
Board (ETB) or a Community Training Centre. </p>

<p><strong>ETB Youthreach programme</strong></p>

<p>To be eligible for Youthreach provided by your local ETB, you should be
between 15 and 20 years of age. You must be unemployed and an early school
leaver without any vocational training and who has not attempted the Leaving
Certificate. Some exceptions can be made to this rule, for example if you are a
lone parent.</p>

<p><strong>Community Training Centre Youthreach programme</strong></p>

<p>To be eligible for Youthreach provided by your local <a href="http://www.iacto.ie/learners/ctcs/">Community Training Centre</a>, you
should be between 16 and 21 years of age. However, young people under the age
of 25 who are disadvantaged and unemployed may attend the programme with
agreement from SOLAS.</p>

<p>The training on offer varies from centre to centre, often depending on the
facilities available. If you have an interest in a particular career, you
should look around for a centre offering a suitable course rather than applying
automatically to the centre nearest to you.</p>

<p><strong>Jobseeker’s payment</strong></p>

<p>Participants leaving Youthreach can apply for a <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/signing_on.html">jobseeker’s
payment</a>. The <a href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Jobseekers-Allowance.aspx#StudentDisqualifications">3
month disqualification rule</a> which applies to many students does not apply
to Youthreach participants.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Courses are free and trainees aged over 16 receive a weekly allowance. You
will get a travel allowance if you have to travel 5 km or more to the centre.
You may also qualify for <a shape="rect" href="../fas_training_programmes_and_supports/child_care_support_during_fas_training_courses.html">free
childcare</a> and a meal allowance - you should check with the centre.</p>

<p>The 2016 weekly allowances are as follows: </p>

<table summary="Youthreach rates 2013"><thead><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Trainee(s) </th>
      <th colspan="1" rowspan="1">maximum payment per week </th>
    </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">16 - 17 years</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€40</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">18 years and over</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€160.00 (with some exceptions)</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>If you are over 18 years of age and you are currently getting a social
welfare payment of more than €160, you will continue to get the higher amount
while you are on Youthreach as long as you are eligible. If you were getting a
reduced age-related Jobseeker's Allowance (JA) before starting Youthreach any
means that were deducted from your JA will also be deducted from your training
allowance. This also applies to people getting a reduced age-related basic
Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA).</p>

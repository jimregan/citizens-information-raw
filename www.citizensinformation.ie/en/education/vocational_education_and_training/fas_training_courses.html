<p>Further Education and Training (FET) training courses are provided in <a href="http://www.etbi.ie/etbs/find-a-training-centre/">Education and Training
Board (ETB) Training Centres</a>. If you are unemployed or redundant or if you
wish to update your skills or change your career, there is a wide range of
training courses available to assist you.</p>

<p>You are eligible to take part in a FET training course if you are
unemployed, redundant or no longer in full-time education. You may also be
eligible if you are getting a disability-related social welfare payment or a
One-Parent Family Payment.</p>

<p><strong>FÁS, SOLAS and ETBs</strong></p>

<p>FÁS was dissolved and some of its functions were transferred to <a href="http://www.solas.ie/">SOLAS</a> - the new further education and training
authority. </p>

<p>In 2014, the FÁS training division transfered to the <a href="http://www.etbi.ie/etbs/directory-of-etbs/">Education and Training Boards
(ETBs)</a> which replaced VECs. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l0548c">Types of training courses </h2>

<p>There are training courses available under 2 different types of training.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.fas.ie/en/Training/Programmes/default.htm">The
Traineeship Programme</a></strong> provides training and relevant work
experience. If you are unemployed and looking for an opportunity to gain
training, experience and a formal qualification in a particular area of work,
the Traineeship Programme may suit your needs. Traineeships are full-time. The
duration of the programme will depend on the area in which you choose to train.
When your initial training is completed, you move back and forth between the
centre and the employer's workplace, further developing your skills and gaining
practical experience. When you complete your course you will receive a
Qualification and Quality Ireland (QQI) award at either Certificate or Advanced
Certificate level.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.fas.ie/en/Training/Traineeships/Traineeship+Courses/default.htm">range
of traineeships</a> available is likely to change so you need to keep in touch
with your local employment services office or Intreo centre for up-to-date
information.</p>

Skills Training</a></strong> allows people who have lost their job or who are
changing job to learn new job-related skills. There are <a shape="rect" href="http://www.fas.ie/en/Training/Programmes/Course+Types.htm">short and long
day courses</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.fas.ie/en/Training/Programmes/Online.htm">online courses,</a>

learning</a> and evening courses.The courses on offer vary from centre to
centre and from year to year with different levels of certification. The
courses are run during the day and in the evenings. Priority on daytime courses
is given to unemployed people. A day course is free to all unemployed people,
even if you are not getting a social welfare payment. An evening course is not
free unless you are getting a social welfare payment. <br></p>

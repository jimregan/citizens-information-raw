<p>If you are interested in a career related to fisheries, food, hospitality,
tourism, farming, forestry or crafts, you may find the course you are looking
for amongst those offered by Government-funded agencies that specialise in that
area.</p>

<p>Each of the agencies described below is directly linked to a particular
commercial or industrial sector and has a range of state-funded full-time and
part-time vocational courses on offer. </p>

<p>You need to check out each individual course with regard to details such as
entry requirements and training allowances as they can be very different. Some
agencies, for example, offer training courses at third level. These particular
courses require you to have formal qualifications and to apply through the
Central Applications Office as you would for any other third-level course.</p>

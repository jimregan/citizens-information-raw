<p>An apprenticeship is the recognised way people are trained to become
craftspeople. The <a href="http://www.apprenticeship.ie/en/apprentice/Pages/ApprenticeInfo.aspx">main
craft trades</a> have been designated by SOLAS and come within the scope of the
Statutory Apprenticeship system, which is organised by <a href="http://www.solas.ie/">SOLAS</a> in co-operation with the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/">Department of Education and Skills</a>,
employers and unions. An <a href="http://www.apprenticeshipcouncil.ie/">Apprenticeship Council</a> has also
been established. </p>

<p>An <a href="http://www.apprenticeship.ie/en/SitePages/Home.aspx">apprenticeship</a>
provides on-the-job training with an employer. An apprenticeship usually
alternates between off-the-job training in an education centre and on-the-job
training at your employer's workplace. An apprenticeship generally lasts for 4
years, during which time you will spend 3 different periods in off-the-job
training.</p>

<p>Generally, the first off-the-job training phase will take place in an <a href="http://www.etbi.ie/etbs/directory-of-etbs/">Education and Training Board
(ETB)</a> Training Centre while the subsequent off-the-job training phases will
take place in an <a href="http://www.ioti.ie/#active">Institute of
Technology</a>.</p>

<p>The skills you develop will be assessed through on-the-job competence
testing as well as off-the-job modular assessment and examinations and, if you
complete these assessments successfully, you will be awarded an Advanced
Certificate – craft (level 6). </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To be eligible for an apprenticeship, you must be at least 16 years of age
and you are expected to have a minimum of grade D in 5 subjects in the Junior
Certificate or equivalent exam. However, if you don't have these
qualifications, you can still register as an apprentice with an employer if
you:</p>
<ul><li>Complete an approved preparatory training course followed by an
    assessment interview. There is a specific preparatory training course
    available for people with disabilities</li>
  <li>Are over 18 years of age and have at least 3 years of relevant work
    experience, in which case you will also be asked to do an assessment
    interview.</li>
</ul><p>You will be asked to pass a colour-vision test approved by for some
apprenticeships.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p><strong>Apprenticeship fees</strong></p>

<p>Generally an apprentice does not pay fees. However, the student contribution
is levied on apprentices attending Institutes of Technology – this is usually
the fourth and fifth phase of an apprenticeship. Apprentices are not eligible
for the student grant.</p>

<p>The maximum rate of the student contribution for the academic year 2016-2017
is €3,000 - €1000 for apprentices attending phases no longer than 10-11
weeks. The student contribution is apportioned for the time an apprentice
spends in the Institute of Technology.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Apprenticeship wages/allowances</strong></p>

<p>While you are training on the job, your employer will pay you a <a href="http://www.apprenticeship.ie/en/apprentice/craft/Pages/ApprenticeInfo.aspx">recommended
apprenticeship wage</a>. If you are training in certain sectors, SOLAS pay a
weekly allowance equivalent to that wage while you are training off the job. In
all other industrial sectors, your off-the-job payments will be the
responsibility of your employer, although SOLAS will contribute to any
necessary travel and accommodation costs.</p>

<p>Momentum is an initiative which provides education and training to assist
long-term unemployed people gain the skills needed to access work in sectors of
the economy where there are job opportunities.</p>

<p>All Momentum education and training projects are free. There are full and
part-time projects available. Projects are from level 3 to 6 on the National
Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) or to an industry-required certification.</p>

<p>Momentum will provide eligible jobseekers with:</p>
<ul><li>Access to a range of quality education and training projects </li>
  <li>Links to identified job vacancies and employers </li>
  <li>Work placement and support </li>
  <li>Industry and NFQ (National Framework of Qualifications) Certification</li>
</ul><p>Some Momentum projects are specifically for unemployed people under 25 years
of age.</p>

<p>If Momentum doesn’t meet your needs, there are several <a href="../../returning_to_education/sources_of_information_on_returning_to_education.html">other
ways to access education and training</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The Momentum programme is currently not recruiting for
participants.</strong></p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<ul><li>Unemployed for at least 12 months*</li>
  <li>Getting <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker’s

  <li>Actively seeking work</li>
</ul><p>*If you have been unemployed for 12 of the previous 18 months you may be
considered eligible for Momentum.</p>

<p>Time spent on a <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">Back
to Education Allowance</a>, <a href="../../returning_to_education/vocational_training_opportunities_scheme.html">VTOS</a>,
<a href="../fas_training_programmes_and_supports/fas_training_courses.html">FÁS
training course</a>, Fáilte Ireland training course, <a href="youthreach.html">Youthreach</a>, Community Employment scheme, TUS,
Rural Social Scheme, Back to Work Allowance, Back to Enterprise Allowance, Job
Initiative and Job Assist may be counted towards meeting the qualifying
criteria for a Momentum project. You must have completed the scheme and be
signing on or getting a jobseeker’s payment.</p>

<p>You should check your <a href="http://www.momentumskills.ie/eligible.aspx">eligibility for a Momentum
project</a> with your local employment services office.</p>

<h3>Refusing a place on a Momentum project</h3>

<p>Your social welfare payment can be reduced if you refuse an appropriate
offer of training. Find out more in our documents on <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s
Allowance</a> and <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker’s
Benefit</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>You will continue to get your jobseeker’s payment while you are on the
project. Momentum participants aged under 26 who move from an age-related
reduced rate of Jobseeker’s Allowance will get a top-up rate of €160 per
week (any means you have will be deducted from this rate).</p>

<p>If you no longer meet the qualifying criteria for Jobseeker’s Allowance or
Jobseeker’s Benefit your social welfare payment will stop, but you may
continue on the Momentum project.</p>

<p>If your Jobseeker’s Benefit claim ends while you are on a Momentum
project, you can apply for Jobseeker’s Allowance and continue on Momentum
regardless of whether your Jobseeker’s Allowance claim is awarded.</p>

<p>If you are on a full-time Momentum course and you need childcare, you may
qualify for a free childcare place under the <a href="../fas_training_programmes_and_supports/child_care_support_during_fas_training_courses.html">Childcare
Employment and Training Support (CETS) scheme</a>.</p>

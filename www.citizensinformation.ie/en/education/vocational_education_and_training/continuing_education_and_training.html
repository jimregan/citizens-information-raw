<p>There are lots of ways to continue your education, further your training and
acquire new skills. </p>

<p>If you are <a href="leaving_school_in_ireland.html">leaving school</a>,
unemployed or looking for your first job, or if you are looking to change
direction in your career, you can choose from a large number of education and
training programmes funded by SOLAS, the <a href="http://www.etbi.ie/etbs/directory-of-etbs/">Education and Training Boards

range of full-time and part-time options so you can choose the one that best
suits your circumstances.</p>

or some other form of voluntary activity. Ask the co-ordinator of the group in

opportunities within that organisation.</p>

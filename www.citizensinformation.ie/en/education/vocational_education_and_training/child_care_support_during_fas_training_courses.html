<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="leb1f9">Information </h2>

<p>If you have applied for a vocational training course, you may need
childcare. Under the <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/childcare/CETSMainPage.htm">Childcare
Employment and Training Support (CETS) scheme</a>, you may qualify for a
subsidised childcare place for your child. CETS can provide full-time,
part-time or after-school childcare places. The CETS scheme is managed by the
Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) via the City and County
Childcare Committees.</p>

<p><strong>Budget 2016</strong></p>

<p>It was announced in Budget 2016, that a new <a href="https://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2Fearlyyears%2F20170412EarlyYearsFAQs.html&amp;mn=chiu3p&amp;nID=2">single
affordable childcare programme</a> will be developed to replace a number of
childcare programmes including CETS. The target date for the new programme is
2017.</p>

<h3>Courses that qualify for CETS</h3>

<p>Not all Education and Training Board courses qualify for CETS. The courses
that qualify for CETS include <a href="youthreach.html">Youthreach</a>, <a href="../returning_to_education/vocational_training_opportunities_scheme.html">Vocational
Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS)</a>, the <a href="../returning_to_education/community_education.html">Back to Education
Initiative (BTEI)</a>, <a href="fas_training_courses.html">Further Education
and Training (FET) courses (i.e. specific skills training and
traineeships)</a>, the <a href="http://www.fit.ie/">FIT Initiative</a> and <a href="courses_for_long_term_unemployed_people.html">Momentum</a>.</p>

<h3>Courses that do not qualify for CETS</h3>

<p>You will not qualify for CETS if you are on one of the following: <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/job_initiative.html">Job
Initiative,</a> <a shape="rect" href="fas_training_courses.html">SOLAS
apprenticeship</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../../adult_and_life_long_education/night_classes.html">an evening
course,</a> <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_and_disability/supported_employment_for_people_with_disabilities.html">supported
employment,</a> Job Club or the <a shape="rect" href="fas_work_placement_programme.html">Work Placement</a> programme.</p>

<p><strong>FÁS, SOLAS and ETBs</strong></p>

<p>FÁS was dissolved and some of its functions were transferred to SOLAS. <a href="http://www.solas.ie/">SOLAS</a> the new further education and training
authority was set-up on 26 October 2013. </p>

<p>On 1 January 2014, the FÁS training division began its transfer to the 16
<a href="http://www.etbi.ie/etbs/directory-of-etbs/">Education and Training
Boards (ETBs)</a> which replaced VECs. All training courses will have
transferred on 1 July 2014. If you are currently on a training course, you will
not be affected by these changes.<br></p>

    opportunity</li>
</ul><p>If you cannot find a place for your child you should contact your local City
or County Childcare Committee and let them know the area in which you need a
childcare place. They will ask the DCYA, who will try to provide additional
childcare places in your area. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You should let the course provider know that you have child care needs and
want to be considered for CETS.</p>

<p>When you get your letter offering you a place on a course, you will also be
given a list of local childcare providers. You should use this letter to book a
place for your child or children with a childcare provider.</p>

<p>When your training starts you will get a letter confirming that you have
started the course and giving the start and finish dates. You should show this
letter to the childcare provider to confirm the duration of your childcare
place.<br></p>

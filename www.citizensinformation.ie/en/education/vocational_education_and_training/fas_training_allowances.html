<p><a href="fas_training_courses.html">Further Education and Training (FET)
training courses</a> provided in Education and Training Boards (ETB) training
centres are free (except for <a shape="rect" href="http://www.fas.ie/en/Training/Programmes/EveningCourses.htm">evening
courses</a>) and you may be paid a training allowance for the duration of your
course. You can also claim an <a shape="rect" href="http://www.fas.ie/en/Allowances+and+Grants/Accommodation+and+Meal+Allowances.htm">accommodation
allowance</a> if you need to live away from home for the duration of the course
or a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.fas.ie/en/Allowances+and+Grants/Travel+Allowances.htm">travel
allowance</a> if you live 3 miles or more from the course centre. You may
qualify for a <a shape="rect" href="child_care_support_during_fas_training_courses.html">free childcare
place</a> for your child. FET allowances are not taxable.</p>

<p>To get a FET training allowance you must be entitled to a qualifying social
welfare payment, such as <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
Allowance</a> or <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker's
Benefit.</a> However, if you are aged under 18 and attending a Community
Training Centre you will get an age-related training allowance – see
‘Rates’ below.</p>

<p><strong>FÁS, SOLAS and ETBs</strong></p>

<p>FÁS was dissolved and some of its functions were transferred to <a href="http://www.solas.ie/">SOLAS</a> - the new further education and training
authority. </p>

<p>In 2014, the FÁS training division was transferred to the 16 <a href="http://www.etbi.ie/etbs/directory-of-etbs/">Education and Training Boards
(ETBs)</a> which replaced VECs. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lda30f">Social welfare payments and the FET training
allowance</h2>

<p>Your payment when on a FET training course will depend on the social welfare
payment you are getting.There is no qualifying period, which means you do not
need to have been getting a social welfare payment for a certain period of
time. </p>

<p><strong>Qualified adult dependant</strong>: If you are getting an <a href="../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">Increase
for a Qualified Adult</a> for your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant as part
of your social welfare payment, you can continue to get this while your adult
dependant is participating on a <a href="fas_training_courses.html">FET
course</a>. Your adult dependant will not get a FET training allowance.
However, they may qualify for travel and other allowances. Check with the
course provider if these allowances are available with their course.</p>

<h3>Jobseeker's Allowance or Supplementary Welfare Allowance </h3>

<p>Since 1 January 2014, if you are a new participant aged 26 or over and
getting Jobseeker's Allowance (JA) or Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) you
will have your payment suspended, but <strong>you will get a FET training
allowance of the same amount</strong>. </p>

<p>If you are getting a reduced age-related Jobseeker's Allowance you will have
your payment suspended, but you will get a FET training allowance of €160.
Any means that were deducted from your JA will also be deducted from your FET
training allowance. This also applies to people getting a reduced age-related
basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance.</p>

<p>If your entitlement to Jobseeker's Allowance or Supplementary Welfare
Allowance stops during the FET course, your FET training allowance will
stop.</p>

<h3>Jobseeker's Benefit</h3>

<p>If you are getting <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker's
Benefit</a> your social welfare payment will stop and you will get a FET
training allowance of the same amount. If you do not find employment when your
course ends, you can reapply for Jobseeker’s Benefit. Your Jobseeker’s
Benefit <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Jobseekers-Benefit.aspx#part6">claim may
be linked</a> to your previous claim for Jobseeker’s Benefit - this means
that your claim is not treated as a new claim. </p>

<h3>Disability Allowance or Blind Pension</h3>

<p>Your <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability

Pension</a> is suspended but <strong>you will get a FET training allowance of
the same amount</strong>. The rules that apply to your original social welfare
payment also apply to your FET training allowance. You must inform social
welfare of any changes to your circumstances.</p>

<p>You will also keep any secondary benefits, such as your medical card or
travel pass.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fas.ie/en/Allowances+and+Grants/Training+Allowances/Jobseeker+Benefit-Jobseeker+Allowance+Recipients.htm">If
you have a disability</a>, the Education and Training Board will apply flexible
sick leave arrangements if necessary.</p>

Benefit</a> or <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/invalidity_pension.html">Invalidity
Pension</a> (but you must get an exemption from the Department of Social
Protection authorising you to do the FET course). The rules that apply to your
social welfare payment will continue to apply while you are on the FET course.
You will keep your secondary benefits.</p>

<h3>One-Parent Family Payment</h3>

<p>You will keep your <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent

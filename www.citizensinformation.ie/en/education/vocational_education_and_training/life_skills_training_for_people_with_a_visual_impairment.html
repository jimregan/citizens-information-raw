<p>The National Council for the Blind of Ireland (NCBI) offers a rehabilitation
programme entitled <span><a href="http://www.ncbi.ie/our-services/living-independently-2/">Learning for
life</a></span> for people with a significant degree of sight loss. This
includes individuals with impaired vision since birth and those whose vision
impairment has occurred later in life (for example, as a result of an accident,
illness, or a progressive disorder). </p>

<p>The aim of the programme is to maximise the quality of life and independence
of trainees in accordance with their own wishes. Core elements of the course
include mobility, technology training, and daily living skills. The programme
aims to provide trainees with the skills, knowledge and attitude required to
access further education and training. </p>

<p>The course is open to anyone who is eligible to apply. No previous
educational or other qualifications are necessary to do the course; likewise,
applicants will not be excluded from the course if they do have educational or
other qualifications or are working. You can find more information in our
document about <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_and_disability/working_with_a_disability.html">working
with a disability.</a></p>

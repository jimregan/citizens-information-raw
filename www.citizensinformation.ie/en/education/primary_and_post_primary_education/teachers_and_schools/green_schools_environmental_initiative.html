<p>A number of educational initiatives award flags to schools that successfully
participate in their programmes. The individual programmes are sometimes known
by the colour of the flag they award. The Green-Schools award is called the
Green Flag, the Active School Flag is known as the Blue Flag and the Yellow
Flag is given to schools that participate in the Diversity in Schools
Programme. These awards are open to both primary schools and post-primary
schools.</p>

<h3>Green Flag</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.greenschoolsireland.org/">Green-Schools</a> is the Irish
branch of an international environmental education programme and award scheme
known as <a href="http://www.eco-schools.org/">Eco-Schools</a>. It is designed
to raise students' awareness of environmental and sustainable development
issues through classroom study. Green-Schools is run by <a href="http://www.antaisce.org/">An Taisce</a>, in conjunction with <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/local_and_regional_government/local_authorities.html">local
authorities</a>. The scheme offers a way to take environmental issues from the
curriculum and apply them to the day-to-day running of the school, for example
reduce litter, waste and fuel bills. This process helps students to recognise
the importance of environmental issues and take them more seriously in their
personal and home lives.</p>

<p>The Green-Schools award is given to schools that successfully complete the
programme. A Green-Schools award is in the form of a Green Flag that can be
flown outside the school or displayed in a foyer. Award winners also receive a
certificate, a logo to display on headed notepaper and other publicity
material.</p>

<h3>Active School Flag</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://activeschoolflag.ie/">Active School Flag (ASF)</a> is
awarded by the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/">Department of Education
and Skills (DES)</a> to schools that strive to achieve a physical educated and
physically active school community. The initiative is open to primary and post
primary schools, special schools and Youthreach centres.</p>

<p>The Active School Flag is awarded to schools that:</p>
<ul><li>Adhere to DES guidelines regarding physical education (PE) timetable
    provision for all students</li>
  <li>Teach a broad and balanced PE curriculum</li>
  <li>Inform and invite the whole school community to participate in the ASF
    process</li>
  <li>Self-evaluate current provision in terms of PE, physical activity and
    community links</li>
  <li>Plan and implement improvements for each of the above areas</li>
  <li>Organise an <a href="http://activeschoolflag.ie/index.php/active-school-week/">Active
    School Week</a> as part of the annual school calendar</li>
</ul><p>The ASF is a whole-school process. It also helps schools to forge closer
working links with parents, the local community and outside agencies to help
promote physical activity and sport. It is non-competitive and schools should
work to their own time frame to plan and implement improvements that will have
an effect on their school community. Each of the steps of the ASF process is
described in more detail in the <a href="http://activeschoolflag.ie/index.php/resources/#toggle-id-2">ASF
Guidelines Booklets</a>.</p>

<p>An Active School Flag (Blue Flag) is awarded to schools that successfully
complete the ASF process.</p>

<h3>Yellow Flag</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.yellowflag.ie/">Yellow Flag</a> is part of the
Diversity in Schools Programme. This programme provides a series of steps that
brings issues of interculturalism, equality and diversity into the whole-school
programme and allows schools to apply them to the running of the school. It
also works with students, staff, management, parents and wider community groups
so that issues of diversity and equality can be understood and taken outside
the school setting. It can involve training for staff and setting up a
diversity committee.</p>

<p>If a school successfully participates in the programme, the school is
awarded a Yellow Flag in recognition of its work in promoting diversity and
inclusion. The award is publicised locally, and the school can fly the Yellow
Flag and use the logo on its official correspondence. <br></p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>All State primary and post-primary schools in Ireland must be inspected by
the Department of Education and Skills on a regular basis. The purpose of
inspections is to ensure that high standards are maintained and that there is
continuing development of the educational system. The Department has a special
division called the Inspectorate that works to achieve these objectives. </p>

<p>The legislation dealing with school inspection is the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0051/index.html">Education
Act (1998)</a> which sets out the responsibilities of the Inspectorate. In
general terms, the Inspectorate evaluates and reports on the quality of
education provision and is involved in: </p>
<ul><li>Inspecting and evaluating the education system (particularly at primary
    and post-primary level) </li>
  <li>Giving advice to those working in the education system </li>
  <li>Contributing to education policy development. </li>
</ul><p>The Child and Family Agency is responsible for assessing the education
provision for children who are not attending a recognised school. This includes
children who attend private schools. <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/The-Department/Management-Organisation/Inspectorate.html">The
Inspectorate</a> has drawn up guidelines on monitoring this education provision
for the <a href="http://www.tusla.ie/services/educational-welfare-services/">Child and
Family Agency</a>.</p>

<h3>Structure of the Inspectorate</h3>

<p>The Inspectorate is organised two subdivisions: Regional Services and Policy
Support. These subdivisions contain teams of inspectors, which are known as
business units. Each unit is headed by an Assistant Chief Inspector. </p>

<p><span>Regional Services:</span> There are five regional units, which are
responsible for monitoring the quality of schools in their respective areas.
Each unit is staffed by a team of primary- and post-primary-level inspectors
who provide evaluation services (including inspections) in the region. In
addition to evaluative work, inspectors provide advice and support to schools,
boards of management, teachers and others in the education system. Within the
counties covered by a regional unit, primary schools are given the names and
contact details of inspectors assigned to them. </p>

<h3>Programmes of inspection and evaluation</h3>

<h3>Primary schools</h3>

<p>Primary schools are inspected on a cyclical basis in line with annual
inspection targets. A school report (<span>Tuairisc Scoile</span>) is prepared
on each primary school on average every seven years following a detailed school
inspection. This report is passed on to the school staff and boards of
management. This evaluation of the school examines all aspects of teaching,
learning and assessment, as well as school planning, the work of the board of
management, and the school's accommodation and resources. The work of
individual teachers is inspected in accordance with the Rules for National
Schools and much of this work will relate to the evaluation and support of
probationary teachers. Inspectors also carry out frequent incidental inspection
visits to schools to familiarise themselves with the ongoing work of particular
schools and teachers. The inspection of primary schools is being further
developed with the introduction of Whole School Evaluation (see below) which
will replace the <span>Tuairisc Scoile</span> model of inspection.</p>

<h3>Post-primary schools</h3>

<p>Specialist inspectors undertake subject inspections in post-primary schools.
An evaluation report on the teaching of a particular subject is given to the
school. Inspectors may also visit schools in a number of other contexts, for
example, the monitoring of special programmes that may be in place in that
particular school. Whole School Evaluation (see below) has been introduced to
secondary schools to complement other types of inspection. </p>

<p>Until March 2003 much of the work of the post-primary inspectors was the
organisation of the Junior and Leaving Certificate examinations. This is now
being done by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.examinations.ie/">State
Examinations Commission</a> which publishes the Chief Examiners' reports on the
outcomes of the examinations in a number of subjects. These reports give
schools and teachers detailed information on how students have performed in
each part of the examination in a given subject. </p>

<h3>Other centres of education</h3>

<p>The Inspectorate is also responsible for evaluating <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/Quality-Assurance/Information.html">certain
types of educational provision</a>. </p>

<p>In addition, the Child and Family Agency under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0022/index.html">Education
Welfare Act 2000</a> may ask the Inspectorate to assess the education provided
in places other than recognised schools. These assessments may assist the
Agency to decide if children in non-recognised schools are receiving an
appropriate minimum education.</p>

<h3>Whole School Evaluation (WSE)</h3>

<p>Since 2003-2004 this type of evaluation has been phased into primary and
post-primary schools. It aims to improve schools and complements school
inspections. The WSE has been developed using a partnership approach and it is
designed to: </p>
<ul><li>Allow the whole school community to participate in the evaluation </li>
  <li>Affirm good practice in schools and provide advice and support </li>
  <li>Ensure school accountability by providing reliable data on the operation
    of the school </li>
  <li>Enable teachers and schools to use the evaluation criteria for school
    self-review </li>
  <li>Provide information to contribute to development of education policies
  </li>
</ul><p>The WSE evaluates schools under the headings of management, planning,
curriculum provision, learning and teaching, and support for students. The WSE
process includes pre-evaluation meetings with staff and management, meeting
with parents’ association, school and classroom visits, preparation of a
draft report, post-inspection meetings with staff and management, finalisation
of the WSE report and issue of report to school.</p>

<h3>Thematic/programme evaluation</h3>

<p>The Evaluation Support and Research Unit (ESRU) of the Inspectorate is
responsible for evaluating aspects of education provision throught thematic or
programme evaluations. At post-primary level these include Transition Year,
Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, Leaving Certificate Applied and the
Junior Certificate School Programme. The success of these programmes has been
evaluated and the Inspectorate has published reports giving full details of its
findings. You can contact the Inspectorate for details of how to get copies of
these reports. At primary level, evaluations carried out include, for example,
provision for Traveller education; implementation of the primary school
curriculum; literacy and numeracy in schools designated as disadvantaged. </p>

<h3>Special educational needs</h3>

<p>Since 2003 the Inspectorate’s role in the provision of resources for
pupils with special educational needs has greatly reduced. This work is now
done by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ncse.ie/">National Council for
Special Education</a>. The Inspectorate continues to evaluate the services for
pupils with special educational needs</p>

<h3>Policy development and review</h3>

<p><span>Curriculum development:</span> The Inspectorate contributes to
curriculum and syllabus development by representing the Department of Education
and Skills on the primary and post-primary committees of the National Council
for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).</p>

<p><span>In-career development of teachers:</span> The Department of Education
and Skills funds a wide range of initiatives that assist teachers to improve
their managerial and teaching skills. The Inspectorate contributes by helping
to identify priorities for in-career development programmes and by monitoring
the quality of the courses delivered to teachers. </p>

<p><span>Monitoring teacher education/teacher accreditation:</span> In addition
to their work with probationary teachers, inspectors in the primary sector also
monitor the standards of student teachers as they complete their undergraduate
studies. At present, members of the Inspectorate are involved in the
accreditation process for teachers at primary and post-primary levels. At
second level much of the Inspectorate’s work advising on qualifications and
accreditation of teachers is being transferred to the <a href="http://www.teachingcouncil.ie/">Teaching Council</a> which was
established in 2006 under the <a href="http://www.teachingcouncil.ie/about-us/some-relevant-leglislation.561.html">Teaching
Council Acts 2001 and 2006</a>. </p>

<p><span>School self-review and school development planning</span> The
Inspectorate promotes the development of school self-review and development
planning processes both within schools and through its involvement in the
School Development Planning Initiative at primary and second levels. </p>

<h3>Special education</h3>

<p>Inspectors contribute very significantly in supporting the provision of
targeted educational services for pupils with special needs at first and second
levels. </p>

<h3>Disadvantage and social inclusion</h3>

<p>The Inspectorate has a central role in planning, managing and overseeing
educational input into a wide range of initiatives designed to deal with
educational disadvantage and to promote social inclusion. They place a
particular emphasis on school retention and home-school links and in supporting
developments in educational provision for Travellers and for foreign
nationals.</p>

<h3>Other activities</h3>

<p><span>Wider linkages:</span> The Inspectorate participates in and
contributes to the work of relevant North/South educational initiatives and
various EU and other international organisations. A key element of this work is
its involvement in international surveys of student attainment. </p>

<p><span>Planning and building:</span> Inspectors attached to the Planning and
Building units of the Department of Education and Skills provide specialist
support and advice on matters associated with educational buildings. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The Professional Code of Practice on Evaluation and Reporting for the
Inspectorate sets out general principles and guidelines that inspectors use for
evaluation and reporting. The guidelines apply equally to evaluating and
reporting on the work of schools as units, on individual teachers, on
curricular programmes and on the implementation of Ministerial regulations,
carried out by inspectors working individually or in teams. Reports of schools
inspections carried out since 6 February 2006 are made available to the public.
These inspection reports are published according to the Inspectorate’s
Guidelines on the Publication of School Reports and do not include details of
examination results. The inspection report is first sent to the school which
has the right to respond to the Inspectorate’s report within 21 days. The
Inspectorate will then publish the report and the school’s response. Reports
of school inspections carried out before 6 February 2006 are not generally
available to the public. However, access may be given at the discretion of the
school.</p>

<h3>Accidents at school</h3>

<p>If a child has an accident in the school, in the schoolyard, on the way to
school, on the school bus or while on a school trip, the question of whether or
not the school or the teachers were negligent may arise.</p>

<p>There is no simple answer to the question of when the school may be liable.
Everything depends on the facts of the individual case.</p>

<h3>Teachers' duty of care</h3>

<p>The general law of negligence provides that a person may be negligent if</p>
<ul><li>He/she owes a duty of care to the person injured and </li>
  <li>He/she did not carry out that duty to the legal standard required and</li>
  <li>The person suffered damage as a result of the failure to observe the duty
    of care.</li>
</ul><p>In any given case, the actual facts must be examined closely to see if all
these elements are present.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that teachers owe a duty of care to students. When this
duty starts, where it ends and precisely what constitutes a breach of duty are
not nearly so clearcut.</p>

<p>The following general principles apply:</p>
<ul><li>Teachers must take reasonable care to ensure that their students do not
    meet with foreseeable injury. They have a duty to protect the children
    against foreseeable risks of personal injury or harm.</li>
  <li>The standard of care is that of a reasonably prudent parent. The degree
    of care depends on such factors as the age of the students.</li>
  <li>There must be an effective system of supervision in operation in the
    school. </li>
</ul><p>The duty of care applies while the students are on the school premises
during school opening hours. It may also apply if the students are present
outside of official school hours, e.g., if they arrive early or leave late and
the teacher/school has agreed to the students being present</p>

<p>The same duty of care applies if a teacher voluntarily supervises children.
</p>

<p>Teachers are required to follow good standards and approved practice. Risky
classes and activities require a greater degree of supervision. If goggles,
protective clothing, etc., are supplied for certain activities, it is the
teacher's duty to ensure that they are worn</p>

<p>Teachers are not insurers and cannot be responsible for every accident in
school hours. The courts accept that some accidents will happen no matter how
well supervision is carried out and, in such cases, the teacher/school cannot
be held liable. </p>

<h3>Insurance</h3>

<p>The Board of Management is vicariously liable for the negligence of its
teachers. That means that the board is sued in such cases. </p>

<p>The board is obliged to have comprehensive insurance cover for the school.
This insurance must cover public liability, negligence by staff or defects in
the buildings. The insurance policy must be available for inspection.</p>

<p>Some parents take out insurance to cover children against accidents at
school that are not the responsibility of the school. Some schools encourage
parents to do this. This is entirely a matter of personal choice. The general
health services are available to children in the normal way if they suffer an
injury at school </p>

<h3>Safety standards in schools</h3>

<p>Schools are obliged to abide by the usual safety rules that apply to public
buildings and the normal rules that apply to employee safety at work.</p>

<h3>School discipline</h3>

<p>Schools are required to have a code of behaviour in relation to <a href="../attendance_and_discipline_in_schools/school_discipline.html">school
discipline</a> and <a href="../attendance_and_discipline_in_schools/bullying_in_schools_in_ireland.html">bullying</a>
and teachers are obliged to behave in accordance with that code.</p>

<h3>Child abuse</h3>

<p>There are specific rules and <a href="../attendance_and_discipline_in_schools/child_abuse.html">guidelines
for teachers</a> if an issue of child abuse arises.</p>

<h3>Professional ability</h3>

<p>In general, teachers must be registered with the Teaching Council in order
to be paid from public funds. Complaints may lead to withdrawal of registration
on a temporary or permanent basis. The Teaching Council provides information
about <a href="http://www.teachingcouncil.ie/en/Professional-Standards/Complaints-about-Registered-Teachers/Making-a-Complaint/">making
a complaint to the Council about a registered teacher</a>.</p>

<p>Unless there are good and sufficient reasons, the Teaching Council will
generally not look into a complaint unless school complaint or grievance
procedures have been exhausted. Good and sufficient reasons include where
children or vulnerable adults are, or may be, at risk of harm. </p>

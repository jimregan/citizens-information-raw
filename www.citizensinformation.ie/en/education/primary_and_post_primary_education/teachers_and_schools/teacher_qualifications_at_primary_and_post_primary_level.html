<p>The <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/The-Department/Management-Organisation/Teacher-Education-Section.html">Teacher
Education Section</a> of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.education.ie">Department of Education and Skills</a> was
established to oversee teacher education policy and practice. The Department is
involved in policy formulation, co-ordination, general direction and
management, quality and financial control in supporting the provision of
education and continuing support for teachers and schools. </p>

<h3>The Teaching Council<br></h3>

<p>The Teaching Council is the professional standards body for teaching that
promotes and regulates the profession. As the regulatory body for teachers in
Ireland, the Teaching Council produces a code of professional conduct for
teachers, which covers standards of teaching, knowledge, skill and competence.
It also maintains a register of teachers. <br></p>

<h3>Primary teachers</h3>

<p>Primary school teachers must be qualified to teach the range of <a shape="rect" href="../going_to_primary_school/curriculum_in_national_schools.html">primary
school subjects</a> to children aged 4 to 12 years. To qualify as a primary
school teacher, you must have completed one of the following:</p>
<ul><li>A recognised full-time degree programme, leading to the Bachelor of
    Education (B.Ed.) degree </li>
  <li>A recognised Professional Masters in Education (Primary)</li>
</ul><p>A <a href="http://www.teachingcouncil.ie/teacher-education/initial-teacher-education-ite.191.html">list
of recognised colleges</a> providing approved programmes is available on the
website of the Teaching Council of Ireland. </p>

<p><strong>Irish language requirements:</strong> Primary school teachers must
be able to teach the Irish language and the range of primary school subjects
through Irish. </p>

<h3>Post-primary teachers</h3>

<p>Post primary teachers are normally required to teach at least 1 subject
which they have studied to degree level. Post-primary teachers do not need to
have a qualification in the Irish language unless they are employed by a
Gaeltacht school or a school where Irish is the medium of instruction. </p>

<p>Qualification is usually achieved by gaining a primary degree from a <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/Employing-a-Teacher/">recognised
third-level institution</a>. This degree must include at least 1 subject from
the <a shape="rect" href="../going_to_post_primary_school/senior_cycle.html">post-primary
schools’ curriculum</a> for the Leaving Certificate Programme. The Teaching
Council is the professional standards body for teaching the promotes and
regulates the profession. The primary degree is followed by a postgraduate
qualification in education such as the Professional Masters in Education
(PME).</p>

<h3>Recognition of qualifications</h3>

<p>The Teaching Council is the statutory body that sets the standards of
academic achievement and professional training required of teachers. </p>

<h2>Teachers who qualified outside Ireland</h2>

<h3>Recognition of qualifications<br></h3>

<p>If you are a primary or post-primary school teacher who qualified outside
Ireland and you wish to teach in a recognised school, you must apply for
recognition of your qualifications prior to registration. The Teaching Council
is responsible for processing applications and regulating admissions to the
teaching profession in Ireland. Qualifications obtained outside the EU must be
acceptable to the Council. Once your qualifications have been recognised, you
may then apply for registration. </p>

<h3>Foreign language assistants scheme<br></h3>

<p>This scheme allows for language assistants from France, Germany, Spain,
Austria and Italy to be assigned to post-primary schools and colleges in
Ireland. Their fluency can help students understand and speak a foreign
language and give them a better understanding of the way of life and customs of
other countries. In the same way Irish students of French, German, Italian and
Spanish can apply to work as English language assistants in the countries
listed above. Details of the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0015_2009.doc">English
Language Assistant scheme</a> can be found on the Department of Education and
Skills website.</p>

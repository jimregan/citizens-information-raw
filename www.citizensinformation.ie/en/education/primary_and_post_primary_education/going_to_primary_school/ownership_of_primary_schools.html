<p>The majority of primary schools in Ireland are privately owned and supported
by the different churches. The State pays the bulk of the building and running
costs and a local contribution is made towards the running costs. </p>

<p>In the case of Catholic and Church of Ireland schools, the owners are
usually the diocesan trustees. Other denominational schools usually have a
board of trustees nominated by the church authorities. Multi-denominational
schools are usually owned by a limited company or board of trustees.
Gaelscoileanna may be denominational and come under the same patronage as
Catholic schools but some have their own limited company. You can get more
information in our document about different <a shape="rect" href="types_primary_school.html">types of primary schools.</a></p>

<h3>Ownership of different types of schools</h3>

<p>The majority of primary schools are owned by the religious denominations.
There are deeds of trust signed by the owners, which ensure that the school
will continue to be used as such.</p>

<p>There are 9 'model schools', which are owned by the State. There are several
special schools owned by the State. The special schools have a range of
different owners - some are owned by the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/">Department of Education and Skills,</a> some
by the Commissioners of Public Works, some by the <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/how_health_is_organised/health_boards.html">Health Service
Executive</a> and some by religious orders.</p>

<p>The Education Act 1998 clarifies and restates the fact that the <a shape="rect" href="boards_of_management.html">board of management</a> does not
acquire any right over or interest in the land or buildings of the school for
which it has responsibility. </p>

<h3>The patron</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0051/index.html">Education
Act 1998</a> gives a statutory basis to the role of the patron and sets out the
rules for determining who the patron is. The patron may manage the school
personally or may appoint a board of management to act as manager. Under the
Act the patron has the power to remove the board and take over managing the
school or appoint another board. A register of patrons is kept by the
Department of Education and Skills so it is possible for anyone to check
exactly who the patron of any national school is.</p>

<p>In general, the patron of a school is a representative of the owners and can
be an individual or a group. In practice, the Catholic and Church of Ireland
bishops are the patrons of the schools within the diocese, with the parish
priest usually carrying out the functions on behalf of the bishop. The patron
of a multi-denominational school is usually the board of trustees or the
limited company <a shape="rect" href="http://www.educatetogether.ie">Educate
Together</a>. Gaelscoileanna may be under the patronage of the church
authorities but may opt to be under the patronage of <a href="http://www.foras.ie/">Foras Pátrúnachta na Scoileanna
Lán-Ghaeilge,</a> which is a limited company set up for the purpose. <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Press-Events/Press-Releases/2007-Press-Releases/PR07-02-17.html">A
new model of primary school patronage was introduced on a pilot basis in
2007</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Press-Events/Conferences/Patronage-and-Pluralism-in-the-Primary-Sector/">Forum
on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector</a> was set up in 2011 to
consider how primary school patronage structures might be adapted to reflect
changes in society. Its report was published on 10 April 2012. </p>

<h3>Funding of schools</h3>

<p>Traditionally, the site for national schools was provided locally - either
directly by the patron or as a result of local fundraising. There was also a
local contribution to the building costs and the running costs. Changes were
made over the years as multi-denominational schools and Gaelscoileanna were
being built and did not have a 'local' funding base. New arrangements were
introduced in 1999. </p>

<p>Private primary schools get no State funding.</p>

<h3>Cost of site - new national schools</h3>

<p>The State pays the full cost of the site. The patron still has the choice of
funding the site cost. If the State pays, then the State owns the school
building and leases it to the patron under a lease or a deed of trust.</p>

<p>If the patron pays, the patron owns the school. If the State pays, it does
not change who the patron is.</p>

<h3>Gaelscoileanna</h3>

<p>The funding for new Gaelscoileanna is now on the same basis as other new
schools. The previous arrangement continues for Gaelscoileanna that have either
permanent or provisional recognition from the Department of Education and
Skills. The previous arrangement for Gaelscoileanna meant that the Department
bought the site and paid the full building cost. In practice, a significant
number of Gaelscoileanna are in rented accommodation and the state pays the
rent.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/">Gaelscoileanna Teo</a>
is a voluntary body (supported by An Foras Teanga), which is the co-ordinating
body for Irish language schools and helps parents to set up new
Gaelscoileanna.</p>

<h3>Running costs of schools</h3>

<p>The State pays a direct capitation grant of €170 per student to each
primary school. The State pays the teachers' salaries. Enhanced capitation
grants are paid for children with special educational needs in special schools
or who attend special classes in mainstream schools. Capitation grants are used
for the day-to-day running of schools and for teaching materials and
resources.</p>

<p>Primary schools also receive a grant for caretaking and secretarial services
(called the Ancillary Services Grant Scheme) and this is €153 per student or
€77.50 per student, depending on whether the school gets the full-rate or
half-rate grant. A local contribution was formerly required but has now been
abolished.</p>

<p>Each school also receives a book grant. This is €21 per pupil for DEIS
schools and €11 per pupil for non- DEIS schools.</p>

<p>Each school gets a grant towards the cost of minor works. </p>

<p>Some schools qualify for enhanced funding under various schemes for <a shape="rect" href="giving_children_an_even_break_by_tackling_disadvantage.html">tackling

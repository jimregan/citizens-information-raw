<p>Children starting school can attend national schools, which are State-aided
and do not charge fees, or they can attend one of a small number of private
primary schools, which do not get any State funding and which charge fees. The
vast majority of children attend the state-aided primary or national schools.
</p>

<p>The rules about <a shape="rect" href="../attendance_and_discipline_in_schools/school_attendance.html">school
attendance</a> apply from age 6. In practice, nearly all 5-year-olds are at
school and about half of 4-year-olds in Ireland also attend school. Children
may not be enrolled at primary school before the age of 4.</p>

<p>There are various <a shape="rect" href="../../pre_school_education_and_childcare/early_childhood_education.html">early
education or pre-school facilities available</a> but they are mostly private
and fees have to be paid. There are some State-funded pre-school facilities,
which are usually for children who are disadvantaged or have special needs. The
State also funds one year of free pre-schooling under the <a shape="rect" href="../../pre_school_education_and_childcare/early_childhood_care_and_education_scheme.html">Early
Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme</a>. </p>

<p>There is a system of <a shape="rect" href="../../pre_school_education_and_childcare/health_safety_and_welfare_of_preschool_childcare_services.html">regulation
of pre-schools</a> under the Child Care Act 1991.</p>

<h3>National schools/primary schools </h3>

<p>The national school system was established in 1831. The national schools
were originally meant to be mixed-religion (or multi-denominational as we would
describe them today). In practice, that did not happen and the majority of
national schools are under the management of one church. However, since the
1970s Educate Together has established many multi-denominational national
schools.</p>

<p>When the national schools were originally set up, there was no legislation
governing how they were to be run. Circulars and rules issued from the relevant
department instead. The Rules for National Schools reflect the fact that they
are largely denominational schools.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0051/index.html">Education
Act 1998</a> does not use the term 'national school' and instead uses 'primary'
school. The name is not particularly significant except that 'national school'
clearly indicates that the school is State-aided while a primary school can be
private or State-aided. The following initials are frequently used to describe
schools:</p>

<p>NS - National School </p>

<p>GNS - Girls' National School</p>

<p>BNS - Boys' National School</p>

<p>SN - Scoil Naisiúnta (appears before the name rather than after it)</p>

<p>Some schools use the Irish form of their name but that does not necessarily
mean that they teach through the medium of Irish. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/">Gaelscoileanna</a> are schools that teach
through Irish and they usually, but not invariably, include the word
'Gaelscoil' in their title. Multi-denominational schools sometimes include that
description in their title. </p>

<p>Some primary schools are run by religious orders - they are sometimes called
convent or monastery schools. They operate under the same rules as other
primary schools except for some special rules relating to the appointment of
principals and the choice of teacher representatives on the board of
management.</p>

<p>The Department of Education and Skills lists schools geographically under <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/find-a-school">Find a School</a>. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../../the_irish_education_system/special_education.html">There are
several special schools</a> - including residential care units and schools for
children with disabilities, young offenders, children at risk, children with
specific learning disabilities and emotionally disturbed children. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="ownership_of_primary_schools.html">ownership of
primary schools</a> is quite complex. In general, they are privately owned and
State-funded. While the school ethos is decided by the owners, the operating
rules are largely set by the State. </p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Press-Events/Conferences/Patronage-and-Pluralism-in-the-Primary-Sector/">Forum
on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector</a> was set up in 2011 to
consider how primary school patronage structures might be adapted to reflect
changes in society. Its report was published on 10 April 2012.</p>

<h3>Private primary schools</h3>

<p>Private primary schools receive no State support, nor are they subject to
State control in relation to curriculum, school day, school year, etc. There is
a limited element of State assessment of private schools because the State is
required to ensure that children receive a certain minimum education.</p>

<p>Teachers in private primary schools are not paid by the State and there are
no requirements about their qualifications. </p>

<p>Many private primary <strong>schools do provide the basic curriculum as set
out for national schools but they are not</strong> obliged to do so.</p>

<h3>Choosing a school</h3>

<p>Parents have a <a shape="rect" href="../../the_irish_education_system/constitution_and_education.html">constitutional
right to choose the kind of school</a> to which they want to send their
children and have <a shape="rect" href="../../the_irish_education_system/home_education.html">a right to educate
them at home</a> if they wish.</p>

<p>There is no absolute requirement on schools to admit any particular student.
Schools are required to publish their admissions policy. </p>

<p>Schools are subject to equal status legislation and to the constitutional
requirements on religion. </p>

<h3>Admissions policy</h3>

<p>All primary schools are obliged to publish a school plan that describes
their ethos, admissions policy and objectives. </p>

<p>The admissions policy of most primary schools is fairly straightforward -
they give priority to children from their local area, which, for denominational
schools, is usually the local parish. Admissions problems can arise in
expanding areas where the school cannot cope with extra numbers. Where there is
an accommodation problem, the school must give priority on the basis of their
admissions policy, sometimes called an enrolment policy. This is drawn up by
the <a shape="rect" href="boards_of_management.html">board of management</a>
and should be available to you on request.</p>

<p>Schools run by the minority religions usually give priority to their
co-religionists. The admissions policy for multi-denominational and
non-denominational schools and Gaelscoileanna is decided by each school. The
admissions policy must comply with <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0008/sec0007.html#partii-sec7">section
7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.</a></p>

<p>If a school refuses to enrol your child you may appeal the decision to the
school’s board of management. If this does not succeed you may appeal the
decision to the Department of Education and Skills. More information about this
is in the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/PC22_02.doc">Circular
22/02 Appeals Procedures under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998</a> and in
the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Services/Appeal-against-Permanent-Exclusion-Suspension-or-Refusal-to-Enrol/Appeal-against-Permanent-Exclusion-Suspension-or-Refusal-to-Enrol.html">Department's
section document on appeals procedures</a>. </p>

<p>When choosing a primary school, parents may also need to know about the
admissions policies of secondary schools. Some secondary schools give priority
to the students from certain primary schools. </p>

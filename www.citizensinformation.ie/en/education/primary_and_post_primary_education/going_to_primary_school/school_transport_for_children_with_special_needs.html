<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.education.ie">Department of Education
and Skills</a> provides school transport services for <a shape="rect" href="../../the_irish_education_system/special_education.html">children with
special educational needs.</a> Bus Éireann (the State public transport

to help with the cost of making private transport arrangements. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Services/School-Transport/School-Transport-Schemes/School-Transport-Children-with-Special-Educational-Needs.html">School
Transport Scheme</a> applies to children with a special educational needs
recognised by the Department of Education and Skills. The child must be
attending the nearest recognised mainstream school or special class/special
school or a unit resourced to meet their special educational needs.</p>

<p>If your application has been refused, you are entitled to appeal the
decision. You can appeal to the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Services/School-Transport/School-Transport-Appeals/Contact.html">School
Transport Appeals Board</a> using the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Services/School-Transport/School-Transport-Appeals/School-Transport-Appeal-Form-STA1.pdf">School
Transport Appeal Form (pdf)</a>. Appeals can be made in the following cases:</p>
<ul><li>If the Department is not in a position to provide a transport service due
    to excessive cost </li>
  <li>Where the maximum level of grant offered does not cover the assessed cost
    of the journey involved. </li>
</ul><h3>Escort provision</h3>

<p>Applications can be made to the Department by the Special Educational Needs
Organiser (SENO) to employ an escort to accompany a child, if the child’s
care and safety needs require that support. </p>

<h3>Special class arrangements</h3>

<p>Transport services for children with special needs are only provided for the
period of enrolment in a special class. If the child returns to mainstream
classes, special transport arrangements will not be provided. </p>

<p>Eligible children who are enrolled in an autism class/unit attached to a
mainstream school and who subsequently mainstream in that school will retain
their transport eligibility for the duration of their primary education in this
school. However, a new application must be made if they transfer to a new
school. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0051/index.html">Education
Act 1998</a>, the Minister for Education and Skills may set down the curriculum
for recognised schools. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is a
statutory body, whose function is to advise the Minister of Education and
Skills in matters relating to the curriculum for early childhood education,
primary and post-primary schools, and the assessment procedures employed in
schools and examinations on subjects that are part of the curriculum. This
includes the subjects to be offered, the syllabus for each subject and the
guidance and counselling provision to be offered.</p>

<p>Under the Education Act 1998 the Minister: </p>
<ul><li>Must take into account the desirability of helping schools to provide
    other subjects that the Board of Management thinks are appropriate </li>
  <li>Must take into account the ethos of the school </li>
  <li>Can give directions to schools to ensure that the subjects and syllabuses
    are appropriate and relevant to the educational and vocational needs of
    those schools </li>
  <li>Must ensure that the amount of instruction time given to curriculum
    subjects is sufficient to allow for reasonable instruction in subjects that
    are related to the ethos of the school </li>
  <li>Must not force any student to attend classes in any subject that clashes
    with the beliefs of the parents. </li>
</ul><h3>Content of curriculum</h3>

<p>The revised primary school curriculum was introduced into national schools
in 1999. It consists of 6 curriculum areas that are further divided into 11
subjects. These are:</p>

areas.</p>

<h3>Aims of curriculum</h3>

<p>The aims of the curriculum are to ensure that all children are provided with
learning opportunities that recognise and celebrate their uniqueness, develop
their full potential. The focus is on the child as learner, and the use of a
variety of teaching methodologies is an essential feature of the curriculum.</p>

<p>The curriculum emphasises the need for greater attention to be paid to
students with special educational needs and emphasises the importance of
achieving functional literacy and numeracy. It also draws attention to the
needs of gifted children. </p>

<p>The Department of Education and Skills provides answers to <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/Curriculum-and-Syllabus/Primary-/FAQs.html">frequently
asked questions about the curriculum in primary schools</a>.</p>

<h3>Assessment</h3>

<p>Under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0051/sec0022.html#zza51y1998s22">Article
22</a> of the Education Act schools are obliged to "regularly evaluate students
and periodically report the results of the evaluation to the students and their
parents". In general children's learning and achievement are regularly assessed
in primary schools using a variety of tests and other methods. Circular <a shape="rect" href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0138_2006.doc">0138/2006
Supporting Assessment in Primary School</a>, states how assessment should
carried out. From 2007 all Irish primary schools must administer standardised
tests in English and mathematics to their pupils twice during their primary
school years as follows:</p>
<ul><li>At the end of first class or at the beginning of second class and </li>
  <li>At the end of fourth class or at the beginning of fifth class. </li>
</ul><p>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has published <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ncca.ie/uploadedfiles/publications/assess%20%20guide.pdf">Assessment
in the Primary School Curriculum: Guidelines for Schools (pdf)</a>. It has also
published <a href="http://ncca.ie/en/Curriculum_and_Assessment/Early_Childhood_and_Primary_Education/Primary-Education/Assessment/Leaflets_for_parents/Leaflets_-_Standardised_testing.html">explanatory
leaflets for parents about the standardised tests</a>. </p>

<h3>The structure of the curriculum</h3>

<p>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) provides <a href="http://www.ncca.ie/en/Curriculum_and_Assessment/Parents/Primary/">information
for parents</a> that provides an outline of the broad content and emphases in
the curriculum, as well as advice on how parents can support teaching and
learning at home and in school. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ncca.ie/index.asp?locID=678&amp;docID=-1"></a></p>

<h3>Support for the Primary School Curriculum Programme </h3>

<p><span><strong>National Council for Curriculum and
Assessment</strong></span></p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.ncca.ie/">The National Council for
Curriculum and Assessment</a> was established as a statutory body in July 2001.
Its function is to advise the Minister of Education and Skills in matters
relating to the curriculum for early childhood education, primary and
post-primary schools, and the assessment procedures employed in schools and
examinations on subjects that are part of the curriculum. This includes the
subjects to be offered, the syllabus for each subject and the guidance and
counselling provision to be offered. </p>

<p><strong>Professional development service</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ppds.ie/">Professional Development Service for
Teachers (PDST)</a> in primary schools includes and develops the work of the
former Primary Curriculum Support Programme (PCSP) and School Development
Planning Support (SDPS). PPDS advisors work with schools supporting individual
teachers, groups of teachers and whole staffs in implementation of the primary
school curriculum and in organisational and development planning. </p>

<p><span><strong>School development planning</strong></span></p>

<p>Planning is a statutory requirement for schools under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1998/act/51/section/21/enacted/en/html#sec21">Section
21 of the Education Act 1998</a>. Every school is required to have a school
plan and the boards of management are given responsibility for ensuring that
the plan is prepared, reviewed and regularly updated. A school plan deals with
the curriculum and with the organisation of all the school's resources,
including staff, space, facilities, equipment, time and finance. It also
includes the school's policies on a range of administrative and organisational
issues and, where appropriate, the school's strategies for implementing
official guidelines and regulations. Information about school development
planning in primary schools is available from the Primary Professional
Development Service - see 'Where to apply' below.</p>

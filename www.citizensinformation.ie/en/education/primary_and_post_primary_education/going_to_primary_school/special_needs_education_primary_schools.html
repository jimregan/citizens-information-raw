<p>Children with <a shape="rect" href="../../the_irish_education_system/special_education.html">special
educational needs</a> may be in ordinary classes in mainstream primary schools
or in special classes in these schools. They may get additional educational
support from learning support and resource teachers and care support from
special needs assistants (SNAs).</p>

<p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has published an
information booklet for parents, <a href="http://ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ChildrenWithSpecialEdNeeds1.pdf">Children
with Special Educational Needs (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Learning support/resource teachers</h3>

<p>A learning support teacher service is generally available to all primary
schools. The <a href="http://www.educatetogether.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/learning_support_guidelines.pdf">Learning
Support Guidelines (pdf)</a> published by the Department of Education and
Skills explain the aims and activities of learning support programmes.They
include the procedures for identifying and selecting children who might have
difficulty with reading or mathematics, learning difficulties or special
educational needs and who need supplemental teaching. It is the learning
support teachers who provide this extra teaching – see ‘General
allocation’ below. A learning support teacher service is generally available
to all primary schools. </p>

<p>Further psychological assessment does not occur until the learning support
teacher and the class teacher have tried to address the child’s problems.
Children who continue to have difficulty coping with the curriculum can be
psychologically assessed by the <a shape="rect" href="../educational_supports/national_educational_psychological_service.html">National
Educational Psychological Service</a> and may be eligible for resource teacher
support. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/sp02_05.doc">Department's
Circular Sp Ed 02/05</a> sets out in detail how teaching resources for children
who need additional support in mainstream primary schools are organised. <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0013_2017.pdf">Circular
0013/2017 (pdf)</a> outlines the arrangements for allocation of learning
support and resource teacher posts for 2017/2018.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>General allocation</h3>

<p>Primary schools get a general allocation to meet the needs of children with
high incidence or less severe, more commonly occurring special needs. This
includes specific learning disabilities such as dyslexia and borderline and
mild general learning disabilities. Learning support/resource teachers are
appointed to provide support under the general allocation of additional
teaching resources to help schools to make suitable provision for:</p>
<ul><li>Pupils who are eligible for learning-support teaching </li>
  <li>Pupils with learning difficulties* </li>
  <li>Pupils who have special educational needs arising from high incidence
    disabilities (borderline-mild general learning disability and specific
    learning disability). </li>
</ul><p>* Learning difficulties includes pupils with mild speech and language
difficulties, mild social or emotional difficulties and mild co-ordination or
attention control difficulties associated with identified conditions such as
dyspraxia, attention deficit disorder (ADD), attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD). Pupils with these conditions who have been assessed as being
in the low incidence category get individual support.</p>

<p>Each school decides how the resources for high incidence support are used
and how they are divided among the students who need such support. The
additional teaching may be provided in the classroom or in small separate
groups. Some pupils may need additional one-to-one teaching for a specified
period.</p>

<h3>Additional resources</h3>

<p>The school must make an individual application for resource teaching hours
for children with low incidence or less commonly occurring, more severe special
needs. This includes hearing impairment, visual impairment, moderate general
learning disabilities or autistic spectrum disorders. This application is made
by the school to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) through its
nationwide network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs). The NCSE
publishes <a href="http://ncse.ie/for-schools">guidelines for schools to follow
when applying for resources for pupils with special educational needs</a>.
Additional resource teachers provide individual support to pupils with low
incidence disabilities. The circulars set out the rules for the qualifications
and recruitment of such teachers.</p>

<p>Additional resources will be allocated to schools as an <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Press-Events/Press-Releases/2015-Press-Releases/PR2015-03-24.html">interim
measure to support children with Down Syndrome</a>, who are not already
supported through the National Council for Special Education’s (NCSE) annual
allocation process. Under the interim measure schools will receive 2.5 resource
teacher hours per week for each qualifying child. </p>

<h3>Speech and language disorder</h3>

<p>Special classes for pupils with specific speech and language disorder are
attached to mainstream primary schools. Pupils who meet specific criteria may
be eligible for such classes. The Department's Circular <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0038_2007.doc">0038/2007</a>
sets out the Criteria for Enrolment in Special Classes for Pupils with Specific
Speech and Language Disorder. </p>

<p>Schools may apply to the Special Educational Needs Organiser to establish
these classes. Schools must have at least 5 eligible pupils in order to retain
a class. A full-time teacher is assigned to each special class and the
pupil/teacher ratio is 7:1. Eligible pupils may spend up to 2 years in a
special class. An enhanced capitation grant is paid in respect of each pupil
enrolled in these classes. </p>

<p>The Health Service Executive funds the provision of <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/care_in_your_community/speech_and_language_therapy_services.html">speech
and language therapy services</a> for the children attending these classes. </p>

<p>If a school has such a class and there are places to spare, these places may
be offered to a maximum of 2 pupils who do not meet the eligibility criteria
but who could benefit from enrolment in the class. This must be supported by
the recommendation of a speech and language therapist and/or a psychologist.
</p>

<p>In general, a child who is eligible for placement in a special class is also
eligible for <a shape="rect" href="school_transport_for_children_with_special_needs.html">free transport</a>
to their nearest class. </p>

<p>Pupils who meet the criteria for classes may also qualify for additional
teaching support (even if there is a special class available). You may apply
for this support to the SENO - see 'How to apply' below.</p>

<p>Pupils with mild speech and language difficulties may qualify for teaching
support from the school’s general allocation of teaching resources as
outlined above.</p>

<h3>Autism </h3>

<p>Children on the autistic spectrum may avail of special needs education in
the same way as other children with special needs. There are also specific
provisions for them. </p>

<p>There are a number of special classes for children with autism, which are
attached to special and mainstream schools, as well as several special classes
for children with Asperger’s Syndrome. There are early intervention classes
(attached to some primary schools) for children of pre-school age who are on
the autistic spectrum.</p>

<p>The Home Tuition Scheme funds home programmes for pre-school children on the
autistic spectrum who need early educational intervention. The grant aid is for
10 hours' home tuition a week for children aged 2½ to 3 and 20 hours a week
for children aged 3. The funding is not provided if there is a place in school
or early education available to the child. </p>

<p>There are also a number of stand-alone facilities providing an applied
behavioural analysis (ABA) specific methodology. These facilities were all
recognised as special schools in 2010.</p>

<h3>Dyslexia</h3>

<p>There are 4 special reading schools and special classes attached to some
ordinary primary schools which specifically support the needs of children with
dyslexia. They have a reduced pupil/teacher ratio of 9:1 and an increased level
of capitation grant. </p>

<h3>Hearing impairment</h3>

<p>There are 3 schools for students with hearing impairment and special classes
attached to some mainstream schools. The special classes have a pupil/teacher
ratio of 7:1. There is an enhanced subvention and grant aid towards special
equipment.</p>

<p>There is a weekly home tuition Irish Sign Language Support Scheme for deaf
pre-school children and deaf schoolgoing pupils to provide training in Irish
Sign Language (ISL) for these children, their siblings and parents. </p>

<h3>Home Tuition Programme </h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Services/Home-Tuition/">Home
Tuition Programme</a> provides funding to parents to provide education at home
for children who (for a number of reasons, such as chronic illness) are unable
to attend school. The scheme is also available to children with special
educational needs who are awaiting a suitable educational placement.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0046_2016.pdf">Information
about the Home Tuition scheme is in the Department's Circular 0046/2016
(pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>July Education Programme<a></a></h3>

<p>The July Education Programme is a funding arrangement for schools to provide
further special needs education in the month of July. Special schools and
mainstream primary schools with special classes catering for children with
autism may choose to extend their education services through the month of July.
There is also a July Programme for pupils with a severe/profound general
learning disability. The funding also covers transport and escort services for
the children.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Services/July-Provision/Home-Based.html">information
about the July programme</a> on the Department of Education and Skills
website.</p>

<p>If schools are not participating in the July Education Programme, home
tuition during July is offered as an alternative for the pupils who would
normally attend such schools. </p>

<h3>Visiting Teacher Service</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../educational_supports/visiting_teacher_service_for_children_with_visual_impairments_in_ireland.html">Visiting
Teacher Service</a> provides a teaching and support service to parents and
schools for pupils who have difficulties resulting from hearing disability or
visual impairment. </p>

<h3>Special needs assistants</h3>

<p>Special needs assistants (SNAs) are allocated to schools to work with
children who have specific care needs. They provide non-teaching care support.
SNAs support pupils who have care needs resulting from a disability,
behavioural difficulties or a significant medical issue. This might include a
significant impairment of physical or sensory function or where their behaviour
makes them a danger to themselves or other pupils. Pupils’ needs could range
from needing an assistant for a few hours each week (for example, to help feed
or change the pupil(s) or bring them to the toilet) to requiring a full-time
assistant. </p>

<p>SNAs may work with more than one child and can also work on a part-time
basis depending on the needs of the school. </p>

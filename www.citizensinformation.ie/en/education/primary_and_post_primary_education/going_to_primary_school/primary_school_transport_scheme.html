<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>The school transport scheme provides transport for children who live 3.2 km
or more from their local primary school. The <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/The-Department/Management-Organisation/School-Transport.html">scheme
is funded by the Department of Education and Skills</a>. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Who is eligible?</h3>

<p>In order to qualify for school transport, a child must be aged between 4 and
12 years and living 3.2 km or more from the nearest suitable national
school.</p>

<p><a href="school_transport_for_children_with_special_needs.html">Children
with special needs</a> are also eligible for free transport to and from special
schools and to special classes.</p>

<p>If there are spare seats available, children who are not eligible can be
carried on school transport.</p>

<p>The Department of Education and Skills provide a list of <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Services/School-Transport/FAQs.html">FAQs
about the School Transport Grant</a>.</p>

<h3>Schools</h3>

<p>The Department of Education and Skills decides what the nearest suitable
school is. If a child is attending a school that has more than one teacher and
there is a one-teacher school nearer the home, that fact will not usually
disqualify the child from using the school transport scheme.</p>

<p>Children attending multi-denominational schools or Gaelscoileanna
(Irish-speaking schools) are eligible if they meet the distance requirements to
their school. They are not disqualified because there is another national
school nearer to them. There are also special arrangements for Protestant
children attending Protestant schools and children living in remote areas.</p>

<h3>Pick-up points</h3>

<p>The scheme is not a door-to-door service. Parents/guardians are responsible
for bringing their children to the nearest pick-up point to avail of the
service. Generally routes are planned so pupils don't have to travel more than
2.4 km to their nearest pick-up point.</p>

<p>If there is no school transport service available, you may be able to get a
grant towards the costs of private transport for a child who cannot get to
school without transport due to an illness or disability.</p>

<h3>Establishing and retaining a school transport service</h3>

<p>There must be enough children to use the service. This means that there must
be a daily average (over a school term) of at least 10 eligible children in a
distinct area attending their nearest suitable school.</p>

<h3>Closed or merged schools</h3>

<p>The following rules applied in the school year 2011-2012. </p>
<ul><li>Children in a closed school area who are living <strong>within 3.2
    km</strong> from a ‘school of amalgamation’ are no longer be eligible
    for transport to that school, but they may apply for concessionary
    transport if there are seats available</li>
  <li>Current pupils who are eligible for transport under the Central/Closed
    School Rule (CSR)*, and who live <strong>3.2 km or more</strong> from their
    school of amalgamation will remain eligible for the rest of their primary
    schooling</li>
</ul><p>*In the school year 2010-2011 when 2 or more primary schools merged, the
children for whom the closed school would have been the nearest could only have
transport to the school that was the result of the merger. Under the CSR some
children living less than 3.2 km from such a ‘school of amalgamation’ were
eligible for school transport.</p>

<p>From the 2012-2013 school year, eligibility based on the CSR ceased for all
new pupils entering primary schools. This may mean that where there is now a
school that is nearer than the school of amalgamation, siblings in some
families may have school transport eligibility to different schools from the
2012-2013 school year onward.</p>

<p>The Department of Education and Skills publishes detailed information on <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Services/School-Transport/School-Transport-Schemes/st_primary_scheme.pdf">the
conditions governing the primary school transport scheme (pdf)</a>. </p>

<h3>Remote area grants</h3>

<p>Remote area grants are payable by the Department as a contribution towards
private transport arrangements for eligible pupils for whom no transport
service is available. These grants may also be paid for eligible pupils who
live 3.2 km or more from the nearest pick-up point for school transport.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p><strong><strong>Children eligible for school transport</strong></strong></p>

<p><span>There is a charge of €100 per year for each eligible child, with a
maximum of €220 for each family which only uses the primary school transport
scheme. For families who also have eligible children using the <a href="../going_to_post_primary_school/school_transport.html">post-primary
transport scheme</a>, a maximum of €650 per family per year will be
charged.</span></p>

<p><span>Eligible children who hold a medical card do not have to pay the
charge.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Children not eligible for school transport</strong></span></p>

<p><span>If there are spare seats available, a child who is not eligible can
use school transport at a charge of €100 per year. The maximum annual amount
for a family is €220.</span></p>

<p><span>Children who hold a medical card, but who are not eligible for school
transport, will still have to pay this charge.</span></p>

<p><strong>Payment of charge</strong></p>

<p>In general, the charge is due to be paid in full by the end of July or else
in 2 instalments by the end of July and early December.</p>

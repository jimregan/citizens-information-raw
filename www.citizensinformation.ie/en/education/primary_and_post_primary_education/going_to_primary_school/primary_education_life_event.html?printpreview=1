<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Most children in Ireland start their first-level education in primary
schools (also called <em>national schools)</em> at the age of 4 or 5 years of
age. Legally, children can be enrolled at primary school from the age of 4
upwards and must have started their formal education by the age of 6 years. The
primary school cycle is 8 years long. Schools generally have 2 years of infant
classes, followed by class 1 to class 6. </p>

<p>The primary education sector is made up of different types of primary school
including denominational schools, multi-denominational schools, Irish-speaking
schools (called <em>Gaelscoileanna</em>), special schools and non-State-aided
private primary schools. Education in State primary schools is free of charge.
The current and capital costs of primary schools, including teachers' salaries,
are funded mainly by the Government and supplemented by local contributions.
</p>

<h3>Enrolling your child at primary school<br></h3>

<p>You can send your child to the primary school of your choice, provided there
is a place available for them. Where there is a shortage of places the school
must give priority on the basis of their admissions or enrolment policy. This
is drawn up by the <a shape="rect" href="boards_of_management.html">board of
management</a> and should be available to you on request. You can find out more
about <a shape="rect" href="types_primary_school.html">different types of
primary schools and their admissions policies</a>.</p>

<p>To enrol your child in primary school, you should first <a shape="rect" href="http://www.education.ie/en/find-a-school">check the list of primary
schools in your area</a>. Then you should contact the school of your choice to
see if there is a place available. The school of your choice may place your
child on a waiting list or you may need to contact other schools to find a
place. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="special_needs_education_primary_schools.html">Children
with special educational needs</a> are generally educated in mainstream
schools.</p>

<h3>In school</h3>

<p>The length of the school day in primary school is 5 hours and 40 minutes.
This includes assembly time, roll-call and breaks which are usually around 11am
and 12.30pm. Primary schools may reduce the school day by an hour for children
in their first 2 years at primary school (commonly called <em>junior
infants</em> and <em>senior infants</em>) and in their third year at primary
school (commonly called <em>first class</em>). You can read the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/PC11_95.pdf">Department
of Education and Skills (DES) Circular 11/95 Time in School (Primary)
(pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, primary schools must be open for a minimum of 183 days in each
school year. All schools must close for the months of July and August. <a shape="rect" href="../attendance_and_discipline_in_schools/school_terms_in_primary_and_postprimary.html">Christmas,
Easter and mid-term breaks are standardised</a> in both primary and
post-primary schools. </p>

<p>While students do not have to wear a uniform at primary school, many schools
(in consultation with parents) have introduced school uniforms. Check with your
school about their policy. There is an agreed <a shape="rect" href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0063_2013.pdf">set
of recommendations on school uniform policy.</a> There is also a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/pc13_05.doc">DES
Circular on the weight of schoolbags.</a></p>

<p>The principal is responsible for running the school. Each class has a class
teacher who teaches all subjects to their class. In some smaller schools the
teacher has more than one class. There may be other teachers in the school such
as a <a href="../educational_supports/non_nationals_and_non_english_speakers.html">language
support teacher</a> to help learn English or a learning support teacher to help
children who are having difficulty with the curriculum. Schools set their own
policy in relation to homework.</p>

<p>Children starting school for the first time will be in junior infants class.
If your child has attended school before, the principal, you and the class
teacher will decide together which class your child will be in. Children are
only allowed to repeat a year for educational reasons and in special
situations. You can get more information in the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/pc32_03.pdf">DES
Primary Circular 32/03 Retention of Pupils in Same Grade in Primary Schools
(pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>Under the Education Act 1998 the school must provide reports for each child
and the school must allow parents to have access to their child's school
record. Schools usually hold a parent/teacher meeting during the year. If you
are concerned about your child's progress at any stage during the year, you can
speak to the class teacher. </p>

<h3>Resolving problems<br></h3>

<p>If your child has a problem that you cannot sort out, you can arrange to
speak to the class teacher. If this doesn't resolve the problem you can speak
to the school principal.</p>

<p>If you have a complaint about a teacher or about the school, the first step
is usually to speak to the class teacher. Then, if the complaint is not
resolved, speak to the school principal. The next step is to approach the
chairperson of the school's board of management. </p>

<p>If you have exhausted the school's complaints procedure and are still not
satisfied, you can appeal to the Ombudsman for Children. </p>

<p>If your <a href="http://www.teachingcouncil.ie/en/Professional-Standards/Complaints-about-Registered-Teachers/">complaint
is about a teacher’s fitness to teach</a>, you should first use the
school’s complaints procedure. If you have exhausted this procedure and are
not satisfied with the outcome, you can <a href="http://www.teachingcouncil.ie/en/Professional-Standards/Complaints-about-Registered-Teachers/Making-a-Complaint/">make
a complaint to the Teaching Council</a>.</p>

<p>The Department of Education and Skills has no legal powers to investigate
individual complaints about schools or to instruct schools to follow a
particular course of direction with regard to individual complaints. The
Department provides information on the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Information/Complaints-Bullying-Child-Protection-Discrimination/Parental-Complaints.html">complaints
procedure in primary school</a>. </p>

<h3>Absence and leaving school</h3>

<p>If your child cannot attend school you must tell the school the reason for
the absence. Write a short note to the school to explain why your child was out
and send it in with your child when they go back to school. </p>

<p>If you are changing school you should tell the school that your child is
leaving and will not be returning. You can ask the principal to give you a
report on your child's progress which can be given to the new school when you
are enrolling your child. </p>

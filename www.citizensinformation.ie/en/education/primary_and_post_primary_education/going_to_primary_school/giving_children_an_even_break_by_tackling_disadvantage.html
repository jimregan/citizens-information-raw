<p>The Department of Education and Skills has several schemes aimed at tackling
educational disadvantage in primary schools. Some of these come within the
framework of the Department’s initiative '<a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-/">Delivering
Equality of Opportunity in Schools' (DEIS)</a>. This initiative brings together
a range of <a shape="rect" href="../../the_irish_education_system/measures_to_address_educational_disadvantage.html">national
programmes to address educational disadvantage</a> throughout the school
system. </p>

<h3>School Completion Programme </h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.newb.ie/publications/scpdocumentation.asp">School
Completion Programme (SCP)</a>, introduced in 2002, focuses on young people
between the ages of 4 and 18 years of age. The programme is a support strand
within the <a href="http://www.tusla.ie/services/educational-welfare-services/">Child and
Family Agency</a> under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. It forms
part of the Department of Education and Skills social inclusion strategy <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-/">Delivering
Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS)</a> to help children and young people
who are at risk of or who are experiencing <a href="../attendance_and_discipline_in_schools/school_attendance.html">educational
disadvantage</a>. </p>

<p>School Completion Programme aims to keep young people in the formal
education system to completion of senior cycle or equivalent and to generally
improve the quality of participation and educational attainment. Each project
is managed by a local management committee and provides a tailored programme of
in-school, after school and holiday time interventions to targeted children and
young people who are at risk of early school leaving. The programme provides
flexibility for schools to develop more effective strategies, like
out-of-school support and outreach, family support, mentoring, staff
development and parental involvement.</p>

<h3>School Meals Programme </h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/OperationalGuidelines/Pages/swa_schoolm.aspx">School
Meals Programme</a> is a separate programme funded by the Department of Social
Protection and local authorities. It aims to supplement the diets of
school-going children from disadvantaged backgrounds to help them fulfil their
potential within the educational system and to reduce the risk of early school
leaving. There are two schemes. </p>

<p>The Urban Scheme supports school meals for primary schools in urban areas.
This programme consists of daily sandwiches or buns and milk. The scheme is not
a replacement for home meals. </p>

<p>The Local Projects Scheme gives funding directly to national and secondary
schools, local groups and voluntary organisations, which operate their own
school meals projects (the meals may be hot or cold). In 2004 the scheme was
extended to nursery schools catering for disadvantaged pre-school children.
These meals must be targeted at areas of disadvantage or at children with
special needs. Funding is allocated on the basis of a rate per meal per child.
</p>

<h3>School Milk Scheme</h3>

<p>The School Milk Scheme entitles schoolgoing children to a quarter litre of
milk on each school day. Pre-schools, primary and second-level schools are
eligible for the Scheme, which is funded by the EU and the Irish Government.
Crèches and other childminding concerns which are operated for commercial gain
are not eligible under the <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/agri-foodindustry/marketsupports/othermarketsupportschemes/euschoolmilkschemes/">rules
of the School Milk Scheme</a>.</p>

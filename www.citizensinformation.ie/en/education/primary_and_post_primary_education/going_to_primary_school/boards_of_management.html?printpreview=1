<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p><a shape="rect" href="types_primary_school.html">Primary schools</a> have
had boards of management since 1975. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0051/index.html">Education
Act 1998</a> put the system on a statutory basis and set out the
responsibilities of the boards. </p>

<p>Primary schools are not obliged to have boards of management. <a shape="rect" href="ownership_of_primary_schools.html">The patron of the
school</a> has the right to decide whether or not to have one. In practice,
most primary schools do have boards. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Under the Education Act 1998, the patron is obliged 'for the purposes of
ensuring that a recognised school is managed in a spirit of partnership' to
appoint, where practicable, a board of management. The composition of the board
of management is to be agreed between school patrons, national associations of
parents, school management organisations, teacher representatives and the
Minister for Education and Skills.</p>

<p>The board is appointed by the patron. In making appointments, the patron
must comply with Ministerial directions about gender balance.</p>

<p>If the patron decides that it is not practicable to appoint a board, he/she
must give reasons to the parents, teachers, staff and the Minister but he/she
cannot be forced to appoint one.</p>

<h3>Functions of the board</h3>

<p>The board's main function is to manage the school on behalf of the patron
and for the benefit of the students and to provide an appropriate education for
each student at the school. The board is accountable to the patron and the
Minister for Education and Skills. The school principal is responsible for the
day-to-day management of the school and is accountable to the board.</p>

<p>In carrying out its functions, the board must</p>
<ul><li>Act in accordance with Ministerial policy </li>
  <li>Uphold the ethos of the school and be accountable to the patron for this.
    The word <em>ethos</em> is not used in the Education Act 1998. It is
    described in the Act as the 'characteristic spirit of the school as
    determined by the cultural, educational, moral, religious, social,
    linguistic and spiritual values and traditions which inform and are
    characteristic of the objectives and conduct of the school'. </li>
  <li>Act in accordance with the law and with any deed, charter, or similar
    instrument relating to the school. </li>
  <li>Consult with and inform the patron of decisions and proposals </li>
  <li>Publish the school's policy on admission to and participation in the
    school, including its policy on expulsion and suspension of students,
    admission and participation by students with disabilities or with other
    special educational needs </li>
  <li>Ensure that the school's admissions policy respects the choices of
    parents and the principles of equality and that it complies with
    Ministerial directions, having regard to the school ethos and the
    constitutional rights of all concerned </li>
  <li>Have regard for the principles and requirements of a democratic society
    and promote respect for the diversity of values, beliefs, traditions,
    languages and ways of life in our society </li>
  <li>Have regard to the efficient use of resources (particularly the grants
    provided by the State), the public interest in the affairs of the school
    and accountability to students, parents and the community </li>
  <li>Use the resources provided by the State to make reasonable provision and
    accommodation for students with disabilities or special needs, including,
    if necessary, the adaptation of buildings or provision of special equipment
  </li>
</ul><h3>How boards of management operate</h3>

<p>The role and method of operation of boards of management of primary schools
was agreed by the Department of Education, the school managers, parents and
teachers in 2003. <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/Boards-of-Management/Boards-of-Management-of-National-Schools-Constitution-of-Boards-and-Rules-of-Procedure-2011.pdf">The
Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure (pdf)</a>, revised in 2011, sets
out the key activities of the Board.</p>

<p>Essentially, the board manages the school. Among other things:</p>
<ul><li>It has responsibility for drawing up the school plan and for ensuring
    that it is implemented.</li>
  <li>It appoints the principal, the teachers and other staff.</li>
  <li>It must ensure that the school fulfils its functions as set out in the
    Education Act 1998.</li>
  <li>It must promote contact between the school, the parents and the community
    and must facilitate and give all reasonable help to a parents' association
    in its formation and its activities.</li>
  <li>It has overall responsibility for the school's finances. It is obliged to
    have comprehensive insurance cover for the school. It must keep proper
    accounts, which may be audited by the Department of Education and Skills
    and/or the Comptroller and Auditor General. Its annual accounts must be
    available to the patron and the school community.</li>
  <li>It must ensure that child protection and welfare are taken into account
    in all of the school’s policies, practices and activities. The board must
    ensure that the Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post Primary
    Schools are fully implemented by the school.</li>
  <li>It must ensure the school has a Code of Behaviour and an anti-bullying
    policy.</li>
</ul><p>The board must have a procedure for informing parents about its activities
– this could include an annual report. <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/Boards-of-Management/">More
information on boards of management</a> is available on the website of the
Department of Education and Skills.</p>

<h3>Who is on the board</h3>

<p>The composition of the board of management for schools with more than one
teacher is </p>
<ul><li>Two direct nominees of the patron </li>
  <li>Two parents of children enrolled in the school (one mother and one
    father) elected by the parents </li>
  <li>The principal </li>
  <li>One other teacher elected by the teaching staff. </li>
  <li>Two extra members agreed by the representatives of the patron, teachers
    and parents. </li>
</ul><p>There are particular rules for boards of management for convent and
monastery schools in relation to the teacher representatives. If the principal
is a religious, the elected teacher-member must be a lay person and, if the
principal is a lay person, it is recommended that the elected teacher-member be
a religious. In one-teacher schools, there is one direct nominee of the patron,
one teacher representative, one parent and one extra member proposed by these
nominees.</p>

<p>There are certain criteria set out for choosing the 2 community
representatives on the board of management. </p>
<ul><li>The people appointed must have a commitment to the ethos of the school.
    In the case of Catholic schools, they must have an understanding of and
    commitment to Catholic education as outlined in the Deed of Trust for
    Catholic Schools. For Church of Ireland schools, they must be members of
    that Church; in Presbyterian schools, they must also be church members and
    in Muslim schools they should be members of the Muslim community in Ireland
    (in all cases the patron of the school can decide otherwise). For Educate
    Together schools they must have a commitment to the ethos of the school.
  </li>
  <li>They must have skills that are complementary to the board's requirements
  </li>
  <li>They must be interested in education but normally should not be parents
    of students currently attending the school or teachers currently on the
    staff </li>
  <li>In Gaeltacht schools and Gaelscoileanna, they are expected to have a good
    knowledge of the Irish language. </li>
  <li>The need to maintain a gender balance must be a consideration </li>
</ul><p>The patron appoints the chairman of the board. </p>

<p>The Rules set out in detail how the parents' representatives are to be
chosen, including the notice to be given to all parents, how replacements are
chosen, etc.</p>

<p>In general, members of the board may not hold any interest in the school
property or get paid for serving on the board. The Education Act 1998
explicitly clarifies that being on the board does not confer any property
interest on a board member. Employees, other than the teacher representatives,
may not be on the board.</p>

<p>The following people are not eligible for membership of a board:</p>
<ul><li>A person who is an undischarged bankrupt or was involved in a court
    procedure for settling with creditors in the previous 3 years or </li>
  <li>A person who received a prison sentence in the previous 5 years. </li>
</ul><h3>Term of office of the board</h3>

<p>The term of office for a board is 4 years and members can hold office only
for 4 years although members are eligible for reappointment when their term of
office expires.</p>

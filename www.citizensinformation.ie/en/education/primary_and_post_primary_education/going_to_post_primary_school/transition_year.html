<p>Transition Year (TY) is a one-year school-based programme between Junior
Cycle and Senior Cycle. It is designed to act as a bridge between the two by
facilitating the smooth transition from the more <span>dependent</span>
learning of the Junior Cycle to the more <span>independent</span> self-directed
learning required for the Senior Cycle </p>

<p>All second-level schools have the option of offering the Transition Year
programme to their students and most of them do offer it. The Transition Year
programme follows the <a shape="rect" href="../../state_examinations/junior_certificate_programme.html">Junior
Cycle</a> and is generally seen as the first year of a three-year <a shape="rect" href="senior_cycle.html">Senior Cycle</a> programme. However,
Transition Year is not in fact the first year of the <a shape="rect" href="../../state_examinations/established_leaving_certificate.html">Leaving
Certificate programme</a>, which is a two-year cycle.</p>

<h3>Aims of the Transition Year programme</h3>

<p>The Transition Year offers students an opportunity:</p>
<ul><li>To engage in independent, self-directed learning, </li>
  <li>To develop general, technical and academic skills </li>
  <li>To mature and develop without the pressure of an examination. </li>
</ul><p>You can read the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/Curriculum-and-Syllabus/Transition-Year-/Transition-Year.html">Transition
Year programmes: guidelines for schools</a> on the website of the Department of
Education and Skills.</p>

<p>The Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) has a section on
their website dedicated to providing <a href="http://www.pdst.ie/TY">detailed
information on the Transition Year</a>.</p>

<h3>Areas of study in Transition Year</h3>

<p>Areas of study may include: </p>
<ul><li>Environmental studies</li>
  <li>English</li>
  <li>Maths</li>
  <li>Gaeilge</li>
  <li>Physical education (PE)</li>
  <li>Psychology</li>

</ul><p>You can find more information about the <a href="http://www.pdst.ie/TY/curriculum">TY curriculum</a> on the PDST
website.</p>

<p>Teachers have the chance to design programmes and courses tailored to the
needs and interests of students. Parents, the community and local enterprise
can bring new kinds of learning opportunities to the students. </p>

<p>Students get the opportunity to sample a wide range of subject areas and can
make more informed choices about the kind of Leaving Certificate programme they
want to follow after the Transition Year. Transition Year is optional and
admission criteria vary from school to school. </p>

<h3>Parental involvement in the Transition Year</h3>

<p>When drawing up the Transition Year programme, schools are encouraged to
involve parents in the decision-making process and in the planning. To assist
in the decision-making process, most schools arrange sessions for parents of
third-year students to discuss the Transition Year programme, while a
specifically designed 'Student Introduction to Transition Year' seminar can be
run for the Junior Cycle students themselves. Some parents make their expertise
available to the school during the Transition Year as visiting speakers, others
may assist in the Work Experience Programme while all parents are invited to
contribute to the evaluation of the programme. You can find further information
in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.pdst.ie/node/347">this list of frequently
asked questions on the Transition Year Programme.</a></p>

<h3>Assessment and certification</h3>

<p>There is no end-of-year state examination in the Transition Year - a
decision made by the Department of Education and Skills to ensure that the
focus of the year was learning-led rather than exam-driven. The activity-based
learning ethos of the year requires each school to engage in school-based
assessment, which helps students to identify their own strengths and
weaknesses, as well as develop the skills of self-assessment and reflection.
Assessment is ongoing, with portfolio assessment, project work, and exhibitions
of students' work. Oral aural, practical and written activities all form part
of this assessment process. Since 2000, the Department has issued an official
Transition Year Certificate to participants in addition to schools providing
their own school-based certification. </p>

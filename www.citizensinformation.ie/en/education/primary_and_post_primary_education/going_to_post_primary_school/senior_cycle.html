<p>After completing the Junior cycle and sitting the Junior Certificate
students begin the Senior Cycle programme. The Senior Cycle generally caters
for students from 15 to 18 although the Leaving Certificate is not limited to
post-primary students. The main programmes that students can follow at Senior
Cycle are:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="transition_year.html">The Transition Year</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../state_examinations/established_leaving_certificate.html">The
    Established Leaving Certificate</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../state_examinations/leaving_certificate_applied.html">The
    Leaving Certificate Applied</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../state_examinations/leaving_certificate_vocational_programme.html">The
    Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme.</a> </li>
</ul><p>Not all of these programmes are followed in every school. You must find out
what is available in your school or the school you are thinking of attending.
</p>

<h3>Compulsory subjects</h3>

<p>Within these programmes, there are a number of compulsory subjects. The
subjects that are compulsory vary for different programmes and different types
of school. All third-level courses have minimum subject requirements for entry.
These often include Maths, English and Irish. You should check these minimum
requirements before deciding which subjects to take for the Leaving
Certificate. </p>

<p>Irish is compulsory in most programmes. <a shape="rect" href="../../the_irish_education_system/exemption_from_irish.html">In some very
limited circumstances, a student may not have to study Irish</a>. </p>

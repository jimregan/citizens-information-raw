<p>The Department of Education and Skills provides subsidised school transport
for post-primary pupils who live more than 4.8 kilometres away from the
appropriate school.</p>

<p>Bus Éireann runs the school bus service and the Department of Education and
Skills decides the annual fares. The Department and Bus Éireann determine what
is the relevant school, having regard to ethos, language and the shortest
traversable route from the child’s home.</p>

<p>The service is only provided where there are at least 10 eligible pupils in
a distinct locality that can be economically serviced by a bus route. Even when
a pupil meets the age and distance criteria for school transport, there is no
legal entitlement to transport.</p>

<p>Details of the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Services/School-Transport/School-Transport-Schemes/School-Transport-Post-Primary-Scheme.pdf">Post-Primary
School Transport Scheme (pdf)</a>, which was revised in January 2012, are
published on the Department’s website.</p>

<p>There are some <a href="../going_to_primary_school/school_transport_for_children_with_special_needs.html">special
transport arrangements for pupils with disabilities</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To be eligible for school transport, a student must:</p>
<ul><li>Be enrolled in a recognised post-primary school </li>
  <li>Live 4.8 kilometres or more from the nearest school. </li>
</ul><p>The Department of Education and Skills provide a list of <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Services/School-Transport/FAQs.html">FAQs
about the School Transport Grant</a>.</p>

<h3>Changes from 2012</h3>

<p>The school’s <em>Catchment Boundary Area</em> was used up to 2012-2013 to
determine the eligibility of post-primary pupils for school transport. Under
this system, pupils living more than 4.8 kilometres from the post-primary
school catering for the catchment area where they live are fully eligible for
school transport to their school. Pupils who became eligible for transport
under this arrangement continue to be eligible so long as their circumstances
remain the same, for example where they continue to reside at the same address
and attend the same school. </p>

<p>Since September 2012, pupils who start post-primary school will not be
assessed under the catchment area system. They must be living 4.8 km or more
from the nearest post-primary education centre, having regard to ethos and
language, in order to qualify for transport.</p>

<p>There are also changes for pupils with medical cards - see 'Rates' below.</p>

<h3>Transport arrangements</h3>

<p>Parents must arrange to bring their child to the nearest pick-up point on
the bus route. Generally, bus routes are organised so that no pupil has more
than 3.2 kilometres to travel to a pick-up point.</p>

<p>There is provision for parents to pay for the bus service to be extended to
a closer point, where this is feasible from the point of view of time and where
it would not result in a major disruption to other pupils using the service.</p>

<p>Pupils attending a recognised post-primary school that is not the
post-primary school for their area can use the service if there is room on the
bus, provided they live at least 4.8 kilometres from the school in question.</p>

<p>Pupils may be given transport to enable them to attend the nearest all-Irish
post-primary school or a post-primary school for their particular ethos if they
live at least 4.8 kilometres or more from that school.</p>

<h3>Concessionary transport</h3>

<p>Children who are not eligible for school transport may be allowed to use it
on a concessionary basis and pay the full charge – there is no waiver for
pupils with medical cards. Detailed conditions are published in the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Services/School-Transport/School-Transport-Schemes/School-Transport-Post-Primary-Scheme.pdf">Post-Primary
School Transport Scheme (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Remote area grants</h3>

<p>Remote area grants are payable by the Department as a contribution towards
private transport arrangements for eligible pupils for whom no transport
service is available. These grants may also be paid for eligible pupils who
live 3.2 kilometres or more from the nearest pick-up point for school
transport.</p>

<h3>Standards</h3>

<p>Children using school transport are expected to behave responsibly and to
have regard for their own safety and the safety of others. There are <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Services/School-Transport/Guidelines-for-Discipline-and-Procedures-for-Dealing-with-Alleged-Misbehaviour-on-School-Transport.pdf">guidelines
(pdf)</a> covering the standards expected and how any alleged misbehaviour will
be handled.</p>

<h3>Reduced fares on public transport</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.dublinbus.ie/Fares-and-Tickets/">Dublin Bus</a>, the <a href="http://www.luas.ie/ticket-types-and-fares/">LUAS</a> and the <a href="http://www.irishrail.ie/index.jsp?p=118&amp;n=198">DART</a> offer
concessionary fares during school terms.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>There is a single annual charge of €350 per pupil. The maximum amount for
a family is €650 per year.</p>

<p>In general, the charge is due to be paid in full by the end of July or else
in 2 instalments: by the end of July and the start of December.</p>

<h3>Pupils with medical cards</h3>

<p>Pupils who are eligible for school transport (see above) and who hold a
valid <a href="../../../health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical
card</a> are entitled to free school transport to the nearest school.</p>

<p>If a pupil with a medical card is <strong>not attending the nearest
school</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>In previous years, eligible pupils using school transport to a school
    outside their catchment area could have the charge waived if they held a
    valid medical card. This arrangement will continue for pupils who are
    already availing of the waiver.</li>
  <li>From 2012-2013 on, a medical card holder who is starting to attend a
    post-primary school further away than the nearest education centre will not
    be entitled to free transport to that school.</li>
</ul></div>

<p>Students with <a shape="rect" href="../../the_irish_education_system/special_education.html">special
educational needs</a> may be in ordinary classes in mainstream post-primary
schools or in special classes in these schools or in special schools. They may
get help from learning support/resource teachers and care support from special
needs assistants (SNAs). </p>

<h3>Mainstream schools</h3>

<p>Post-primary students with special educational needs may attend a mainstream
post-primary school. They may be in mainstream classes with the support of a
learning support/resource teacher and/or the care support of a special needs
assistant or may be in a special class. </p>

<p>A school may apply for a grant to make the school accessible for a student
with a disability, for example, to put in a ramp or accessible toilet
accommodation. Information about this provision can be obtained from the
Building Unit of the Department of Education and Skills â€“ see 'How to apply'
below. </p>

<p>The following support services are available for students with disabilities
and special educational needs attending post-primary schools:</p>
<ul><li>Resource teaching </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0030_2014.pdf">Special
    needs assistants scheme (pdf)</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../educational_supports/equipment_grant_special_needs.html">Equipment
    grants</a> </li>
</ul><p>Resource teachers are allocated by the National Council for Special
Education (NCSE) which has issued <a shape="rect" href="http://ncse.ie/for-schools">Information and Guidelines for Second Level
Schools in Processing Applications for Resources for Pupils with Special
Educational Needs (pdf).</a></p>

<p>If a student had additional teaching support in primary school, a formal
assessment or diagnosis is required by the post-primary school when it applies
for additional resource teaching for the student.</p>

<p>You can download <a href="http://ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ChildrenWithSpecialEdNeeds1.pdf">Children

Council for Special Education.</p>

<h3>Dyslexia</h3>

<p>Second-level pupils with dyslexia are normally integrated into ordinary
classes. In such situations, they may receive additional tutorial support from
the learning support teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers. </p>

<h3>Special classes<br></h3>

<p>There are special classes for students with special educational needs
attached to a number of post-primary schools. These classes usually cater for
the learning needs of students with a mild or moderate level of learning
disability.</p>

<h3>Special schools</h3>

<p>There are special schools throughout the country for students with general
learning disabilities. These schools provide education for students from 5 to
18 years who have a general learning disability at a mild or moderate level. In
addition, there are post-primary schools for visually impaired and hearing
impaired students in Dublin. These schools cater for both day students and
boarders. There are a small number of schools for students with physical
disabilities and a small number of special schools for students who have
behavioural and emotional difficulties. </p>

<p>Students usually take the <a shape="rect" href="../../state_examinations/">Junior Certificate and Leaving Certificate
examinations</a>. </p>

<p>The schools also make provision for students whose level of disability would
make it very difficult for them to benefit from the Junior and Leaving
Certificate programmes. In some schools for students with mild learning
disabilities, students may be offered the opportunity to take part of the
Junior Certificate curriculum. </p>

<h3>Examinations</h3>

<p>Students with specific disabilities may be exempt from part of the
examination in a particular subject. In such cases, the certificates awarded
may note that the student has not sat an element of the examination. The
annotation is made where a core area of a subject is not assessed, or where the
mode of assessment used has the same effect. For example, hearing impaired
students may be exempt from the aural component of the examination. The
certificate would note that all elements of the subject were examined except
the aural element. Similarly, students with dyslexia may have spelling and
grammar waivers in language subjects and their certificates would note this.
</p>

<p>The Equality Tribunal ruled in 2006 that this annotation was contrary to the
Equality Acts. On appeal, the Circuit Court found that the system of exemption
and related notation is a reasonable accommodation in the context of the Equal
Status legislation, and in June 2010 the High Court confirmed this finding.
This decision has since been appealed to the Supreme Court. </p>

<p>There are <a shape="rect" href="../../state_examinations/examination_arrangements_for_students_with_disabilities.html">arrangements
in place for reasonable accommodation for students with disabilities sitting
examinations</a>.</p>

<h3>Further education and training</h3>

<p>The National Council for Special Education has published a <a href="http://ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/NCSE-Post-School-Education-Training.pdf">guide
to post school education and training (pdf)</a> which provides information on
the options available to school leavers with disabilities. </p>

<p>The post-primary or second-level education caters for students aged 12 to 18
years. Attendance at school is compulsory for students aged under 16. Most
children start in post-primary school at the age of 12 or 13. They must be at
least 12 years of age on 1 January in the year they start second-level
education in order to be registered in a post-primary school. There are
different <a shape="rect" href="types_of_post_primary_school.html">types of
post-primary school</a>. </p>

<h3>Choosing a post-primary school </h3>

<p>In most rural and provincial areas, there is generally one school that is
attended by all the students in that area. However, some parents and students,
especially in large population centres, may have a choice of schools. The
factors to consider when choosing a school include:</p>
<ul><li><strong>The admissions policy</strong>: This should be described in the
    school plan, which the school is obliged to publish </li>
  <li><strong>The curriculum:</strong> the range of subjects offered by the
    school </li>
  <li><strong>School discipline:</strong> Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2000/en.act.2000.0022.pdf">Education
    (Welfare) Act 2000</a> (pdf) the board of management is obliged to draw up
    a code of behaviour for students </li>
  <li><strong>Programmes offered</strong>: Junior Certificate and Junior
    Certificate School Programme, Transition Year, established Leaving
    Certificate, Leaving Certificate Applied, the Leaving Certificate
    Vocational and other programmes to support personal and social development
  </li>
  <li><strong>Streaming of students:</strong> Streaming students means dividing
    them into different classes for all subjects from the time they start
    secondary school, based on the school's assessment of their ability. </li>
  <li><strong>Assessment of students' progress and feedback to parents and
    students:</strong> Checking of students' progress, feedback to parents,
    arrangements for parent-teacher meetings </li>
  <li><strong>Facilities:</strong> What student facilities are provided, for
    example a library, access to computers, a language laboratory and
    facilities for lunch, PE and recreation. </li>
  <li><strong>Support services:</strong> guidance counsellor, remedial support
    for students, pastoral care </li>
  <li><strong>Extra-curricular activities</strong>: sports, clubs, debating
    etc. </li>
  <li><strong>Other factors</strong> including the school ethos (details should
    be in the school plan); student and parental involvement in life of school
    - whether it has a student council and/or a parents' association </li>
</ul><h3>Enrolling your child at post-primary school</h3>

<p>You can send your child to the post-primary school of your choice, provided
there is a place available. Where there is an accommodation problem, the school
must give priority on the basis of its enrolment policy. This is drawn up by
the board of management and should be available to you on request. While most
post-primary schools are in a position to enrol all children who apply, there
is no automatic guarantee of a place in the school you choose. </p>

<p>In order to enrol your child, you should first check <a shape="rect" href="http://www.education.ie/en/find-a-school">the list of post-primary
schools in your area</a>. Then, you should contact the school of your choice to
see if there is a place available. The school of your choice may place your
child on a waiting list or you may need to contact other schools to find a
place. </p>

<p>The Department of Education and Skills held a <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Information/School-Enrolment/">consultation
on the options for the regulation of school enrolment</a>.</p>

<h3>Starting post-primary education</h3>

<p>The vast majority of post-primary schools do not charge fees. However,
students must pay for books and examination fees. In addition, there are other
costs, such as school uniform. There are schemes to help low-income families
meet the <a shape="rect" href="../educational_supports/school_books_scheme.html">costs of schooling.</a>
The Department of Education and Skills has published a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/m35_05.doc">circular
on the weight of schoolbags</a>.</p>

<p>Second-level education consists of a three-year <a shape="rect" href="junior_cycle.html">Junior Cycle,</a> followed by a two-year or three-year
Senior Cycle. The <a shape="rect" href="../../state_examinations/junior_certificate_programme.html">Junior
Certificate Programme</a> examination is taken at the end of the Junior Cycle.
In the <a shape="rect" href="senior_cycle.html">Senior Cycle</a>, there is an
optional one-year <a shape="rect" href="transition_year.html">Transition
Year</a> programme followed by a choice of three Leaving Certificate
programmes. Each of these 3 Leaving Certificate programmes - the <a shape="rect" href="../../state_examinations/established_leaving_certificate.html">Established
Leaving Certificate</a>, the <a shape="rect" href="../../state_examinations/leaving_certificate_applied.html">Leaving

<p>There are a number of different types of post-primary school in the Irish
education system, which allow a measure of choice to parents. The second-level
sector comprises voluntary secondary schools, community schools and
comprehensive schools, which are generally denominational (for example, Roman
Catholic or Protestant). Vocational schools and community colleges are
non-denominational.</p>

<h3>Voluntary secondary schools</h3>

<p>Voluntary secondary schools are privately owned and managed. They are under
the trusteeship of religious communities, boards of governors or individuals.
The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0051/index.html">Education
Act 1998</a> requires secondary schools to have boards of management that
include parent and teacher representatives. The national organisation
representing the boards of management of these schools is the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.jmb.ie/">Joint Managerial Body</a>. Voluntary secondary
schools may be fee-paying or non-fee-paying. Fee-paying schools are not
eligible for Government funding to assist with running costs. Non-fee-paying
schools that participate in the free education scheme get a range of grants and
subsidies from the State. In the past, voluntary secondary schools provided a
more academic education but increasingly, they provide a range of academic,
practical and vocational subjects.</p>

<h3>Vocational schools and community colleges</h3>

<p>Vocational schools and community colleges are owned by the local <a href="http://www.etbi.ie/etbs/second-level-education/">Education and Training
Board (ETB)</a>. The boards of management for these schools are sub-committees
of the ETB. Membership of the boards include ETB representatives and parent,
teacher and community representatives. Vocational schools and community
colleges are largely funded by the Department of Education and Skills.
Initially, these schools were orientated towards providing a technical
education and developing manual skills. Today, they generally provide a wide
range of both academic and practical subjects. Vocational schools are also the
main providers of adult education and community education courses. The national
representative body for the Education and Training Boards is the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.etbi.ie/">Education and Training Boards
Ireland.</a></p>

<h3>Community and comprehensive schools</h3>

<p>Community and comprehensive schools were established in the 1960s in order
to provide a broad curriculum for all the young people in a community. Many of
these schools were established as the result of the amalgamation of voluntary
secondary and vocational schools. They offer a wide range of both academic and
vocational subjects. They are managed by boards of management which are
representative of local interests. The schools are financed entirely by the
Department of Education and Skills. The representative body for these schools
is the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.accs.ie/">Association of Community and
Comprehensive Schools.</a></p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The Education Act 1998 makes certain requirements of each secondary
school’s board of management:</p>

<h3>Admissions policy</h3>

<p>The board of management of each school must devise its own admissions policy
and make this information available to parents. Such policies should include
the provision of services for <a shape="rect" href="post_primary_education_for_students_with_special_needs.html">children
with special educational needs</a> and respect for the rights of parents to
send their children to a school of their choice. Parents should know the
criteria used in selecting or rejecting children for enrolment. Schools are
allowed to following their religious and educational philosophy when developing
an admissions policy. They cannot however refuse admittance to a student unless
that refusal is in accordance with their stated policy and does not
discriminate under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0008/index.html">Equal
Status Acts 2000–2011</a>. Parents can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Services/Appeal-against-Permanent-Exclusion-Suspension-or-Refusal-to-Enrol/">appeal
a decision to refuse enrolment to the Department of Education and Skills</a>.
The appeal must be made within 42 calendar days from the date that the decision
of the board of management was notified to the parents/guardians.</p>

<h3>School plan</h3>

<p>The board of management must produce a school plan. This sets out the
long-term vision of the school, its goals and action plans, and its policies
and procedures. It includes information on the school’s curriculum, resources
and facilities, and opportunities for students and others to participate in the
school community. It should also contain the school’s objectives relating to
equality of access, participation in the school and provision for students with
disabilities or who have other special educational needs.</p>

<h3>Code of behaviour<br></h3>

<p>Almost all schools will have a written <a shape="rect" href="../attendance_and_discipline_in_schools/school_discipline.html">code of
discipline or student behaviour</a> and a set of rules with which pupils are
expected to comply. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p><strong>Non-fee-paying schools<br></strong>The majority of post-primary schools in Ireland do not charge fees.
Non-fee-paying voluntary secondary schools receive grants from the Department
of Education and Skills to assist with their running costs. Grants are based on
the number of pupils attending the school. <a shape="rect" href="../../the_irish_education_system/measures_to_address_educational_disadvantage.html">Schools
rated as disadvantaged</a> receive an additional grant per pupil. Some
voluntary secondary schools are fee-paying but the majority participate in the
free education scheme. This means they benefit from additional state allowances
and capitation grants. Community and comprehensive schools and vocational
schools are all funded on the basis of an annual budget.</p>

<p><strong>Fee-paying schools</strong><br>
There are a number of fee-paying secondary schools. Fee-paying schools do not
receive any state grants towards their running costs although the State pays
the salaries of all teachers working in recognised schools. Fees are set each
year by the board of management of the school, subject to approval by the
governing body. </p>

<p><strong>School costs</strong><br>
Even students attending non-fee-paying schools must pay for books and
examination fees. In addition, there are other costs, such as school uniform.
There are <a shape="rect" href="../educational_supports/school_books_scheme.html">various schemes to help
low-income families meet the costs of schooling</a>. </p>

<p>The Junior Cycle covers the first three years of secondary school. Children
begin their second-level education around the age of 12 or 13. The <a shape="rect" href="../../state_examinations/junior_certificate_programme.html">Junior
Certificate examination</a> is held at the end of the Junior Cycle in
post-primary schools and students normally sit the exam at the age of 15 or
16.</p>

<p>Twenty-six subjects are currently available but not all schools offer them.
You can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/Curriculum-and-Syllabus/Junior-Cycle-/">view
the Junior Cycle syllabus and curriculum information</a> here. All students
must follow courses in Irish (except where <a shape="rect" href="../../the_irish_education_system/exemption_from_irish.html">that student
is exempt from studying Irish</a>), English, mathematics and civic, social and
political education. There may be other compulsory subjects, depending on the
type of school. </p>

<h3>The Junior Certificate School Programme</h3>

<p>The Junior Certificate School Programme (JCSP) has been designed to help
young people who are at risk of leaving school early and who would benefit from
special support when they are working towards the Junior Certificate. </p>

<p>Schools that offer the programme are given extra resources in order to
facilitate teachers to develop a team approach to supporting the students. </p>

<p>Students taking the Junior Certificate examination study the normal Junior
Certificate syllabus. All students participating in the Junior Certificate
School Programme must be entered for the Junior Certificate examination. All
JCSP students are entitled to a profile - this is an individualised record of
their achievement. This profile is in addition to the Junior Certificate. </p>

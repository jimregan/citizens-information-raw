<p>Schools in Ireland are obliged to open for 183 days per year at <a shape="rect" href="../going_to_primary_school/primary_education_life_event.html">primary
level</a> and 167 days per year at <a shape="rect" href="../going_to_post_primary_school/post_primary_education_life_event.html">post-primary
level</a>. At one time, schools had a good deal of flexibility about the start
and end of school terms. This meant that there was considerable variation about
when students returned to school after holidays such as Christmas and mid-term
breaks. </p>

<p>Since 2004 school terms have been standardised under a series of agreements
made between representatives of schools, teacher unions, parentsâ€™
organisations and other relevant bodies. </p>

<p>The dates for the start and the end of the school year <strong>are not
standardised</strong> so schools have some discretion about when students
finish school in the summer and when they start school in the autumn. All
schools are closed for July and most (or all) of August. The dates for the
Christmas, Easter and mid-term breaks are standardised. </p>

<p>At the start of the school year, parents/guardians will get a list of days
that the school will be closed during the year, including holidays and training
days for teachers. If there are other unexpected closures the school will let
you know in advance.</p>

<p>The Department of Education and Skills <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0016_2014.pdf">Circular
0016/2014</a> deals with the standardisation of the school year 2016/2017. <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0009_2017.pdf">Circular
0009/2017</a> deals with the standardisation of the school years from 2017/2018
to 2019/2020. The circulars also provides guidance about how schools can make
up any time that is lost due to unforeseen closures.</p>

<h3>Start and end of the school year</h3>

<p>The dates for the start and the end of the school year at both primary and
post-primary level are not fixed. However, due to the start of <a shape="rect" href="../../state_examinations/">certificate exams</a>, post-primary schools
are usually not open for tuition after the Friday before the June public
holiday (the first Monday in June) in any year. The school year generally
starts in the week in which 1 September falls . </p>

<h3>Discretionary days</h3>

<p>Every school must be open for tuition for a minimum of 183 days at primary
level and 167 days at post-primary level. Schools can use any remaining days at
their discretion to extend the summer holiday period or to close on religious
or other holidays. </p>

<p>However, schools cannot use these days to extend the Christmas, Easter or
mid-term breaks (unless a religious observance day(s) falls at that time for
schools of a particular denomination or faith). If a school does not have
enough discretionary days left for a religious holiday, it can denote that day
a non-tuition day. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>There are rules regarding bullying between students at primary and
post-primary schools. These are set down in procedures (but not law) issued by
the Department of Education and Skills. The following sets out the rules about
bullying in schools and the rights of pupils and parents where bullying
occurs.</p>

<p>In September 2013 the Department published <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Publications/Policy-Reports/Anti-Bullying-Procedures-for-Primary-and-Post-Primary-Schools.pdf">Anti-Bullying
Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools (pdf)</a> – see below. The
procedures include the requirement that all schools should have an
anti-bullying policy within the framework of their overall <a href="school_discipline.html">code of behaviour</a>. These procedures
replace the 1993 <a shape="rect" href="http://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Information/Complaints-Bullying-Child-Protection-Discrimination/Guidelines-on-countering-bullying-behaviour-in-primary-and-post-primary-schools.pdf">Guidelines
on Countering Bullying Behaviour in Primary and Post Primary Schools (pdf)</a>
- see below. </p>

<p>According to <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/Publications/ChildrenFirst.pdf">Children
First: National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children (pdf)</a>
issued by the Department of Health, teachers have a general duty of care to
ensure that arrangements are in place to <a href="child_abuse.html">protect
children and young people from harm</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="le11ee">What is bullying?</h2>

<p>Bullying is defined by the Department of Education and Skills guidelines as
unwanted negative behaviour, verbal, psychological or physical, conducted by an
individual or group against another person (or persons) and which is repeated
over time. Placing a once-off offensive or hurtful public message, image or
statement on a social network site or other public forum where that message,
image or statement can be viewed and/or repeated by other people is also
regarded as bullying behaviour.</p>

<p>Bullying can occur at any age, in any environment, and can be long or
short-term.</p>

<h3>Cyberbullying</h3>

<p>Cyberbullying is bullying through the internet or mobile phone, often
through social networking sites used by young people. A booklet <a href="http://www.internetsafety.ie/Website/OIS/OISWeb.nsf/page/DPCY-7LYJ4V1343473-en/%24File/GWIT_Cyberbullying_Dec12.pdf">GET
WITH IT! A guide to cyberbullying (pdf)</a> has been produced as a joint
initiative between the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.internetsafety.ie/">Office for Internet Safety</a>, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ncte.ie/">National Centre for Technology in
Education</a> and <a shape="rect" href="http://www.barnardos.ie/">Barnardos.</a> The booklet is intended to
increase awareness of all aspects of cyberbullying including how to identify it
and how to prevent it.</p>

<h3>Effects of bullying </h3>

<p>Many children who are being bullied are afraid to speak out. They are scared
of reprisals if they tell someone. Reports have shown that as young people grow
older, they are less likely to tell someone. They become more and more
isolated, experience depression and, in extreme cases, can harm themselves or
attempt suicide.</p>

<h3>Signs of bullying</h3>
<ul><li>Fear of going to school </li>
  <li>Poor or deteriorating schoolwork, inability to concentrate </li>
  <li>Withdrawn behaviour </li>
  <li>Depression </li>
  <li>Loss of confidence </li>
  <li>Reluctance to go out </li>
  <li>Shortage of money </li>
  <li>Torn clothes, broken glasses, missing schoolbooks </li>
  <li>Repeated signs of bruising and injuries </li>
</ul><h3>Why do people bully?</h3>

<p>Very often, bullies are themselves suffering from low self-esteem and lack
of confidence. They may suffer violence at home. In other cases, they may be
reacting to painful changes in their lives, for example, bereavement or
divorce. They may want to seek attention or to appear in control. If you think
your child might be a bully it is important to recognise this and help him or
her to deal with it. You should talk to the class teacher about this bullying
behaviour and how it could be changed.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="le8ec9">Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and
Post-Primary Schools</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Publications/Policy-Reports/Anti-Bullying-Procedures-for-Primary-and-Post-Primary-Schools.pdf">Anti-Bullying
Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools (pdf)</a> published by the
Department of Education and Skills require that an anti-bullying policy should
be part of the written code of behaviour in all schools. Each school must
follow these procedures when developing its anti-bullying policy. The main
elements of the procedures include:</p>
<ul><li>Strong emphasis on the prevention of bullying behaviour through the
    fostering and development of a positive school culture and climate, based
    on inclusivity and respect and practical tips on how to achieve this</li>
  <li>A school-wide approach to preventing and tackling bullying behaviour</li>
  <li>All schools must adhere to the standard template for developing their
    anti-bullying policy</li>
  <li>Schools must publish their anti-bullying policy on the school’s website
    and give it to the parents’ association</li>
  <li>Making clear that the definition of bullying includes cyber-bullying and
    identity-based bullying (such as homophobic and racist bullying)</li>
  <li>Clear procedures for investigating, recording and dealing with
  bullying</li>
  <li>Oversight arrangements that involve the school principal reporting
    regularly to the Board of Management and a requirement for the Board to do
    an annual review of the school’s anti- bullying policy and its
    implementation</li>
</ul><p>The Department’s Circular <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0045_2013.pdf">0045/2013
(pdf)</a> requires all schools to have developed and formally adopted an
anti-bullying policy that complies with the above procedures by the end of the
second term of the 2013/14 school year. </p>

<p>The Department of Education and Skills has also published guidelines for
teachers on child abuse and bullying: <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/Child-Protection/cp_procedures_primary_post_primary_2011.pdf">Child
Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools (pdf)</a>. These
guidelines reflect the particular circumstances of primary and post-primary
schools and are based on the recommendations of the 'Children First' report.

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld9fb3">How is bullying stopped?</h2>

<p>Intervention from adults is usually necessary. Bullying behaviour must be
challenged or it will become regular and get worse. If you think someone is
being bullied, you should provide opportunities for them to talk to you. It
will take time, but if you send a clear message that bullying is unacceptable
and does not have to continue, in time, the young person may trust you enough
to tell. If you think your child is being bullied you should talk to the class
teacher or the principal. If, for whatever reason, the matter cannot be
resolved by the school staff, you may report the matter to the Chairperson of
the school’s Board of Management for attention. The Board of Management is
legally responsible for the day to day running of the school and has a duty of
care to its school's students. The school’s Board of Management in turn is
responsible to the <a href="../going_to_primary_school/ownership_of_primary_schools.html">school
patron</a> for the exercise of its duties under the Education Act 1998.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/">Department of Education and
Skills</a> can advise you on how to proceed with a complaint. The Department of
Education and Skills itself does not have any power to investigate
complaints.</p>

Department, please contact the Parents’ and Learners’ Section - see 'Where

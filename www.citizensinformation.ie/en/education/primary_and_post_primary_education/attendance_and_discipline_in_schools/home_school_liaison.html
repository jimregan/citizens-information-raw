<p>The Home School Community Liaison Scheme was established in 1990. Teachers
were initially appointed as liaison officers in a number of primary schools
throughout the State in areas of urban disadvantage. In 1991 the scheme was
extended to post-primary schools. You can find information about the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/Home-School-Community-Liaison-HSCL-Scheme/HSCL.html">Home
School Community Liaison Scheme</a> on the Department of Education and Skills
website. The Home School Community Liaison is managed by the <a href="http://www.tusla.ie/">Child and Family Agency</a>.</p>

<h3>Aims</h3>

<p>The aims of the liaison scheme are:</p>
<ul><li>To maximise the participation of the children in the learning process, in
    particular those who might be at risk of failure. </li>
  <li>To promote active co-operation between home, school and relevant
    community agencies in promoting the educational interests of the children.
  </li>
  <li>To raise awareness in parents of their own capacities to enhance their
    children's educational progress and to assist them in developing relevant
    skills. </li>
  <li>To enhance the children's uptake from education, their retention in the
    educational system, their continuation to post-compulsory education and to
    third level and their attitudes to life-long learning. </li>
  <li>To disseminate the positive outcomes of the scheme throughout the school
    system generally. </li>
</ul><p>The scheme is targeted at students who are at risk of not reaching their
potential in the educational system because of economic or social
disadvantage.</p>

<p>A National Co-ordinator and Assistant National Co-ordinators advise on and
support the development of the scheme, liaise with participants at local level
and provide a link between local and national levels.</p>

<p>The home school liaison co-ordinator has access to specific funding and this
is provided by the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/">Department of
Education and Skills</a>.</p>

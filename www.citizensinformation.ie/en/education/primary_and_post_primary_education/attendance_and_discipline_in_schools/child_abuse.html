<p>The Department of Health published the Children First: National Guidelines
for the Protection and Welfare of Children report in 1999. In 2011, the
Department of Children and Youth Affairs updated the <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/Publications/ChildrenFirst.pdf">Children
First Guidelines (pdf)</a>. This report stated that teachers in Ireland have a
general duty to ensure that children and young people are protected from harm.
The report also maintains that teachers need to help young people to develop
their self-esteem, confidence, independence of thought and the necessary skills
to cope with possible threats to their personal safety both within and outside
the school. The <a href="http://www.staysafe.ie/">stay safe programme</a>
assists teachers working with children in primary school.</p>

<p>Since the publication of this report the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Information/Child-Protection/Child-Protection.html">Department
of Education</a> has published guidelines for teachers. These guidelines
reflect the particular circumstances of primary schools, post-primary schools
and community or voluntary organisations and are based on the recommendations
of the Children First guidelines: <a shape="rect" href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/Child-Protection/cp_procedures_primary_post_primary_2011.pdf">Child
Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools (pdf)</a> </p>

<p>Here we summarise the principles that apply to the protection of children
and the responsibilities of school management and staff.</p>

<h3>Responsibilities of school management</h3>

<p>School managers in primary and post-primary schools should:</p>
<ul><li>Plan, develop and implement an effective child protection programme </li>
  <li>Monitor the effectiveness of the programme </li>
  <li>Implement agreed reporting procedures </li>
  <li>Plan and implement appropriate staff development and training
  programmes.</li>
</ul><p>The Board of Management is responsible for:</p>
<ul><li>Having clear procedures which teachers and other school staff must follow
    where they suspect, or are alerted to, possible child abuse, including
    where a child discloses abuse </li>
  <li>Having a Designated Liaison Person (DLP) in place for dealing with child
    protection concerns. The name of the DLP should be displayed in a prominent
    position near the main entrance to the school</li>
  <li>Monitoring the progress of children considered to be at risk </li>
  <li>Promoting in-service training for teachers and members of <a shape="rect" href="../going_to_primary_school/boards_of_management.html">boards of
    management</a> to ensure that they have a good working knowledge of child
    protection issues and procedures </li>
  <li>Having clear written procedures in place concerning action to be taken
    where allegations are made against schools employees</li>
  <li>Reviewing the school’s child protection policy annually.</li>
</ul><h3>Personal responsibilities of school staff</h3>
<ul><li>If a child tells a teacher or other member of school staff that a
    parent/carer or any other person is harming him/her, the person who
    receives the information should listen carefully and supportively. This
    applies where the child implies that he/she is at risk of being harmed by a
    parent/carer or any other person. It also applies if a parent/carer or any
    other person discloses that he/she has harmed or is at risk of harming a
    child </li>
  <li>The child or young person should not be interviewed formally </li>
  <li>The teacher or staff member should obtain only the necessary relevant
    facts </li>
  <li><span>The teacher or staff member should never promise confidentiality to
    a person making a disclosure</span> and should explain why they are
    required to report the disclosure in a supportive way </li>
  <li>The discussion should be recorded accurately and the record should be
    kept </li>
  <li>The teacher or other staff member should then tell the Designated Liasion
    Person who is responsible for <a href="http://www.tusla.ie/children-first/report-a-concern/">reporting the
    matter to the Child and Family Agency (Tusla)</a> or An Garda Síochána.
  </li>
</ul><p>Under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0049/sec0004.html#zza49y1998s4">Section
4</a> of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0049/index.html">Protection
for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act, 1998</a>, nobody will be penalised for
making a report of child abuse in good faith to the Child and Family Agency or
the Gardaí. If you have been penalised, you can <a href="http://www.lrc.ie/documents/work/forms/ProtectionofPersonsReportingChildAbuse.pdf">make
a complaint under the Protection for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998
(pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0022/index.html">Education
(Welfare) Act 2000</a> sets out the law in relation to discipline in State
primary and post-primary schools. Under the Act the board of management of the
school is obliged to draw up a code of behaviour for students stating the
disciplinary rules and procedures.</p>

<p>Codes are drawn up with input from teachers, parents and the educational
welfare officer. (Educational welfare officers work for the <a href="http://www.tusla.ie/services/educational-welfare-services/">Child and
Family Agency</a> and they help co-ordinate all policies concerning both <a shape="rect" href="school_attendance.html">attendance </a>and broader
educational welfare.)</p>

<h3>Code of behaviour</h3>

<p>A code of behaviour must lay down the:</p>
<ul><li>Types of behaviour by the student that may need disciplinary measures
  </li>
  <li>Nature of the disciplinary measures to be carried out </li>
  <li>Procedures to be followed before a student is suspended or expelled </li>
  <li>Grounds for lifting a suspension. </li>
</ul><p>There are <a shape="rect" href="http://www.tusla.ie/uploads/content/guidelines_school_codes_eng.pdf">Guidelines
for Schools on Developing a Code of Behaviour (pdf)</a> and <a href="http://www.tusla.ie/services/educational-welfare-services/information-for-schools-inc-absence-reporting/guidelines-on-codes-of-behaviour">information
about the Guidelines on the Agency's website</a> on the Agency's website.</p>

<p>When a child is becoming a student at the school, the principal must give a
copy of the code to the parents and may require that the parents agree to make
all reasonable efforts to ensure that the child complies with the code.</p>

<p>Department of Education and Skills guidelines recommend that the prevention
of bullying should be a fundamental part of a written code of behaviour and
discipline in all schools.</p>

<p>Schools have considerable independence in the area of discipline. However,
they must use fair procedures. This includes hearing the student's case. </p>

<p>Most schools already have a code of behaviour that sets out how students
will punished for breaching it. It is assumed that parents agree to the
punishments set out in the code if they are told about the code when their
child starts school. As a result, if the punishment is detention, the parents
or student cannot claim that the student has been falsely imprisoned. </p>

<h3>Suspension</h3>

<p>If there has been serious misbehaviour, the school may decide to suspend a
student. This decision is made only after all other disciplinary measures have
been tried. The school will notify the parents of the suspension. The parents
may appeal this decision to the board of management and as a last resort to the
Department of Education and Skills.</p>

<h3>Expulsion</h3>

<p>Before a student is expelled, the educational welfare officer must be told.
The educational welfare officer may then try to find a solution. The student
cannot be expelled until 20 days after the educational welfare officer has been
notified about the case.</p>

<h3>Appeals </h3>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0051/index.html">Education
Act 1998</a> the Minister can, after consultations with the education partners,
set out procedures whereby a parent can appeal against a decision of a teacher
or other staff member to the board of management. These procedures can also be
used by parents or students who have complaints (except for expulsions). </p>

<h3>Appeals to the Department of Education and Skills </h3>

<p>Under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0051/sec0029.html#zza51y1998s29">Section
29</a> of the Education Act 1998 if a Board of Management expels a student or
suspends a student or refuses to enrol a student then the parent may appeal
that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and
Skills (DES) and the appeal will be heard by an appeals committee - see 'How to
apply' below.</p>

<p>The procedures for the hearing of appeals must ensure that:</p>
<ul><li>The parties are helped to reach agreement, if possible </li>
  <li>The appeal is conducted in the most informal way possible. </li>
  <li>Appeals are dealt with within 30 days, but the Secretary General may
    extend the time by a further 14 days. </li>
</ul><p>If the appeals committee upholds a complaint or believes that a matter arose
that needs to be remedied, it must make recommendations to the Secretary
General about the action required. The Secretary General must give reasons for
the decision of the appeals committee and, if it has made a recommendation, may
give directions to the board on how to resolve the issue. </p>

<p>The Child and Family Agency has the right to appeal in cases where the board
of management expels a student or refuses to enrol a student. In cases where
the parent appeals the Agency is able to make submissions to the appeals
committee. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2007/a0907.pdf">Education
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2007 (pdf),</a> which is not yet in effect,
amends Section 29 of the Education Act. Its provisions will require the appeals
committee when they are deciding a case to take account of the educational
interests of other students in the school as well as those of the student who
is the subject of the appeal. The Act will also entitle the National Council
for Special Education to make submissions to an appeals committee.</p>

<h3>Corporal punishment</h3>

<p>Under Section 24 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0026/index.html">Non-Fatal
Offences Against the Person Act 1997</a>, corporal punishment of students may
be a crime. However, Sections 18 and 20 of the Act permit the justifiable use
of force in certain circumstances, for example, self defence or defence of
others.</p>

<h3>Primary schools</h3>

<p>School discipline in primary schools is also regulated by the Department's
<a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/m33_91.doc">Guidelines
towards a Postive Policy for School Behaviour and Discipline</a> which contains
a Suggested Code of Behaviour and Discipline for National Schools and Rule 130
(as amended by Circular 7/88) of the Rules for National Schools. </p>

<h3>Second-level schools</h3>

<p>Discipline in second-level schools is also regulated by the Department's <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/m33_91.doc">Guidelines
Towards a Positive Policy for School Behaviour and Discipline</a>. It contains
a suggested code of discipline and was circulated to the management of all
post-primary schools in 1991.</p>

<h3>National Behaviour Support Service</h3>

<p>In 2006 a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nbss.ie/index.php">National
Behaviour Support Service (NBSS)</a> was set up to help second-level schools
deal with disruptive behaviour. The service works with selected schools that
have significant discipline problems. The NBSS operates through 4 regional
behaviour support teams. A team of professionals, including psychologists,
works intensively with a school over a period of time to help identify the
school's problems and improve student behaviour. In some cases the team may
recommend setting up a behaviour support classroom in a school. <br></p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>The legislation governing school attendance in Ireland is the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0022/index.html">Education
(Welfare) Act 2000.</a> Under the Act the minimum school leaving age is raised
to 16 years (was 15), or the completion of three years of post-primary
education, whichever is the later.</p>

<p>Parents are required to ensure that their children from the age of 6 to the
age of 16 attend a recognised school or receive a certain minimum education.
There is no absolute legal obligation on children to attend school nor on their
parents to send them to school.</p>

<p>Article 42 of Bunreacht na hÉireann (the Constitution) acknowledges that
the primary and natural educator of the child is the family and guarantees to
respect the right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for
the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their
children. Parents are free to provide this education in their homes or in
schools recognised or established by the State. </p>

<h3>The Child and Family Agency</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.tusla.ie/services/educational-welfare-services/">Child and
Family Agency's (CFA)</a> is the national agency responsible to ensure that
every child attends school regularly, or otherwise receives an appropriate
minimum education. It also advises the Government on school attendance and
education provision. The Agency's emphasis is on helping schools, families and
children, rather than imposing penalties for non-attendance at school. It
employs educational welfare officers at local level throughout the country to
provide support and advice to parents and schools and to follow up on absences
from school. They also help to co-ordinate all policies concerning attendance
and educational welfare. The Agency's remit includes responsibility for the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/Home-School-Community-Liaison-HSCL-Scheme/">Home
School Community Liaison Scheme</a>, the <a href="http://www.newb.ie/publications/scpdocumentation.asp">School Completion
Programme</a> and the Educational Welfare Sevice (EWS). </p>

<p>The Agency also:</p>
<ul><li>Monitors school attendance, and takes a range of measures where children
    do not attend school </li>
  <li>Maintains a register of children who are not attending a recognised
    school </li>
  <li>Maintains a register of young persons of 16 and 17 years of age who leave
    school early to take up employment and makes arrangements for their
    continuing education and training in consultation with providers and
    employers </li>
  <li>Collects data on school attendance and non-attendance, suspensions and
    expulsions </li>
  <li>Intervenes in relation to proposed school expulsions </li>
</ul><p>It publishes <a href="http://www.newb.ie/publications/researchreports.asp">reports on school
attendance at primary and post primary schools</a>. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Responsibilities of schools </h3>

<p>Schools are obliged to keep a register of the students attending the school.
They must also maintain attendance records for all students and inform the
<acronym title="National Educational Welfare Board ">Child and Family Agency's
educational welfare services</acronym> if a child is absent for more than 20
days in a school year. </p>

<p>The principal must also inform the <acronym title="National Educational Welfare Board ">Child and Family Agency's
educational welfare services</acronym> if, in his/her view, a student has an
attendance problem. This could arise if the student is not coming to school or
if the student is suspended. You can fin more information about <a shape="rect" href="school_discipline.html">school discipline</a>. Schools can make <a href="https://www.schoolreturn.ie/">returns to the the Agency online</a>.</p>

<p><span><strong>School Attendance Strategy</strong></span></p>

<p>The Board of Management in each school is obliged to prepare a school
attendance strategy and submit it to the <acronym title="National Educational Welfare Board">Agency</acronym>. </p>

<p>This strategy will encourage, in a positive way, regular school attendance
and an appreciation of learning within the school and will provide for:</p>
<ul><li>The rewarding of students who have good attendance records </li>
  <li>The identification of students who are at risk of dropping out at an
    early stage </li>
  <li>The establishment of closer contacts between the school and the families
    concerned </li>
  <li>The co-ordination with other schools of programmes aimed at promoting
    good behaviour and encouraging attendance </li>
  <li>The identification of aspects of the operation and management of the
    school and of the curriculum that may contribute to truancy and the removal
    of those aspects in so far as they are not necessary for the proper running
    of the school. </li>
</ul><p><span><strong>Enforcement</strong></span></p>

<p>With the consent of the parents, the <acronym title="National Educational Welfare Board">Child and Family Agency</acronym>
may arrange for an examination of the intellectual, emotional or physical
development of a child. If the parent refuses consent, the <acronym title="National Educational Welfare Board">Agency</acronym> may apply to the
Circuit Court for an order that the examination be carried out. The Circuit
Court may grant the order if it is satisfied that the child's behaviour, lack
of educational progress or regular absence from school without a reasonable
excuse warrants an examination. </p>

<h3>Responsibilities and duties of parents</h3>

<p>Under the Education Welfare Act 2000 parents must inform the school if their
children will be absent from school on a school day and the reason for the
absence, for example, illness. It is best to do this in writing. The Child and
Family Agency strongly advises against taking children out of school to go on
holiday during term-time.</p>

<p>Parents and guardians have a legal obligation to ensure that their child
attends a school or otherwise receives an education. If the Agency considers
that a parent is failing in his or her obligation, it must send the parent a
School Attendance Notice warning that legal action would follow if the child
did not attend school regularly. Before doing this, it must make reasonable
efforts to consult with the parents and the child. If the parent fails to
comply, he or she may be prosecuted. If convicted, the parent may be fined
€634.87 and/or imprisoned for a month and fined €253.95 for each subsequent
day that he or she fails to send the child to school. If the parent claims that
suitable alternative education is being provided, he or she must prove this. It
will be a defence for the parents to show that they have made all reasonable
efforts to send the child to school - in such cases, the Child and Family
Agency must be informed.</p>

<p>The leaflet for parents <a shape="rect" href="http://www.newb.ie/publications/parentdocumentation.asp"><em>Don't let
your</em> <em>child</em> <em>miss out</em> is available in 18 languages.</a>
</p>

<h3>Education outside the school system</h3>

<p>The Minister may prescribe minimum standards of education for <a shape="rect" href="../../the_irish_education_system/home_education.html">those
educated outside the recognised school system</a>.</p>

<p>The <acronym title="National Educational Welfare Board">Child and Family
Agency</acronym> is obliged to maintain a register of children who are
receiving education but not attending a recognised school. In effect, this
register will show the names of children who are being educated at home or in a
non-recognised school - it is not a register of school dropouts.</p>

<p>Parents whose children are not attending a recognised school must register
their child with the Agency. If the parent agrees, the Agency will then
investigate the educational arrangements that have been made for the child and
judge whether or not the child is receiving the prescribed minimum education.
If the Agency is satisfied, it may enter the child's name on the register.</p>

<p>If the Child and Family Agency is not satisfied, it may either:</p>
<ul><li>Require the parents to comply with its requirements in order to ensure
    that the child receives the prescribed minimum education and then register
    the child, or </li>
  <li>Refuse to register the child. </li>
</ul><p>There are also provisions for removing a child's name from the register</p>

<h3>Obligation to attend school</h3>

<p>Parents do not have to send their children to a recognised school if:</p>
<ul><li>The child is on the register described above </li>
  <li>Parents have made an application have their child included on the
    register but a decision has not been made or an appeal is pending </li>
  <li>The child is being educated outside the state </li>
  <li>There is a good reason for the child not attending school </li>
</ul><p>If the Child and Family Agency refuses to register a child, or requires an
undertaking from a parent or removes a child from the register, the parent may
appeal to the Minister. The Minister will appoint an appeal committee, which
may decide to register the child, refuse to register the child or require an
undertaking. </p>

<p>Where no appeal is brought, the Agency must make every reasonable effort to
have the child in question enrolled in another school. If this fails, the
Agency must ensure that the child receives a prescribed minimum education</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/The-Department/Management-Organisation/ICT-Information-and-Communications-Technology-Policy-Unit.html">Department
of Education and Skills (DES)</a> is responsible for developing Information and
Communications Technology (ICT) in schools. It aims to help teachers to
incorporate ICT into their skill sets and teaching practice, and to develop
curriculum and learning resources that make use of ICT.</p>

<p>This document outlines the strategies and programmes in place to achieve
these aims. Most of these programmes are operated and managed by the
Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST). </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l52d08">ICT in Schools Programme</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/Information-Communications-Technology-ICT-in-Schools/">ICT
in Schools Programme</a> began in 1998. NCTE was set up by the Department of
Education and Skills to manage the <a href="http://www.tcd.ie/Education/ICT/unit03/introduction02.htm">Schools IT2000
initiative</a> and to provide support to first and second level schools
integrating ICT into learning and teaching.</p>

<p>In 2008, the Department published 2 reports on ICT in schools. <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Press-Events/Press-Releases/2008-Press-Releases/PR10-07-08.html">Investing
Effectively in Information and Communications Technology in Schools
2008-2013</a> is the report of the strategy group appointed to advise on
priorities for investment in ICT in schools. <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Press-Events/Press-Releases/2008-Press-Releases/PR10-07-08.html">ICT
in Schools</a> is an evaluation on the impact of ICT on teaching and learning
which was done by the Departmentâ€™s Inspectorate.</p>

<p>In 2009, the <a href="http://www.into.ie/ROI/Publications/OtherPublications/OtherPublicationsDownloads/SmartSchools=SmartEconomy.pdf">Smart
Schools = Smart Economy (pdf)</a> report was published by the Joint Advisory
Group. This Group was appointed by the then Minister to work with industry to
explore possible approaches to implementing the recommendations of the 2008
Strategy Group Report.</p>

<p>Equipment grants have also been provided to schools under this programme.</p>

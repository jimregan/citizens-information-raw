<p>The Inclusion Support Service (which is part of the National Council of
Special Education) operates <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/Visiting-Teacher-Service-/">Visiting
Teacher Service</a> for deaf or hard-of-hearing children and children with
visual impairments. Specially trained teachers provide the service. Visiting
teachers aim to be a support to both the parents or guardian and the child. The
support service can begin shortly following the birth of the child and continue
through primary and post-primary education where appropriate. In addition, the
teachers provide a teaching service for the <a shape="rect" href="../../pre_school_education_and_childcare/early_childhood_education.html">pre-school
child</a> in the home if considered necessary. </p>

<p>Each teacher has responsibility for a particular region and travels to meet
the children, parents or guardians, teachers, care staff and other
professionals involved with the child as necessary. No child is too young to be
referred to the visiting teacher service. The Visiting Teacher Service is free
of charge. </p>

<h3>Visiting teachers for visually impaired children</h3>

<p>Visiting teachers assess and evaluate the needs of each child and explain
the effects of visual impairment, including the current and future implications
of the impairment. </p>

<p>In addition, they provide information and advice to assess educational
planning for children and young people with visual impairments. Visiting
teachers co-operate closely with colleagues from a range of educational and
other professional backgrounds, in addition to national organisations.</p>

<p>Visiting teachers advise schools (including pre-schools) regarding suitable
teaching methods and classroom management strategies to support pupils with
visual impairments in mainstream schools. </p>

<p>They conduct assessments and give advice in relation to equipment commonly
used by people who are visually impaired and advice on additional personnel
resources, when needed. Teachers can also advise schools on any necessary
adaptations to the school environment required by the child with visual
impairment. </p>

<h3>Visiting teachers for deaf children</h3>

<p>Visiting teachers work with pre-school children to provide guidance and
support for parents of deaf or hard-of-hearing children. They inform parents of
the implications of deafness for the acquisition of spoken language and Irish
Sign Language (ISL), inform parents of communication methods and liaise with
audiology services. Applications for home tuition in sign language should be
made to the visiting teacher.</p>

<p>Visiting teachers also monitor the childâ€™s language development and
communication skills and give information and advice to parents on pre-school
and school placements. At primary level the visiting teacher works with the
principal and other staff to plan and put in place suitable supports for the
child. They can provide tuition with special emphasis on language development
and monitor the educational progress of the child. </p>

<h3>Training in assistive technologies and mobility</h3>

<p>Visiting teachers can refer children for assessment of low-vision aids and
then train the children in their use. They help children develop tactile and
other sensory skills and give advice on self-help skills and other skills
needed for independent living. </p>

<p>They provide support in the development of pre-Braille skills where
necessary and give some instruction in mobility where appropriate. Teachers can
also refer the child for further mobility instruction where required. You can
read more about <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/transport_and_disability/mobility_training_for_people_with_a_visual_impairment.html">mobility
training for visually impaired people here</a>. </p>

<p>Visiting teachers evaluate the acoustic environment for a deaf or
hard-of-hearing child and help them manage audiology equipment. </p>

<p>If you have finished your secondary education and would like to develop
vocational and technological skills in order to get a job or to go into further
education and training, the Post-Leaving Certificate (PLC) course may be the
one you are looking for. The PLC is often seen just as a course for
school-leavers. In fact, you will be also welcomed as an adult participant.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0013_2011.pdf">A
participant contribution of €200 per year (pdf)</a> is charged for PLC
students. There are some exemptions to this contribution - see 'Rates'
below.</p>

<p>PLC courses take place in schools, colleges and community education centres.
The courses are full-time and last for one to two years. They offer a mixture
of practical work, academic work and work experience. They are designed as a
step towards skilled employment and, as such, they are closely linked to
industry and its needs. Post Leaving Certificate courses adopt an integrated
approach, focusing on technical knowledge, core skills and work experience.
Almost half of the time spent on these courses is devoted to knowledge and
skill training related to employment, with a further quarter spent on relevant
work-based experience. </p>

<p>Most PLC courses are delivered by <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Employment-Services-Offices.aspx">Education
and Training Boards (ETBs)</a>. A wide range of disciplines are covered
including business, electronics engineering, computing, catering, sport and
leisure, theatre and stage, performance art, art craft and design, equestrian
studies, multi-media studies, journalism, tourism, marketing, childcare and
community care, hairdressing and beauty care, applied science, horticulture
etc. See 'How to apply' below for a link to Qualifax, the national learners'
database, where you can search for PLC courses.</p>

<p>The qualification you receive at the end of your training will depend on the
type of course you have chosen. Many of the 1-year PLC courses offer <a href="http://www.qqi.ie/">Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI)</a>
accreditation at level 5 on the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nfq.ie/nfq/en/learner.html">National Framework of
Qualifications</a>, while other more advanced courses may offer QQI level 6,
which can lead to further studies at third level. Other qualifications such as
City and Guilds are also available. It is important to check out the
qualification attached to a particular course before you decide to enrol. </p>

<p><strong>Changes to Vocational Educational Committees (VECs)</strong></p>

<p>Since 1 July 2013, Education and Training Boards (ETBs) replaced Vocational
Educational Committees (VECs). All services provided by VECs will continue to
be provided by ETBs. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>In general, you should have finished your secondary education and taken your
Leaving Certificate examination in order to be eligible for a PLC course.
However, if you have work experience relevant to the course on offer or think
you can demonstrate a particular ability in that area, you should write to the
college where the course will take place. Explain your circumstances in the
letter and ask to meet the co-ordinator of the course.</p>

<p>You may be eligible for a means-tested student grant or a <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">Back
to Education Allowance</a>, depending on your circumstances. Our document on <a shape="rect" href="../../third_level_education/fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/maintenance_grant_schemes_for_students_on_third_level_courses.html">Grants
for students in further and higher education</a> describes who qualifies for a
grant and how to apply. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Up to the academic year 2011/2012, Irish nationals and nationals of other EU
member states did not have to pay tuition fees for approved PLC courses. Some
other categories of students were also entitled to access them free of fees -
see <a shape="rect" href="http://www.studentfinance.ie/mp9378/my-chosen-full-time-course-is-in-a-further-education-college-in-ireland/index.html">studentfinance.ie</a>
for details.</p>

<p>A participant contribution of €200 per year was introduced in the academic
year 2011/2012.</p>

<p>You do not have to pay the contribution if:</p>
<ul><li>You hold a full <a href="../../../health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical
    card</a> in your own right</li>
  <li>You are the dependent child of a full medical card holder</li>
  <li>You are eligible for a <a href="../../third_level_education/fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/maintenance_grant_schemes_for_students_on_third_level_courses.html">student
    grant</a> </li>
  <li>You are getting <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">Back
    to Education Allowance</a> or a <a href="../../returning_to_education/vocational_training_opportunities_scheme.html">VTOS</a>
    allowance</li>
</ul><p>Colleges offering PLC courses usually also have a 'course charge' to cover
such expenses as books, uniforms, student services, professional registration
fees and exam fees. The amount varies from college to college. Students who are
exempted from the participant contribution will still have to pay the course
charge.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>Use the national learners' database <a shape="rect" href="http://www.qualifax.ie/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;view=wrapper&amp;Itemid=15">qualifax.ie</a>
to find the course in which you are most interested. Apply directly to the
school or college offering that course. Because the courses are work-related,
you will probably be called for an interview before a final selection is made.
These interviews are often quite informal and offer you the opportunity to
discuss your particular interest in the course.</p>

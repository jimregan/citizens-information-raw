<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>There are different schemes which provide funding to help with the costs of
going to school. Most of the schemes are for students with family incomes below
a certain level who are dependent on a social welfare payment. There is also a
scheme for second-level students who are disadvantaged by living a long way
from school. The details of the various schemes are set out below.</p>

<h3>Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/back_to_school_clothing_and_footwear_allowance.html">Back
to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance</a> is designed to help meet the cost
of uniforms and footwear for students attending school. To be eligible for the
Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance, the applicant (parent or
guardian) must be getting certain social welfare benefits or payments for
training, employment schemes or adult education and total household income must
be below a certain amount. </p>

<h3>School Books Grant Scheme</h3>

<p>The School Books Grant Scheme is available to State primary and post-primary
schools to help with the cost of school books. Funding for this scheme comes
from the Department of Education and Skills and the scheme is administered in
each school by the school principal.</p>

<p>The scheme is mainly aimed at pupils from low-income families and families
experiencing financial hardship. It can be used to set up a book rental scheme
within the school or help individual students buy books. The Department of
Education prefers schools to use it to set up book rental schemes as this helps
more students from low income families. The Department has issued schools with
<a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/Textbook-Rental-Schemes-in-Schools/Guidelines-for-Developing-Textbook-Rental-Schemes-in-Schools.pdf">Guidelines
for Developing Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools</a>.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, students who may be eligible for assistance under the
School Books Grant Scheme include:</p>
<ul><li>Families that are mainly dependent on social welfare payments </li>
  <li>Families on low incomes, (for example, those receiving <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
    Income Supplement</a>, and the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/back_to_school_clothing_and_footwear_allowance.html">Back
    to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance</a>) </li>
  <li>Families experiencing financial hardship because of particular
    circumstances (for example, where there is prolonged illness of a
    parent/guardian, addiction problems, etc.) </li>
</ul><p>Students who are in the care of foster families under arrangements made by a
Local Health Office and students participating in Youthreach, VTOS and
Post-Leaving Certificate Courses do not qualify for assistance under the School
Books Grant Scheme. </p>

<p>You can find out more about the scheme in the Department's publication <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/Textbook-Rental-Schemes-in-Schools/A-Guide-for-Parents-Textbook-Rental-Schemes-in-Schools.pdf">A
Guide for Parents: Text Book Rental Scheme in Schools</a>. </p>

<h3>Exemption from examination fees</h3>

<p>Students whose parent or guardian holds a current <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical
card</a> do not have to pay the examination fees for Junior or Leaving
Certificate. In this case, details of the medical card are put on the fee
payment form and the parent then sends the form back to the school. If you are
exempt from fees because your parents hold a medical card you are still liable
for late fees if you apply after the deadline. More detailed information is
available on <a shape="rect" href="../../state_examinations/examination_fees.html">Leaving Certificate
examination fees</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../../state_examinations/junior_certificate_programme.html">Junior
Certificate examination fees</a>.</p>

<h3>Remote Areas Boarding Grant </h3>

<p>Under the Remote Area Grant scheme funding is available to support pupils
who live far from a school providing suitable free second-level education. To
qualify for a boarding grant the pupil must live at least 4.8 km from a
second-level school and more than 3.2 km from a pick-up point on a transport
service to such a school. The pupil must be unable to obtain a place in a
suitable second-level school within 25 km of their home and must be attending a
second-level school providing free second-level education for day pupils.
Pupils living on offshore islands which do not have a school providing suitable
free second-level education may also qualify for assistance under the scheme.

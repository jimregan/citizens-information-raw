<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>The Department of Education and Skills gives a grant to schools to allow
them to purchase equipment for use by students with a disability in
second-level schools. </p>

<p>The scheme applies to a student with a physical disability or a student who
has a communications disability that makes ordinary communication through
speech and writing impossible. </p>

<p>The purpose of the scheme is to provide the student with equipment that will
be of direct educational benefit to him/her. An example of such equipment would
be a computer, tape recorder, word processor, drafting machine, induction loop,
braille equipment and software. </p>

<p>The equipment is kept in the school. However, the Board of Management may
give permission for a student to use the equipment at home. The equipment
remains the property of the school and will usually be passed on to another
student or to another school, when the school no longer needs it. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The Department of Education and Skills must be satisfied that the student is
capable of benefiting from the equipment in question. Generally the school must
show that the student needs the equipment during the school day and that the
existing equipment in the school cannot meet the student's needs without
depriving other students of access to the equipment. </p>

<p>Schools must wait for approval before buying equipment. When the equipment
has been bought, receipted invoices should be sent with claims for payment.
Copies of these should be kept in the school account. </p>

<p>The Board of Management of the school is responsible for insurance,
maintenance, repair and service charges. One teacher should be given the
responsibility for managing the equipment and making sure that it is used
effectively in the school. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The rate of the grant considered for any student will be the cost of the
equipment. There is no upper limit.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>The school management should submit applications for special equipment to
the Special Needs Education Organiser (SENO) with responsibility for that
school. (You will find <a shape="rect" href="http://ncse.ie/seno-contact-list">a contact list of SENOs</a> and <a shape="rect" href="http://ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/NCSE-Application-Form-3-Application-for-Assistive-Technology.final_.23.02.15.doc">an
application form</a> on the website of the National Council for Special
Education. A recent comprehensive and professional assessment of the nature and
extent of the student's disability and the equipment most appropriate to
his/her needs should accompany the application. This may include a
psychological assessment, an occupational therapy report, a physiotherapy
report or another professional report.</p>

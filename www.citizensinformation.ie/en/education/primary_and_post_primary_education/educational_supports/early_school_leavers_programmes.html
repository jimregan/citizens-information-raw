<p>The legal definition of early school leaving refers to non-participation in
school before reaching the age of 16 years or before completing 3 years
post-primary education, whichever is later. A more specific definition of early
school leavers is those who leave the education system without a minimum of 5
passes in the Leaving Certificate or equivalent qualification. Young people who
leave education without recognised qualifications are at a disadvantage in the
labour market and are at increased risk of poverty and social exclusion.</p>

<p><br>
For those people who have already left school and would like to further their
education and training, there are a number of schemes in place. These are
non-formal education facilities that aim to provide high quality, relevant and
efficient education and training opportunities outside the mainstream education
setting.</p>

<h3>School completion programme</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.tusla.ie/services/educational-welfare-services/school-support-services-under-the-deis-initiative/school-completion-programme">School
Completion Programme</a> aims to increase the number of young people staying in
primary and second-level schools. The programme is a support strand within the
Child and Family Agency under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. It
forms part of the Department of Education and Skills social inclusion strategy
<a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-/">Delivering
Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS)</a> to help children and young people
who are at risk of or who are experiencing <a href="../../primary_and_post_primary_education/attendance_and_discipline_in_schools/school_attendance.html">educational
disadvantage</a>. Each project is managed by a local management committee and
provides a tailored programme of in-school, after school and holiday time
interventions to targeted children and young people who are at risk of early
school leaving.</p>

<h3>Back to Education Initiative</h3>

<p>The Back to Education Initiative provides opportunities for second chance
education to adult learners and early school leavers who want to upgrade their
skills. The initiative builds on existing schemes such as Youthreach and
Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) - see below. It also includes

schemes</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../../adult_and_life_long_education/community_education.html">community
education</a> and <a shape="rect" href="post_leaving_certificate_courses.html">Post Leaving Certificate (PLC)</a>
courses. </p>

<h3>Youthreach programme</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="youthreach.html">Youthreach</a> is a joint programme
between the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Jobs,
Enterprise and Innovation. It is intended to help young people return to
learning and prepare for employment and adult life. It also provides them with
opportunities to get certified qualifications. The programme is aimed at
unemployed early school leavers aged 15 to 20. The Youthreach programme is
delivered through Youthreach centres and <a href="http://www.iacto.ie/learners/ctcs/">Community Training Centres</a>. </p>

<h3>Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme <br></h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../../returning_to_education/vocational_training_opportunities_scheme.html">Vocational
Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS)</a> is a special range of courses designed
to meet the education needs of unemployed people. The scheme aims to give them
a choice of options from basic education and training to advanced vocational
preparation and training. It targets people over the age of 21 who have been
getting unemployment payments or <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">signing
for credits</a> for at least 6 months. It is delivered through the Education
and Training Boards (ETBs) at centres all over Ireland - see 'Where to apply'
below.</p>

<h3>Department of Justice workshop programme<br></h3>

<p>The Department of Justice runs employment placement, education and training
services for offenders where they can train to develop work-related skills.
Many of the available training opportunities carry accreditation or
certification for people who complete the required course to the approved
standard. </p>

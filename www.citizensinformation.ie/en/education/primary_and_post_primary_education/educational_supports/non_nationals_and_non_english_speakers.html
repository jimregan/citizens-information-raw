<p>Full details of the resources available for EAL support are set out in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0007_2016.pdf"><u>DES

Here is a link to <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/Teacher-Allocations/Teacher-Allocation/Frequently-Asked-Questions-on-Circular-0007-2016.pdf">frequently
asked questions on Circular 0007/2016 (pdf)</a>. 

<p>Under the teacher allocation reforms introduced in 2012, the combined
resources available for GAM (General Allocation Model of Learning Support) and
EAL were used to create a single allocation process for all primary schools to
cover both the GAM and language support. Autonomy is given to schools to deploy
GAM/EAL hours between learning and language support depending on the specific
needs of the school.</p>

<p>Where at least 20% of the total enrolment of the school is made up of pupils
that require EAL support, the Board of Management can lodge an appeal for a
review of the proposed allocation for pupils requiring EAL support.<br></p>

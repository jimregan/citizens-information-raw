<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Erasmus+ (called Erasmus plus) is the new EU funding programme for
education, training, youth and sport. The programme runs from 2014 to 2020. It
combines previous funding programmes in the sector including the Lifelong
Learning Programme (Comenius, Leonardo, Erasmus, Grundtvig and Transversal
Programmes), Youth in Action, Jean Monnet, Tempus and Erasmus Mundus.</p>

<p>The previous programmes have now closed and no further applications under
those programmes can be accepted. Existing projects funded by those programmes
will wind down over the next 1 - 3 years. </p>

<p>Erasmus+ will provide opportunities for <a href="http://www.leargas.ie/programmes/erasmusplus/">participants</a> who
include students and education staff, to study, train, get work experience and
volunteer abroad. In addition to providing grants for individuals, Erasmus+
will support transnational partnerships among education, training and youth
institutions and organisations. It will also support national efforts to
modernise education, training and youth systems. For the first time it will
provide support to sport initiatives.</p>

<p>The main aims of Erasmus+ are to:</p>
<ul><li>Help young people to acquire additional skills through studying and
    training abroad</li>
  <li>Enhance teaching quality in the EU and beyond</li>
  <li>Support member states and partner countries in modernising their
    education and vocational training systems</li>
  <li>Promote youth participation in society</li>
  <li>Support teaching and research on European integration</li>
  <li>Support European grass-roots sport</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l82f0c">Projects funded</h2>

<p>Erasmus+ will provide support to initiatives that meet the criteria of any
one of the following five actions:</p>
<ul><li>Key Action 1: Learning mobility of individuals</li>
  <li>Key Action 2: Co-operation for innovation and the exchange of good
    practices</li>
  <li>Key Action 3: Support for policy reform</li>
  <li>Jean Monnet activities</li>
  <li>Sport</li>
</ul><h3>Key Action 1: Learning mobility of individuals</h3>

<p>Projects funded under this key action enable participants to travel to
another participating country in order to study, work, teach, train or develop
professional skills and competences. Under Erasmus+ mobility activities are
project-based and will need to be led by organisations. Individuals are no
longer able to apply.</p>

<p>Activities funded under this key action include, youth exchanges, European
Voluntary Service, a period of study or work placement for students in higher
education or vocational education and training. </p>

<p>Youth exchanges allow groups of young people from different countries to
meet and live together for up to 21 days. During a youth exchange, participants
jointly carry out a work programme designed and prepared by them before the
exchange.</p>

<p>The European Voluntary Service allows young people aged 17 - 30 to express
their personal commitment through unpaid and full-time voluntary service for up
to 12 months in another country within or outside the European Union.</p>

<h3>Key Action 2: Co-operation for innovation and the exchange of good
practices.</h3>

<p>Initiatives supported under this key action enable organisations to work
together in order to improve their provision for learners and share innovative
practices.</p>

<p>Under this action, one organisation will lead the project and manage the
activities and funding on behalf of the partnership. Different sizes of
partnership are possible so that smaller organisations can get involved.</p>

<h3>Key Action 3: Support for policy reform</h3>

<p>This key action supports initiatives which enable the active participation
of young people in democratic life and fosters debate around topics centred on
the themes and priorities set by the Structured Dialogue. Structured Dialogue
is the name used for discussions between young people and youth policy makers
to get results which are useful for policy-making.</p>

<p>More information about <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/youth/policy/implementation/dialogue_en.htm">Structured
Dialogue is available on the European Commission's website</a>.</p>

<h3>Jean Monnet activities</h3>

<p>Jean Monnet activities support worldwide excellence in European integration
studies. This is a centralised action run by the European Commission’s
Executive Agency.</p>

<p>They provide support and funding to academic institutions and other
associations active in the field of European integration studies to promote
excellence in European integration studies in higher education.</p>

<h3>Sport</h3>

<p>Funding for certain sporting activities is available under the sport action.
This is a centralised action run by the European Commission’s Executive
Agency.</p>

<p>Support will be provided to organisations active in the field of sport to
tackle cross-border threats to the integrity of sport (doping, match-fixing,
violence, intolerance, discrimination), promote good governance in grassroots
sport, support dual careers for athletes and provide equal access to sport for
all. </p>

<p>Europass is an EU initiative to help people make their skills, and
qualifications clearly understood throughout Europe. Europass brings together
documents that have been developed at European level to facilitate the movement
of both learners and workers throughout Europe. These documents are Europass
CV, Europass Language Passport, Europass Mobility Document, Europass
Certificate Supplement and Europass Diploma Supplement (described in detail in
‘Rules’ below). </p>

<p>The 5 documents are collectively referred to as the Europass Portfolio. </p>

<p>People can use Europass documents when they are seeking jobs and when they
wish to enter education and training programmes. The documents are especially
helpful when people move between countries to work because they make it easier
for employers to understand the qualifications and competences of job seekers
from other EU Member States. Europass also helps education, training and
guidance practitioners to advise people about the most suitable learning paths
and opportunities. </p>

<p><span>Europass CV</span> is a standard CV format you can use to detail your
qualifications and skills in a straightforward and understandable manner. The
Europass CV can be completed online at the <a shape="rect" href="http://europass.cedefop.europa.eu/en/home">Europass portal</a>. </p>

<p><span>Europass Language Passport</span> allows you to describe and detail
your language skills and competences. It is a self-assessment document and
allows the user to detail their ability to understand, speak and write a
language. The Europass Language Passport can be completed online at the <a shape="rect" href="http://europass.cedefop.europa.eu/en/home">Europass
portal</a>. </p>

<p><span>Europass Mobility</span> is a personal document, which is used to
record an organised period of time (a mobility experience) that a person spends
in another European country for the purpose of learning or training. This might
include a work placement in a company or an academic term as part of an
exchange programme.</p>

<p>The mobility experience is monitored by two partner organisations, the first
in the country of origin and the second in the host country. Both partners
agree on the purpose, content and duration of the experience and a mentor is
identified in the host country. The partners can be universities, schools,
training centres, companies and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). You
obtain the Europass Mobility by contacting the organisation sending you abroad
and asking them to contact the National Europass Centre.</p>

<p><span>Europass Certificate Supplement</span> provides extra information
about vocational education and training awards. It supplements the original
certificate, making it more easily understood, especially by employers or
institutions outside the issuing country. </p>

<p><span>Europass Diploma Supplement</span> is issued to graduates of higher
educations institutions along with their degree or diploma. It helps to ensure
that higher education qualifications are more easily understood, especially
outside the country where they were awarded. </p>

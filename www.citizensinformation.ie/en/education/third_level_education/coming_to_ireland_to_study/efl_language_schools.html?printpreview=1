<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>Ireland is a popular destination for those interested in learning English.
There are many schools and courses available throughout the country that cater
for everyone from business executives and students who want to improve their
English language proficiency, to those who want to learn how to teach English
as a foreign language. </p>

<p>The majority of English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) schools in Ireland are
privately run and provide students with a full package of tuition, homestay
accommodation and extra-curricular activities. The majority of schools offer
preparation programmes for the major English language examinations, such as
TOEFL, IELTS, Cambridge and Trinity College (London). TEFL (Teaching English as
a Foreign Language) programmes are also available at many private schools and a
number of universities (<a shape="rect" href="http://www.ucd.ie">University
College Dublin</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ucc.ie">University College
Cork</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ucg.ie">NUI Galway</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dculs.dcu.ie/">Dublin City University</a> agus <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ul.ie">University of Limerick</a>. </p>

<h3>Accreditation and Co-ordination of English Language Services</h3>

<p>It is important to ensure that high standards exist throughout the <acronym title=" English as a foreign language">EFL</acronym> sector and that courses in
<acronym title=" English as a foreign language">EFL</acronym> schools in
Ireland are comparable with other international courses. The Department of
Education and Skills has given Accreditation and Co-ordination of English
Language Services (ACELS) the responsibility for monitoring the <acronym title=" English as a foreign language">EFL</acronym> sector. Since January 2011
ACELS is part of <a href="http://www.qqi.ie/">Quality and Qualifications
Ireland (QQI)</a>.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.acels.ie/search.htm">list of recognised
EFL schools and organisations in Ireland</a> is published on an annual basis
and is available on the <acronym title="Advisory Council for English Language Schools ">ACELS</acronym> web
site. </p>

<h3>Regulations governing EFL schools</h3>

<p>New schools receive two inspection visits, 10 months apart. If <acronym title="Advisory Council for English Language Schools ">ACELS</acronym> is
satisfied after the second inspection, the school be officially recognised.
<acronym title="Advisory Council for English Language Schools ">ACELS</acronym>
will inspect existing schools at least once every three years to make sure that
they are adhering to the regulations. While this is normal practice, <acronym title="Advisory Council for English Language Schools ">it </acronym>has the
authority to visit or inspect a school at all reasonable times. </p>

<p><acronym title="Advisory Council for English Language Schools ">ACELS</acronym> has a
number of criteria that it uses to determine if a school is worthy of official
recognition, which includes the following:</p>
<ul><li>All premises used by the school must comply with the Schedule of Required
    Standards prepared by <acronym title="Advisory Council for English Language Schools ">ACELS</acronym>.
    These standards include local authority requirements in planning,
    construction, water supply, sewage disposal, fire precautions and general
    safety. Schools must also be properly heated and ventilated and provide
    adequate facilities (learning and recreational) for students. </li>
  <li>Schools must have the correct public and employer liability insurance
    cover and all <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/employment_rights_and_duties/employment_law_update.html">employment
    legislation</a> and <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/health_and_safety/health_safety_work.html">health
    and safety legislation</a> must be complied with. Safety statements and
    logs must be available for inspection. </li>
  <li>Schools must adhere to all the <a href="../../../moving_country/moving_to_ireland/studying_in_ireland/immigration_nonEEA_students.html">immigration
    requirements for students</a> laid down by the Department of Justice and
    Equality. </li>
  <li>The courses provided by schools must be educationally sound and have
    content appropriate to their stated objectives. </li>
  <li>Course programmes should clearly state the number of tuition hours. The
    number of hours should normally not be less than 15 per week. </li>
  <li>Students should be placed in class according to competence and age and
    there should normally be no more than 15 students per class. </li>
  <li>A complete schedule of supervised activities must form an essential part
    of all junior programmes. </li>
  <li>If it is appropriate, the school's courses should reflect Irish life and
    culture. </li>
  <li>All teachers working in language schools must have a Level 7 degree and
    taken a recognised EFL certificate course. </li>
  <li>The school must make sure that arrangements are in place for teacher
    induction and that ongoing teacher development is provided. </li>
  <li>Each school must have a person with appropriate skills, experience and
    qualifications in the field of academic management to deal with the needs
    of the curriculum. This person must be available to students and staff
    during a normal working day. </li>
  <li>All information contained in advertising and promotional material
    (brochures, etc.) must be clear, accurate and verifiable. </li>
  <li>In circumstances where students are referred to other organisations for
    tuition, the organisations must be recognised by ACELS as an English
    Language Teaching Organisation. ACELS may at any time withdraw recognition
    from an organisation. Refusal/withdrawal of recognition from one centre
    may, at the discretion of ACELS, lead to the refusal/withdrawal of
    recognition from an organisation as a whole. </li>
  <li>Only centres that have been inspected by ACELS at specified addresses and
    for which recognition has been obtained can be advertised in publicity
    material claiming recognition by ACELS. </li>
</ul><h3>Requirements for host family accommodation</h3>

<p>If accommodation is organised by the school, it must meet the required
standards for host family accommodation or residential accommodation. The first
requirement is that the student should be well looked after and treated as a
member of the family during his or her stay. </p>

<p>The following facilities should be made available to the student:</p>
<ul><li>A comfortable bed with good supply of quality bedclothes and weekly
    change of bed linen </li>
  <li>Adequate space for clothes storage </li>
  <li>Laundry or reasonable access to a washing machine </li>
  <li>Table and chair in bedroom for private study or access at all times to
    another room with study facilities </li>
  <li>Free access to a bathroom and bath or shower daily </li>
  <li>Adequate heating, lighting and ventilation. </li>
</ul><p>Each host family can accommodate up to three students, but only one student
of any particular mother tongue. There should only be two students to a room at
any time and a well-balanced and varied diet should be provided. EFL
organisations offering residential programmes are required to have the
accommodation approved by Fáilte Ireland - (the National Tourism Development
Board for the island of Ireland). Further details are available from <acronym title="Advisory Council for English Language Schools">ACELS</acronym> and
schools must carry out regular checks on the accommodation they provide for
students. </p>

<h3>TEFL courses</h3>

<p>The purpose of TEFL courses is to familiarise candidates with current
practices in teaching English as a foreign language. Courses also instruct
candidates how to construct and teach a series of lessons appropriate to the
level and needs of language learners. TEFL courses are run in many private
schools and a number of universities. They range from basic introductory
courses to courses designed to prepare candidates for the workplace. More
in-depth courses aimed at TEFL professionals interested in further professional
development are also available from both private schools and universities. </p>

<h3>Test of Interactive English</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.acels.ie/acelstie.htm">Test of Interactive English
(TIE)</a> - for English language learners. The test is task-based, with the
content chosen by each individual learner, and can therefore be used to assess
learners with different needs, such as those learning English for business,
academic or general purposes. Learners' communicative and interactive skills
are tested in both predictable and spontaneous situations and they must
complete both an oral and written exam. The test is offered in two formats:</p>
<ul><li>The Junior TIE: for English language learners aged 12-18 years. </li>
  <li>The TIE: for English language learners of 18+ (post secondary). </li>
</ul><p>After taking the TIE, each candidate is awarded a certificate, printed with
the ACELS logo.The certificate also contains the sentence stating that TIE is
recognised by ACELS, a service of QQI which is a statuatory body of the
Department of Education and Skills. Certificates are issued within 10 working
days of the test having been taken. Assessment of the TIE is given according to
the Council of Europe's Common Framework Scale of Language Proficiency. </p>

<h3>MEI</h3>

<p>MEI is an industry body, which represents the majority of recognised EFL
schools in Ireland. All members of MEI are recognised and regulated by ACELS.
The functions of MEI can be defined by the following categories, each of which
has a sub-committee made up from members of the association:</p>
<ul><li>Quality and Standards </li>
  <li>Education and Training </li>
  <li>Government Liaison </li>
  <li>Industry Liaison </li>
  <li>Marketing </li>
  <li>Technology. </li>
</ul><h3>Complaints about English language schools</h3>

<p>If you have any complaints about <acronym title="English as a foreign language">EFL</acronym> schools, you should contact
ACELS - see 'Where to apply' below, which is responsible for monitoring the
standards in these schools.</p>

<p>When you are <a shape="rect" href="../../vocational_education_and_training/training_and_apprentiship_programmes/leaving_school_in_ireland.html">leaving
school</a> you may be intending to start work or you may be planning to go to
college. Many young people go onto to third-level or higher education after
they have obtained their <a shape="rect" href="../../state_examinations/established_leaving_certificate.html">Leaving
Certificate.</a> Some people work for a number of years and then go to college
as <a shape="rect" href="../applying_to_college/third_level_courses_for_mature_students.html">mature
students</a>. If you are not an Irish national or you live outside Ireland you
can find information in our document on <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/studying_in_ireland/third_level_education.html">moving
to Ireland for third-level education</a>. </p>

<h3>Thinking of going to college</h3>

<p>If you are interested in doing a third-level course, you need to start
thinking about it before you leave school. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.qualifax.ie/">Qualifax website</a> has a wide range of
information about higher and further education courses, from university degrees
to certificates and diplomas in further education colleges and institutes of
technology. More information can be found in our document on <a shape="rect" href="third_level_qualifications.html">further and higher education
qualifications</a> which are all now included in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nfq.ie/nfq/en/about_NFQ/framework_levels_award_types.html">the
National Framework of Qualifications</a>. </p>

<h3>Applying to college</h3>

<p>You need to check the <a shape="rect" href="../applying_to_college/application_procedures_and_entry_requirements.html">application
procedures for third-level college</a> before you start your last year at
school. If you are thinking of <a shape="rect" href="../studying_abroad/studying_in_the_uk_including_northern_ireland.html">studying
in the UK</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../studying_abroad/studying_outside_ireland.html">abroad</a> you will
need to find out about what is involved and you may wish to visit a college
before you apply. <a shape="rect" href="../applying_to_college/third_level_education_for_students_with_disabilities.html">If
you have a disability</a> or you are a <a href="../applying_to_college/third_level_admissions_scheme_for_students_from_disadvantaged_backgrounds.html">school-leaver
from a socially disadvantaged background</a> there are supports to help you to
access third-level education.</p>

<h3>Paying for college</h3>

<p>You should check whether you have to pay <a shape="rect" href="../fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/fees.html">fees for your
college course.</a> Most students doing undergraduate courses do not have to
pay the fees. If you do have to pay fees you may claim <a shape="rect" href="../fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/tax_relief_for_third_level_fees.html">tax
relief on the fees</a> for most third-level courses. </p>

<p>There are <a shape="rect" href="../fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/maintenance_grant_schemes_for_students_on_third_level_courses.html">means-tested
maintenance grants</a> for students doing third-level courses. The website <a shape="rect" href="http://www.studentfinance.ie/">studentfinance.ie</a> has
information about the full range of grants and supports available.</p>

<h3>Somewhere to live</h3>

<p>Many students live at home while at college but you may live too far away to
travel there every day. Many colleges have residences for some students but you
may have to <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/renting_a_home/">rent
accommodation</a> near the college. You may be <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/renting_a_home/looking_for_a_flat_or_house_to_rent.html">looking
for a house or flat to rent</a> and, if you find one, you should be aware of <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/renting_a_home/tenants_rights_and_obligations.html">your rights
as a tenant</a>.</p>

<h3>Further information<br></h3>

<p>When you are choosing a college course, it is important to find out as much
information about the course and the college you wish to attend. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.studentfinance.ie/mp7595/higher-education-institutions/index.html">There
is a list of the websites of higher education institutions in Ireland on the
studentfinance.ie website.</a></p>

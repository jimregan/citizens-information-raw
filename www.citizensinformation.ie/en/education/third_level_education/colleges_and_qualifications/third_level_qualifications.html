<p>Different bodies are entitled to award or validate qualifications in the
further and higher education sectors. Further education and training is
education and training between post-primary level and higher education. <a shape="rect" href="third_level_education_in_ireland.html">Higher education and
training</a> is provided mainly in universities and colleges of technology or
equivalent bodies.</p>
<ul><li>Universities:<em></em>The State-supported universities all award their
    own degrees and other awards. <em></em></li>
  <li><span>Institutes of technology:</span> The Dublin Institute of Technology
    also makes its own awards. The other institutes of technology grant
    degrees, diplomas and certificates which are validated by Quality and
    Qualifications Ireland. </li>
  <li><span>Other colleges:</span> The other State-supported colleges generally
    grant awards that are validated by Quality and Qualifications Ireland. </li>
  <li><span>Private colleges:</span> The private colleges make awards, some of
    which are validated by foreign universities and some of which are validated
    by Quality and Qualifications Ireland. Some of their awards are not
    validated by any outside body. </li>
</ul><h3>Quality and Qualifications Ireland</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.qqi.ie/">Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI)</a>
was established on 6 November 2012 under the Qualifications and Quality
Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012. It has taken over the functions of
the following 4 bodies:</p>
<ul><li>National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI)</li>
  <li>Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC)</li>
  <li>Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC)</li>
  <li>Irish Universities Quality Board (IUQB) </li>
</ul><p>The NQAI was, among other things, responsible for establishing and
maintaining the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.qqi.ie/Pages/National-Framework-of-Qualifications-%28NFQ%29.aspx">National
Framework of Qualifications</a>, establishing procedures for the councils and
deciding on procedures to be implemented by the education providers in relation
to access, transfer and progression. The <a href="http://www.qqi.ie/Pages/Qualifications-Recognition-Service.aspx">Qualifications
Recognition</a> service at the NQAI included the <a href="http://www.qqi.ie/Pages/Recognition-of-Foreign-Qualifications-.aspx">recognition
of foreign qualifications</a> and the <a href="http://qsearch.qqi.ie/WebPart/Search?searchtype=recognitions">International
Qualifications Database</a>.</p>

<p>The IUQB was responsible for quality assurance in the Irish university
sector. It conducted regular external reviews of quality procedures in Irish
universities.</p>

<h4>FETAC and HETAC</h4>

<p>The two awarding bodies - the Further Education and Training Awards Council
(FETAC) and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC) - were the
certification bodies for all of the education and training in the State other
than that in primary and post-primary education and in the universities and the
Dublin Institute of Technology. HETAC could delegate authority to institutes of
technology to make higher education and training awards. There was a similar
facility within FETAC.</p>

<p>The principal functions of FETAC and HETAC were: </p>
<ul><li>The establishment of policies and criteria for the making of awards </li>
  <li>The validation of programmes in further or higher education and training
  </li>
  <li>The setting of standards of knowledge, skill or competence which must be
    acquired by learners, before an award may be made </li>
</ul><p>Awards and qualifications formerly made by FETAC and HETAC continue to be
recognised, because they are on the National Framework of Qualifications. If
you are enrolled on a programme leading to a FETAC or HETAC award, your award
will now be made by Quality and Qualifications Ireland.</p>

<h3>Transfer and progression</h3>

<p>All providers of education and training need to inform learners of the
transfer and progression routes that are available for them if they undertake a
particular course. </p>

<h3>Validation of individual learning</h3>

<p>Individual learners may also approach QQI directly to seek certification or
recognition for their existing knowledge, skill or competence. It will be a
matter for QQI to decide how this prior learning and prior experience can be
assessed and they may look for help and advice from the providers of education
and training in making this assessment.</p>

<h3>Protection for learners</h3>

<p>There are specific provisions for the protection of learners where a
provider operates programmes of education and training on a commercial and
profit-making basis. Such programmes will not be recognised by QQI unless there
are provisions in place to ensure that the provider can provide an alternative
place in another institution, or has a reserve fund or is adequately
insured.</p>

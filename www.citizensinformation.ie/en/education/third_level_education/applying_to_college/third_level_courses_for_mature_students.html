<p>Third-level education is becoming increasingly accessible to adults on both
a full-time and a part-time basis.</p>

<h3>Mature student places</h3>

<p>Third-level colleges reserve a small number of places specifically for
mature students who want to participate in full-time day programmes. If you are
over 23* you can apply for one of these places. This means that you will
compete for your place on a different basis to those who are just leaving
school. The number of places reserved for mature students are limited, however,
so it is likely that you will still have to compete with your peers. </p>

<p>*Generally,you are considered to be a mature student if you are at least 23
years of age on January 1 of the year you enter your course. If you are
interested in a particular college you should check how it defines a mature
student.</p>

<p>If you opt for a full-time course in this way, you will be expected to
attend classes or lectures every day and you will be assessed in the same way
as the other students on your course. </p>

<h3>Part-time options</h3>

<p>However, if the full-time model does not suit you, there are other options
available, including part-time courses, modular programmes and distance
learning. </p>

<p>If you choose to study on a part-time or modular basis, you can spread your
studies over a number of years. This gives you the opportunity to organise your
time and to study in bursts when it is most convenient for you. It has the
obvious drawback that it will take longer to complete than a full-time course,
but it also has the advantage that it allows you to work at your own pace,
gradually building credits towards your qualification. </p>

<h3>Modular programmes</h3>

<p>A modular programme is made up of separate modules, which are self-contained
units within a course. You can study and complete each module separately at
different stages during that course. Modular programmes can take place in
regular classroom settings or can be part of a distance learning programme.
Modular courses are available at degree level in some universities.</p>

<h3>Distance learning</h3>

<p>The term <em>distance learning</em> covers a wide range of learning
programmes that take place away from the physical presence of the classroom and
the tutor. If you participate in a distance learning programme, it is likely
that you will use a wide range of packaged materials and media throughout your
course. </p>

<p>Some courses organise periodic classes where students come together for a
day, a weekend or a week at a time, in order to study intensively. </p>

<h3>University access programmes</h3>

<p>University access programmes aim to increase the participation of
under-represented groups at third-level. They do this by supporting young
adults and mature students to study at third-level colleges. Students attending
access or foundation courses that are on the Department of Educationâ€™s
approved list of <a href="../../vocational_education_and_training/post_leaving_certificate_courses.html">post-leaving
certificate courses</a> may be eligible for funding under the <a href="../fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/maintenance_grant_schemes_for_students_on_third_level_courses.html">Student
Grant Scheme</a>. However, students attending a foundation or access course in
any other college or university will not be eligible for funding. An access or
foundation course is considered to be a second-level course for the <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">Back
to Education Allowance</a>. You should check your options around access
programmes with the university of your choice or local <a href="http://www.etbi.ie/etbs/directory-of-etbs/">Education and Training
Board</a>.<br></p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Generally, you will need to have completed your Leaving Certificate.
However, if you are applying for a place as a mature student, you will not be
asked to meet the usual entry requirements. Different courses operate different
entry procedures, but, in general, the colleges will take into account your
educational background, work history, community involvement and other
achievements and interests. This system is known as the Accreditation of Prior
Experiential Learning (APEL) or <a href="http://www.qualifax.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=161&amp;Itemid=198">Recognition
of Prior Learning (RPL)</a>. It is useful to find out whether the college of
your choice uses the APEL system before you apply. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.qualifax.ie/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=17&amp;Mainsec=courses&amp;Subsec=search_courses&amp;action=reset&amp;CSH_ID=7&amp;view=wrapper">The
Qualifax website has information about mature student entry requirements for
full-time undergraduate courses</a>.</p>

<p>In some cases, you may be asked to take an entrance exam.</p>

<h3>Full-time study</h3>

<p>You will not have to pay fees in publically funded colleges if you qualify
for the <a href="../fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/fees.html">Free Fees
Initiative</a>. However, you will have to pay the student contribution unless
you also qualify for the <a href="../fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/maintenance_grant_schemes_for_students_on_third_level_courses.html">student
grant</a>. You should also find out if you qualify for the <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">Back
to Education Allowance</a>. </p>

<p>If you are planning to study at a private third-level college, however, you
will be charged fees. These vary from college to college. You can apply for <a shape="rect" href="../fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/tax_relief_for_third_level_fees.html">tax
relief</a> if you are paying for the course from your own income or another
person can claim if they are paying fees on your behalf.</p>

<h3>Part-time, modular and distance education</h3>

<p>You will have to pay fees for all part-time, modular and distance education
courses. The costs vary from course to course. However, you may apply for <a href="../fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/tax_relief_for_third_level_fees.html">tax
relief</a> if you are participating on an approved course. </p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>In order to apply for a third-level course as a mature student, you should
first contact the college of your choice directly and send them an up-to-date
curriculum vitae (CV). Some colleges require you to apply through the <a href="application_procedures_and_entry_requirements.html">Central
Applications Office</a> and you must apply before 1 February of the year you
start your course. You will be in competition with other mature students for a
place on the course so make sure to include as much detail as possible
regarding your educational background, work experience and other interests. If
your CV gets through the first part of the application procedure, you will be
called for interview. At this point, you may be asked to bring along work that
shows your aptitude for the course in question or you may be required to sit an
aptitude test. </p>

<p>If you are unemployed, you may want to continue your education or take part
in a training course to develop your skills and improve your chances of getting
back to work. </p>

<p>Springboard provides free higher education courses for people who are
unemployed. Most Springboard courses are part-time, but there is an increasing
number of full-time courses available to certain participants.</p>

<p>If Springboard doesn’t meet your needs, there are several <a href="../../returning_to_education/sources_of_information_on_returning_to_education.html">other
ways to go back to education</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>If you take up a Springboard course, you can keep your existing social
welfare payment if you continue to fulfil the conditions for the payment.</p>

<p>You do not have to pay any course fees or charges while you are unemployed.
</p>

<p>If you take up a job while on a course, Springboard will also fund the fees
for the full academic year. If your course extends into another academic
year(s) the amount of fees payable will be a matter for your college to
decide.</p>

Springboard course you will continue to get your jobseeker’s payment under
the <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/back_to_education/part_time_education_option.html">Part-Time
Education Option (PTEO)</a>. If you are on a full-time Springboard course you
will transfer to a Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) - you must meet the
qualifying criteria for BTEA.</p>

<p>If you have started a Springboard course and lose your qualifying social
welfare payment you can continue on your course.</p>

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>You apply for almost all full-time undergraduate courses through the Central
Applications Office (CAO). The undergraduate courses in the universities and
institutes of technology include Higher Certificates - Level 6, Ordinary
Bachelor degrees - Level 7 and Honours Bachelor degrees - Level 8. You can find
more information about these qualifications in our document on <a shape="rect" href="../colleges_and_qualifications/third_level_education_in_ireland.html">third-level
education in Ireland.</a> There is no central applications body for <a shape="rect" href="../../vocational_education_and_training/training_and_apprentiship_programmes/post_leaving_certificate_courses.html">Post-Leaving
Certificate (PLC) courses</a>. Students must apply directly to the individual
colleges.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.cao.ie/handbook.php">CAO provides a
handbook</a> that lists all the courses on offer and gives information on how
to apply. The closing date for 2016 applications from Irish and other European
Union nationals is 5.15 pm on 1 February 2016. Late applications are allowed up
to 5.15 pm on 1 May 2016.</p>

<p>Decisions on offers of places are normally made in August and September,
after the results of the Leaving Certificate have come out. A detailed <a href="http://www.cao.ie/index.php?page=correspondence_schedule&amp;bb=importantdates">schedule
of the offer rounds</a> is in the CAO handbook. </p>

<p><strong>CAO applications for 2016</strong></p>

<p>CAO will accept applications for the 2016/2017 academic year from Thursday,
5 November 2015 at 12 noon. </p>

<h3>Changing your mind</h3>

<p>It is possible to check and amend your online application free of charge up
to 5.15 p.m. on 31 January. From 5 February to 5.15 p.m. on 1 March, you can
amend your course choices for a fee of €10.</p>

<p>There is a further chance to change your mind, free of charge, from 5 May to
5.15 p.m. on 1 July. </p>

<h3>Courses in medicine</h3>

<p>EU applicants to undergraduate courses in medicine in 2016 must take the
Health Professions Admissions Test (HPAT). <a shape="rect" href="https://hpat-ireland.acer.edu.au/about-hpat-ireland">There is more
information on the HPAT-Ireland website.</a> You can find information about
graduate entry programmes in medicine in 2016 on the CAO website.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lc68a9">Entry requirements</h2>

<h4>Changes in 2017</h4>

<p>A new grading scheme for the Leaving Certificate will be introduced from
2017. The new scheme means that the Common Points Scale used by the CAO to
determine entry into higher education institutions, has also been revised. <a href="http://www.transition.ie/">You can read more on transition.ie </a><br></p>

<h3>Points</h3>

<p>Students who have taken the <a shape="rect" href="../../state_examinations/established_leaving_certificate.html">Leaving
Certificate examination</a> are allocated points for the results they get in
their 6 best subjects at a single sitting of the Leaving Certificate. The
points awarded depend on the level of achievement in the subject. You can use
the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.qualifax.ie/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;view=wrapper&amp;Itemid=75">points
calculator</a> on qualifax.ie to work out what points are awarded for any
particular set of results.</p>

<p>The number of entry-level points needed for any course depends on the number
of places and the number of applicants for those places so the entry level
varies from year to year. Higher points are awarded for Higher-Level papers
than for Ordinary-Level papers. </p>

<p>Under a 4-year pilot scheme operated from Leaving Certificate 2012, the
seven universities, Dublin Institute of Technology and the Royal College of
Surgeons in Ireland allocate <a href="http://www.iua.ie/students-graduates/admissions/bonus-points-for-maths/">extra
bonus points for Higher-Level mathematics</a>. </p>

<p>The CAO publishes the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.cao.ie/index.php?page=points">minimum points required for
admission to courses</a> as each round of offers is made. You can also check
the points required in previous years.</p>

<p>A student must also have the particular academic entry requirements (also
called matriculation requirements) for the course he or she wants to take. You
can find detailed information on the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.studentfinance.ie/mp7595/higher-education-institutions/index.html">websites
of the universities, institutes of technology and colleges of education</a>.</p>

<p><strong>If you have a disability</strong></p>

<p>You may qualify for the Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) scheme,
which aims to improve access to <a shape="rect" href="third_level_education_for_students_with_disabilities.html">higher
education for school-leavers with disabilities</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Higher Education Access Route (HEAR)</strong></p>

<p>The HEAR admissions scheme allocates a number of third-level places on a
reduced points basis to school-leavers from socially disadvantaged backgrounds.
To be eligible for the scheme you must meet certain criteria related to your
financial, social and cultural circumstances. Read more in <a shape="rect" href="third_level_admissions_scheme_for_students_from_disadvantaged_backgrounds.html">our
document on the HEAR scheme</a>.</p>

<p><strong>National University of Ireland:</strong> The minimum entry

<p>Places on <a href="../../vocational_education_and_training/post_leaving_certificate_courses.html">Post-Leaving

candidates to determine their suitability.<br></p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p><strong>Applying through the CAO:</strong> For participating higher
education institutions (HEIs), <a shape="rect" href="http://www.cao.ie/apply.php">you can apply online through the CAO.</a>
The opening date for the 2016 online application process is 5 November 2015.</p>

<p><strong>Other applications:</strong> You should apply directly to the HEI
(not through the CAO) in the following cases: </p>
<ul><li>Postgraduate courses. </li>
  <li>Entry to courses at post-initial-year level. </li>
  <li>Short duration, one-term, part-time and occasional courses. </li>
  <li>Re-admission to Dublin City University, Mary Immaculate College, Trinity
    College and University of Limerick. </li>
  <li>Follow-on courses at the institutes of technology. </li>
  <li>Any course not mentioned in the CAO Handbook. </li>
  <li>Certain mature applicants. </li>
  <li>Graduate/mature applicants to the Royal College of Surgeons. </li>
</ul><h3>Resident outside the EU</h3>

<p>If you are or have been resident outside the EU you may have to apply
directly to some HEIs. You need to contact the admissions office of HEIs to
enquire whether you should apply through the CAO or directly to the HEI.
<strong>It is very important to check application procedures for courses since
errors may be difficult or impossible to rectify. </strong></p>

<p>You should make your enquiries well before the closing date of 1 February,
preferably not later than the previous 15 December. </p>

education institution (HEI) to arrange the procedure. This means that you
cannot apply for such courses in a late application. The CAO publishes a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.cao.ie/index.php?page=testandinterviews">calendar
of these tests and interviews</a>. </p>

<p>The Higher Education Access Route (HEAR) is an admissions scheme for
students from socially disadvantaged backgrounds. The scheme aims to improve
access to college for school-leavers from socio-economic backgrounds that are
under-represented in third-level education. Under the HEAR scheme a number of
third-level places are allocated to school-leavers on a reduced points basis.
To be eligible for the scheme you must meet certain indicators or criteria
related to your financial, social and cultural circumstances – see
‘Indicators’ below. </p>

<h3>How the scheme works</h3>

<p>Each of the third-level colleges participating in the scheme has reserved a
number of places on its courses for school-leavers who are eligible for HEAR.
You can find details of the places available through HEAR on the <a shape="rect" href="http://accesscollege.ie/hear/participating-colleges/">websites of the
participating third-level colleges</a>. </p>

<p>You apply for HEAR through the Central Applications Office (CAO) – see
‘How to apply’ below. Once you have been accepted as eligible for HEAR, you
then compete for the reduced point places based on your Leaving Certificate
results. A <em>reduced point</em> <em>place</em> means that you may get a place
on a third-level course with fewer than the full CAO points. For example, if
you are eligible for HEAR and you get 350 Leaving Certificate points, you may
be offered a place on a course that is 360 points through CAO. However, you
must meet the college matriculation and any specific course entry
requirements.</p>

<h3>Additional supports</h3>

<p>If you get a place through HEAR you will also be offered a range of supports
while you are studying at college, such as an orientation programme, extra
tuition, study skills and mentoring. The supports available will vary from
college to college. </p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you wish to apply for a college place under the HEAR scheme you should <a shape="rect" href="http://www.cao.ie/apply.php">apply online through the
CAO</a>. The closing date for admission in autumn 2017 is <strong>1 February
2017</strong>. </p>

<p>When you are filling in the online CAO form you must complete the part of
the form to say you wish to apply for the HEAR scheme. You will then be
directed to a separate HEAR application form. You must complete this part of
your application by <strong>1 March 2017</strong>.</p>

<p>Then on the HEAR application form you must answer questions on your
family’s income, your parents’ employment status and the schools you
attended.</p>

<p>By <strong>1 April 2017</strong> your supporting documents must reach the
CAO, providing evidence of your circumstances. <strong>No applications will be
accepted after the closing dates.</strong> The closing dates are very strict
because HEAR is an additional application procedure which needs extra
processing time.</p>

<p>You will get a letter in late <strong>June 2017</strong> (after the Leaving
Certificate examination) telling you whether you are eligible for the scheme.
If you are told you are not eligible you can ask for your application to be
reviewed. Your HEAR application does not affect your CAO application, which
will be processed in the usual way after you get your Leaving Certificate
results. </p>

<p>The CAO helpline at (091) 509 800 can assist school-leavers with their HEAR
application. You can find further information in this <a shape="rect" href="http://accesscollege.ie/hear/frequently-asked-questions/">list of
frequently asked questions</a> on the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.accesscollege.ie/">Access College website</a>. You can also
contact the access services of the colleges participating in the HEAR scheme.
</p>

<p>The HEAR programme runs nationwide <a shape="rect" href="http://accesscollege.ie/hear/events/">information sessions</a> which aim
to answer questions that students (or their parents/guardians) may have about
preparing the application for HEAR.</p>

<p>You can download <a shape="rect" href="http://accesscollege.ie/hear/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/09/Higher-Education-Access-Route-HEAR-2016-Application-Guide-Workbook.pdf">application

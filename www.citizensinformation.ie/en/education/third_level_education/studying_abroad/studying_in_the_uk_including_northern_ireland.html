<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>If you are currently living in Ireland and thinking of doing a third-level
course in Northern Ireland (NI) or elsewhere in the United Kingdom (UK) there
is a very wide range of courses available. Many people choose to study in the
UK because a particular course is not available in Ireland or because the entry
requirements are easier. Others want to have the experience of studying outside
Ireland. Before you apply you should find out about the different structures
and costs for <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/hefce/2005/05_10/05_10.pdf">third-level
education in the UK (pdf)</a>, in particular fees and living costs. For
example, <a href="http://www.ucas.com/how-it-all-works/student-finance">there
are different fee arrangements within the UK</a>. The United Kingdom (UK)
includes England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. </p>

<p>Most UK undergraduate courses last 3 years but in Scotland they last 4
years. In addition the application process starts earlier than in Ireland. This
means you should begin looking at courses at least 12 months before you plan to
start studying. The application procedure for all UK undergraduate courses is
the same (see below for further details). </p>

<h3>Finding a course </h3>

<p>If you do not know the course you wish to study or if you want to find out
about different courses or colleges there are useful online resources to guide
you. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.educationuk.org/pls/hot_bc/page_pls_all_homepage">British
Council website Education UK</a> allows you to search for undergraduate and
postgraduate courses on a particular subject, in a particular university or in
a specific area such as Northern Ireland. It contains a summary of information
about each college or university with contact details and you can make online
request for brochures about the courses. It also has general information about
living in the UK including accommodation and working while studying. You can
find <a shape="rect" href="https://www.gov.uk/higher-education-courses-find-and-apply">information
about UK higher education institutions and courses</a> on the GOV.UK website.
</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Applying for an undergraduate course</h3>

<p>You may be eligible for a maintenance grant if you meet the criteria for the
<a href="../fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/maintenance_grant_schemes_for_students_on_third_level_courses.html">Student
Grant Scheme</a> - see 'How to apply' below.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.ucas.com/">UCAS (University and Colleges
Admissions Service)</a> is the central applications body for full-time
undergraduate courses at UK universities and colleges. Its website contains all
the information you need to apply to college including: how to apply, fees and
information about the colleges. Applications must be made online through the
UCAS website. You can apply through your school or as an individual.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.ucas.com/students/ucas_tariff/">Use the
UCAS tariff calculator</a> which is a points system used for entry to higher
education. It allows you to compare Leaving Certificate and GCSE A level
grades. A Leaving Certificate subject at honours level is approximately
equivalent to two-thirds of an A level. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="https://www.ucas.com/ucas/undergraduate/getting-started/when-apply">There
is a complete list of dates for applications on the UCAS website</a>.</p>

<h3>Postgraduate study</h3>

<p>There are 2 types of postgraduate study: taught courses and research. Taught
courses often last just 1 year while research can continue for 3 years or more.
You need to consider what kind of postgraduate study you wish to do, what are
the most suitable courses for you and your career and what costs are involved.
<a shape="rect" href="https://www.prospects.ac.uk/">Prospects</a> is the
official graduate prospects website for the UK. It has information on
postgraduate study, jobs and career advice. It has information on full-time and
part-time courses and you can search by geographical area and by subject. For
postgraduate courses in the UK you apply directly to the university or college.
Most of them have the application forms available online. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>As an EU national you will be treated in the same way as regards fees as UK
students. Tuition fees are not the only expense when studying in the UK you
also need to consider accommodation and living costs. </p>

<h3>Undergraduate courses<br></h3>

<p><strong>England, Wales and Northern Ireland:</strong> Since 2012-2013
universities and colleges can charge new students up to £9,000 sterling a year
for undergraduate courses. You can apply for a tuition fee loan which you only
have to repay after you have graduated and are earning over £21,000 sterling a
year. However, you are not entitled to maintenance support in the same way as
home students. If you are an EU national who has been settled in the UK for
over 3 years you will be classed as a home student and will be able to apply
for financial support for living costs.<br><strong>Scotland:</strong> Scottish students and EU students who start their
first full-time degree course in Scotland do not pay fees as long as they meet
the <a href="http://www.saas.gov.uk/_forms/residence.pdf">relevant residence
criteria (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Postgraduate courses</h3>

<p>The tuition fees for postgraduate study vary from institution to institution
and course to course, but usually run to several thousand pounds. Postgraduate
prospectuses give up-to-date fees. </p>

<p>There are different sources of funding for postgraduate students. Some
courses are advertised in the newspapers and include funding. Sometimes
financial support is available from the university that is running the
postgraduate course; sometimes you need to apply to an external body. Awards
are available for a range of subjects, both for taught courses and research
programmes. They vary as to amount, duration and whether they only cover fees
or include maintenance as well. There are strict eligibility rules and
deadlines for application and you should be aware that there are a large number
of postgraduates competing for limited funding.</p>

<p>A number of scholarships and fellowships for study abroad are awarded
annually by foreign governments to Irish students who are engaged in, or have
completed a course of third-level education. Further information may be
obtained from the International Section of the Department of Education and
Skills - see 'Where to apply' below. The <a shape="rect" href="http://universitiesireland.ie/bursaries-scholarships/">North-South
Masters Bursaries</a> fund a small number of Irish students to study in
Northern Ireland together with some Northern Irish students studying in
Ireland.</p>

<p>Check the following websites which have information on postgraduate
funding:<br><a shape="rect" href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/">Research Councils UK</a> <br><a shape="rect" href="https://www.prospects.ac.uk/">Prospects</a><br><a href="http://www.scholarship-search.org.uk/pls/mon/hc_edufin.page_pls_user_studmoney?x=16180339&amp;y=&amp;a=220707">Scholarship

<h3>Undergraduate courses</h3>

<p>If you need help or advice on your UCAS application contact the Customer
Service Unit and remember to quote your UCAS Personal ID/application number.</p>

<p>If you are an EU student, and applying through UCAS, they will send you an
application form for a tuition fee loan when you are offered a place on a
course. </p>

<p>You may be eligible for a maintenance grant if you meet the criteria for the
Irish <a shape="rect" href="../fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/maintenance_grant_schemes_for_students_on_third_level_courses.html">Student
Grant Scheme</a> but this does not include funding for tuition fees. You may
claim <a shape="rect" href="../fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/tax_relief_for_third_level_fees.html">tax
relief on third-level fees</a>. There is detailed information on the range of
Irish grants and funds for students in further and higher education at <a shape="rect" href="http://www.studentfinance.ie">studentfinance.ie</a>.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/education/student-finance">GOV.UK website</a>
has information on the financial supports available for EU students studying in
the UK including Northern Ireland.</p>

<h3>Postgraduate courses</h3>

<p>Funding is available under the Student Grant Scheme for postgraduate study
in Northern Ireland but not for postgraduate study in Britain. You may claim
tax relief on third-level fees.</p>

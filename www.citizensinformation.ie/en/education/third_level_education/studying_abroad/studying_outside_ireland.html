<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>If you are interested in studying in a European Union member state, another
European country or a country outside Europe this document covers the options
available to you. For information about the UK you can read our document about
<a shape="rect" href="studying_in_the_uk_including_northern_ireland.html">studying in the UK
including Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>People choose to study abroad for a number of reasons. Entry requirements
may be easier, you may have access to courses that are not available in Ireland
or you may simply want the experience of studying outside Ireland. It is
important to know the differences between studying in Ireland and studying
abroad. You should find out about the application procedures, length of
courses, fees and living expenses before you make a final decision on whether a
course of study abroad is suitable for you.</p>

<h3>Finding out about courses and studying abroad</h3>

<p>If you are a third-level student in Ireland your university or college may
have information about opportunities for studying outside Ireland. You can also
get information by applying directly to a third-level institution for a
prospectus. If you do not have a specific course or institution in mind, there
are a number of sources of information on studying abroad:</p>
<ul><li>The <a href="http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/education/university/index_en.htm">European
    Commission provides information about studying</a> in Europe. It provides
    information on admission, fees and other areas of interest while studying
    in Europe.. </li>
  <li>The <a shape="rect" href="http://europa.eu/youth/en">European Youth
    Portal</a> is a source of information for young people about <a shape="rect" href="http://europa.eu/youth/EU/education-and-training/school-and-university_en">studying
    in Europe</a> both in the European Union and in non-EU countries. It has
    information on a wide range of other topics for young people including <a shape="rect" href="http://europa.eu/youth/EU/employment-and-entrepreneurship/jobs_en">working</a>,
    <a shape="rect" href="http://europa.eu/youth/country/76/theme/117_en">travelling,</a> and
    <a shape="rect" href="http://europa.eu/youth/EU/voluntary-activities/volunteering-opportunities_en">volunteering</a>
    in Europe. </li>
  <li>UNESCO produces an international <a shape="rect" href="http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=41018&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html">guide
    to studying abroad.</a> It includes a searchable online database of
    higher-education study opportunities and the scholarships offered by higher
    education institutions and international organisations in many countries.
    It also has contact details and information on admission requirements,
    application deadlines, financial aid, fees, living expenses and other
    relevant information for all courses. </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.worldwide.edu">WorldWide Classroom</a>
    is a source of information on courses, student services and practical
    country information worldwide. You can use the international programme
    finder to search for a course in the country and language of your choice.
  </li>
</ul><h3>Student exchange programmes</h3>

<p>Many Irish third-level institutions offer their students the opportunity to
travel through their course of study, often through student exchange
programmes. Irish institutions establish initial contact with institutions
abroad and maintain an ongoing relationship with them. Students move between
the two institutions on study and work placements and are offered services such
as student orientation, language training, and accommodation services. Contact
your college for information about any student exchange programmes they may
offer.</p>
</div>

<p>The previous programmes have now closed and no further applications under
those programmes can be accepted. Existing projects funded by those programmes
will wind down over the next 1 - 3 years.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/european_education_programmes/eramus_plus.html">Erasmus+</a>
will provide opportunities for participants who include students and education
staff, to study, train, get work experience and volunteer abroad. In addition
to providing grants for individuals, Erasmus+ will support transnational
partnerships among education, training and youth institutions and
organisations. It will also support national efforts to modernise education,
training and youth systems. For the first time it will provide support to sport
initiatives.<br></p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l68288">Funding</h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.iefa.org/">International Education
Financial Aid (IEFA)</a> website provides a database of financial aid
information for students who want to study in a foreign country. The site
contains a comprehensive list of grants, scholarships, loan programmes and
other information that may be helpful to those interested in studying
abroad.</p>

<h3>EU grants <br></h3>

<p>Erasmus+ provides students with a mobility grant. </p>

<h3>Irish maintenance grants</h3>

<p>In Ireland maintenance grants under the <a href="../fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/maintenance_grant_schemes_for_students_on_third_level_courses.html">Student
Grants Scheme</a> are available for undergraduate courses of at least 2
yearsâ€™ duration in a publicly-funded third-level institution in another EU
member state. Depending on your income you may be eligible for a maintenance
grant provided that you fulfill the conditions as to residence, age, academic
attainments and nationality. You can find detailed information on the range of
Irish grants and funds for students in further and higher education on the
website <a shape="rect" href="http://www.studentfinance.ie">www.studentfinance.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>Funding for postgraduate study<br></h3>

<p>There are different sources of funding for postgraduate students. Some
courses are advertised in the newspapers and include funding. Sometimes
financial support is available from the university that is running the
postgraduate course; sometimes you need to apply to an external body. Awards
are available for a range of subjects, both for taught courses and research
programmes. They vary as to amount, duration and whether they only cover fees
or include maintenance as well. There are strict eligibility rules and
deadlines for application. In addition, there are a large number of
postgraduate students competing for limited funding.</p>

<p><strong>Postgraduate research/study scholarships:</strong> A number of
scholarships for study abroad are awarded annually by foreign governments to
Irish students who are engaged in, or have completed a course of third-level
education. Details of scholarships are circulated to universities and other
relevant third-level institutions of education. <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Learners/Services/Opportunities-to-study-abroad/">Details
of scholarships are also published on the Department of Education and Skills
website</a>. If you are interested in applying for these scholarships, you
should contact the International Section of the Department of Education and
Skills and ask to be placed on a mailing list for the scholarship offers.
Application forms and relevant details will then be posted to you when the
offers are open to receive applications.</p>

<h3>Tax relief on tuition fees<br></h3>

<p>If you are not eligible for a maintenance grant you or your parent may claim
<a shape="rect" href="../fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/tax_relief_for_third_level_fees.html">tax
relief on third-level fees</a> as follows: </p>

<p><strong>Undergraduate courses:</strong> Tax relief is available for tuition
paid for approved full-time/part-time undergraduate courses in both private and
publicly funded third-level colleges in any EU member state. It is also
available on full-time/part-time undergraduate courses operated by colleges in
any EU member state providing distance education in the State.</p>

<p><strong>Postgraduate courses:</strong> You can claim tax relief on
third-level fees for postgraduate courses in a university or publicly funded
college in another EU member state, including colleges that provide distance
education in the state. Tax relief is also available for postgraduate courses
in a university or publicly funded third-level college in non-EU countries.</p>

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The student grant scheme is the main financial support for students. The <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Learners/Information/Student-Grants/">scheme
is governed by legislation</a> made under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0004/index.html">Student
Support Act 2011</a>. Student grants are divided into maintenance grants, fee
grants and the postgraduate contribution. This document only deals with
undergraduates. Postgraduates can get information about financial assistance in
our document, <a href="postgraduate_student_grant.html">Postgraduate student
grants</a>.</p>

<p>Since 1 September 2015, <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Press-Events/Press-Releases/2015-Press-Releases/PR15-08-28.html">school
leavers who have been in the asylum protection system for 5 years and meet
certain criteria</a> can apply for student supports under the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Learners/Services/Pilot-Support-Scheme/">Pilot
Student Support Scheme</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Other financial supports to students</strong>: There is detailed
information on the range of grants and funds for students in further and higher
education on the website <a shape="rect" href="http://www.studentfinance.ie/">studentfinance.ie</a> for example it has
details of the <a href="http://www.studentfinance.ie/pca7575.html">Fund for
Students with Disabilities</a>, the <a href="http://www.studentfinance.ie/pca7235.html">Student Assistance Fund</a>
and some <a href="http://www.studentfinance.ie/mp9490/other-finance/index.html">third-level
scholarships</a>. </p>

<h3>Maintenance grants</h3>

<p>A maintenance grant is a contribution towards the student’s living costs.
Students who started or are starting courses from the academic year 2010-2011
onward do not qualify for a maintenance grant if they are on a <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">Back
to Education Allowance</a> or <a href="../../returning_to_education/vocational_training_opportunities_scheme.html">VTOS
allowance</a>.</p>

<p>Maintenance grants are available for approved courses below graduate level
in Ireland and other EU states. </p>

<h3>Fee grants</h3>

<p>A fee grant can cover any of the following 3 elements:</p>
<ul><li>All or part of the student contribution</li>
  <li>Costs of essential field trips</li>
  <li>All or part of a student’s tuition fees (unless covered by the Free
    Fees Scheme)</li>
</ul><p>In general, if you qualify for a maintenance grant you will qualify for all
elements of the fee grant. However, you will not get the tuition element of a
fee grant if you already qualify for free tuition under the <a href="fees.html">Free Fees Schemes</a>.</p>

<p>You may qualify for a fee grant, but not a maintenance grant, if you are a
'tuition student' under the Student Grant Scheme. A <a href="http://susi.ie/eligibility/undergraduate-student/residency-criteria/">tuition
student</a> is someone who fulfils all the conditions for a student grant
except for residence in the State, but who has been resident in an <a href="https://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Who-needs-an-Employment-Permit-/European-Economic-Area-EEA-/">EEA
state</a> or Switzerland for 3 of the last 5 years.</p>

<p>Students doing <a href="../../vocational_education_and_training/training_and_apprentiship_programmes/post_leaving_certificate_courses.html">Post-Leaving
Certificate (PLC) courses</a> do not get fee grants, but if you qualify for a
maintenance grant you will be exempt from the PLC participant contribution.</p>

<p>Fee grants are available for approved courses below graduate level in
Ireland. However, there are no fee grants for courses elsewhere in the EU.</p>

<p>See 'Approved courses and institutions' below for further detail.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l9807f">Qualifying for a student grant</h2>

<p>To qualify for a student grant, you must fulfil the conditions of the scheme
as regards:</p>
<ul><li>Nationality and immigration status</li>
  <li>Residence</li>
  <li>Means</li>
</ul><p>You must also be attending an approved course in an approved institution –
see ‘Approved courses and institutions’ below.</p>

<p>There are detailed conditions about the level of the course you are
attending; whether you have attended a course at the same level already; and
whether the course represents <strong>progression</strong> from your previous
studies. </p>

<p>In general, you will not get a grant for repeating a year or attending a
course at a level that does not represent progression from what you have done
before. However, <em>second-chance students</em> may be eligible for a grant. A
<em>second-chance student</em> is someone who is aged over 23, did not
successfully complete an earlier course and is returning to pursue an approved
course after at least 5 years.</p>

<p>If you qualify for a maintenance grant, you will qualify for all relevant
elements of a fee grant. You may qualify for a fee grant, but not a maintenance
grant, if you are what is called a <em>tuition student</em> under the Student
Grant Scheme. </p>

<p>A tuition student is someone who fulfils all the conditions for a student
grant except for residence in the State, but who has been resident in an <a href="https://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Who-needs-an-Employment-Permit-/European-Economic-Area-EEA-/">EEA
state</a> or Switzerland for 3 of the last 5 years. </p>

<h3>Nationality and immigration status</h3>

<p>In order to get a student grant you must be a national of an EEA member
state or Switzerland or have immigration status or leave to remain which is one
of the following:</p>
<ul><li>Family member of one of the above, with permission to remain in the State
    as a family member of such person under the European Communities (Free
    Movement of Persons) Regulations 2015 and EU Treaty rights provisions </li>
  <li>Refugee status </li>
  <li>Humanitarian leave to remain in the State before the Immigration Act 1999
    came into effect. Foreign nationals granted leave to remain under the Irish
    Born Child scheme - IBC/05 are not eligible. </li>
  <li>Permission to reside in the State under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/si/0426.html">European Union
    (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013</a>. </li>
  <li>Permission to remain following a determination not to make a deportation
    order </li>
  <li>Permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to, or civil
    partnership with, an Irish national living here or be the dependent child
    of a person with such permission </li>
</ul><h3>Residence</h3>

<p>You must have been ordinarily resident in the State for 3 of the previous 5
years to qualify for a maintenance grant. However, if you are studying
elsewhere in the EU for a recognised qualification, and you were resident in
the State for 3 of the 5 years before starting that course, you satisfy this
requirement. <a href="http://www.studentfinance.ie/mp9546/step-2-check-your-residency-status/index.html"></a></p>

<p>If you fulfil all the criteria for a maintenance grant except for the
residence condition in the State, you may still qualify for a fee grant or a
postgraduate fee contribution as a tuition student.</p>

<p>A tuition student is someone who fulfils all the conditions for a student
grant except for residence in the State, but who has been resident in an EEA
state or Switzerland for 3 of the last 5 years.The members of the EEA (the
European Economic Area) are the member states of the EU, along with Iceland,
Norway and Liechtenstein.</p>

<h3>Means test</h3>

<p>The means test for a student grant in 2016-2017 is based on your family's
gross income for the previous full tax year (2015). However, if you or your
family have had a <a href="http://susi.ie/quick-links/change-in-circumstances/">change of
circumstances<strong></strong></a> (which is likely to be permanent) since 31
December 2015, your changed circumstances may be taken into account.<a href="http://www.studentfinance.ie/mp9556/check-reckonable-income-limits/index.html"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://susi.ie/eligibility/income/">Reckonable income</a> for a
student grant is gross income from all sources. Some social welfare payments
are excluded from 'reckonable income' for the purposes of student grants - see
<a href="http://susi.ie/eligibility/income/">more details on reckonable income
on susi.ie</a> and also in the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2016/en.si.2016.0153.pdf">Student
Grant Scheme 2016 (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>If you were ordinarily resident with your parents from October 1 of the year
before the year of entry to the course, you are considered <strong>dependent on
your parents</strong> and your income (if any) is assessed together with your
parents' income(s). An allowance is made for your earnings outside of term-time
– up to €4,500. Outside term time is 2 weeks at Christmas, 2 weeks at
Easter and 12 weeks during the summer months of June, July and August only.
(Holiday pay earned outside these periods may also be allowed by the grant
awarding authority on receipt of a letter from the school/college confirming
the exact dates of term).</p>

<p><strong>Independent mature candidates</strong> are candidates aged 23 or
over on 1 January in the year of entry to the course. To be assessed as an
independent mature candidate you must also live separately from your parents
from 1 October of the year before the year of entry to the course. If you are
an independent student, you are assessed on your own income (and that of your
spouse, civil partner or cohabitant, if applicable).</p>

<p>The only points at which you can be reclassified from a dependent student to
an independent student are when you:</p>
<ul><li>Progress from further education to higher education or</li>
  <li>Have a 3 year break in your studies or</li>
  <li>Are returning as a <em>second-chance student</em> after a 5 year break in
    your studies.</li>
</ul><h3>Income limits for maintenance grant and full fee grant</h3>

<p>The family income limits for eligibility for a <strong>maintenance</strong>
<strong>grant</strong> in 2016-2017 are set out below. These income limits are
applied after your means are assessed - see 'Means test' above. The income
limits also apply to the <strong>fee</strong> <strong>grant</strong> (that is,
if you don't qualify for the free fees scheme and are eligible for a fee
grant). </p>

    categories<strong></strong>by €4,830<strong></strong> </li>
  <li>In <strong></strong>part maintenance 75%, 50% and 25%
    categories<strong></strong>by €4,670 </li>
</ul><p>If you are an independent applicant, the family member taken into account is
your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant. If you are dependent on your parents,
the family members taken into account are your parent(s) and their other
dependent children.</p>

<h3>Special rates of grants for disadvantaged students</h3>

<p>Disadvantaged students who meet a number of conditions can qualify for a
special rate of maintenance grant. </p>

<p>Applicants must have qualified for the standard maintenance grant for the
academic year 2016-2017 and total reckonable income in the tax year January to
December 2015 must not be more than €22,703, not including Qualified Child
Increases and standard exclusions. </p>

<p>For students, including mature students, who are assessed on
parent(s)/guardian's income, their parent(s)/guardian must, on 31 December
2015, have been:</p>
<ul><li>Claiming long-term social welfare payments, or </li>
  <li>Claiming Family Income Supplement or </li>
  <li>Participating in designated programmes (for example, a Community
    Employment Scheme). </li>
</ul><p>These payments and programmes are listed in Schedule 2 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2016/en.si.2016.0153.pdf">Student
Grant Scheme 2016 (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>For students who are assessed on their own income, on 31 December 2015 the
student must have been getting one of these social welfare payments or
participating in a designated programme.</p>

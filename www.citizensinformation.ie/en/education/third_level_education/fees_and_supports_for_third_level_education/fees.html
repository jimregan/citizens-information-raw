<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>Most undergraduate students attending publicly funded third-level courses do
not have to pay tuition fees. Under the terms of the <a href="http://www.studentfinance.ie/mp9377/course-fees/index.html">Free Fees
Initiative</a>, the Department of Education and Skills pays the fees to the
colleges instead.</p>

<p>A separate annual charge is payable to colleges for the costs of student
services and examinations – see ‘Student contribution’ below.</p>

<p>Charges for Post-Leaving Certificate courses (PLCs) operate under different
rules - see <a href="../../vocational_education_and_training/training_and_apprentiship_programmes/post_leaving_certificate_courses.html">our
document on PLCs</a>.</p>

<h3>Free fees</h3>

<h3></h3>

<p>To qualify for free fees, you must meet criteria with regard to:</p>
<ul><li>Residence and</li>
  <li>Nationality and immigration status and</li>
  <li>Course requirements</li>
</ul><p><strong>Residence</strong></p>

<p>You must have been living in an EEA member state or Switzerland <strong>for
at least 3 of the 5 years before starting your course</strong>. The members of
the EEA (the European Economic Area) are the member states of the EU, along
with Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.</p>

<p><strong>Nationality and immigration</strong></p>

<p>You must also fulfil <strong>one</strong> of the following 6 criteria as
regards nationality and immigration status in Ireland:</p>

<p>You must:</p>
<ol><li>Be a citizen of an EEA member state (see above) or Switzerland or</li>
  <li>Have official <a href="../../../moving_country/asylum_seekers_and_refugees/refugee_status_and_leave_to_remain/rights_of_convention_programme_refugees_people_given_leave_to_remain.html">refugee
    status</a> or</li>
  <li>Be a <a href="../../../moving_country/asylum_seekers_and_refugees/refugee_status_and_leave_to_remain/family_reunification_for_refugees_in_ireland.html">family
    member of a refugee</a> and have been granted permission to live in the
    State or</li>
  <li>Be a <a href="../../../moving_country/moving_to_ireland/rights_of_residence_in_ireland/residence_rights_eu_national.html">family
    member of an EU national</a> and have permission to live in the State, with
    a stamp “4EUFAM” on your residence card or</li>
  <li>Have been granted humanitarian <a href="../../../moving_country/asylum_seekers_and_refugees/refugee_status_and_leave_to_remain/leave_to_remain.html">leave
    to remain</a> in the State or</li>
  <li>Have been granted permission to remain in the State by the Minister for
    Justice and Equality, following a determination by the Minister not to make
    a deportation order under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Course requirements</strong></p>

<p>You must also fulfil <strong>all</strong> of the following 3 course
requirements:</p>
<ol><li>You must be undertaking a full-time undergraduate course of at least 2
    years' duration (or certain shorter courses in institutes of
  technology).</li>
  <li>You must be a first-time full-time undergraduate. However, students who
    already hold a Level 6 or a Level 7 qualification and are progressing to a
    Level 8 qualification on the <a href="http://www.nfq.ie/nfq/en/about_NFQ/framework_levels_award_types.html">National
    Framework of Qualifications</a> without having received an exemption from
    the normal duration of the course may be deemed eligible for free fees.
    Also, you may be eligible for Free Fees, if you attend a course but did not
    complete it and are returning following a break of at least five years to
    pursue an approved course at the same level.</li>
  <li>In general, you must not be repeating the year because of failing your
    exams or changing course. This requirement may be waived if you repeat a
    year due to certified serious illness. </li>
</ol><p>The undergraduate courses for which the free fees arrangements apply are
courses in: </p>
<ul><li>Universities </li>
  <li>Institutes of technology </li>
  <li>Publicly funded colleges of education </li>
  <li>National College of Ireland </li>
  <li>A number of religious education institutions </li>
</ul><p>Free fees do <span>not </span>apply to courses in private colleges, whether
they have <a shape="rect" href="http://www.qqi.ie/">Quality and Qualifications
Ireland (QQI)</a> approval or not. The fact that a course is listed by the <a shape="rect" href="http://cao.ie/index.php">Central Applications Office</a>
(CAO) is not, in itself, enough to make it a <em>free fees</em> course.</p>

<p>Detailed information about assistance with tuition fees is available on <a shape="rect" href="http://www.studentfinance.ie/mp9377/course-fees/index.html">studentfinance.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>EU fees</h3>

<h3></h3>

<p>If you do not qualify for free fees you may still be eligible for <em>EU fee
rates</em>. EU fee rates are set by each individual third-level educational
institution. You should contact the one you are interested in to find out about
the EU fee rate and whether you qualify.</p>

<p>Some examples of when people might qualify for an EU fee rate are as
follows: </p>
<ul><li>You originally qualified for free fees and are now <strong>repeating a
    year</strong> that you failed.</li>
  <li>You do not fulfil any of the 6 nationality and immigration status
    criteria listed above but have been <strong>tax resident</strong> for a
    number of years in an EEA member state or Switzerland. (However, as the
    third-level institutions are autonomous bodies, this is at the discretion
    of the institution concerned.)</li>
</ul><p><strong>From September 2014</strong>, an Irish, EU, EEA or Swiss student who
has spent at least five years in primary school or second level school in
Ireland can avail of EU fee rates. </p>

<p>If you do not qualify for EU fees you can be charged non-EU fees. Each
third-level educational institution sets its own fee rates. You should contact
the ones you are interested in to find out more about their fees - see 'Where
to apply' below.</p>

<h3>Postgraduate fees</h3>

<p>In general, you will have to pay fees for a postgraduate course. However,
you may get <a href="postgraduate_student_grant.html">financial assistance
under the Student Grant Scheme.</a></p>

<p>Postgraduates under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.education.ie/en/Press-Events/Press-Releases/2013-Press-Releases/PR13-02-01A.html">Graduate
Skills Conversion Programme</a>, courses are free, full-time and intensive.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="ld8ce9">Student contribution</h2>

<p>Most colleges charge an annual student contribution, formerly called the
student services charge. It is also known as a registration fee and it covers
student services and examinations. The amount of the contribution varies from
one institution to another. The maximum rate of the student contribution for
the academic year 2017-2018 is €3,000.</p>

<p>If you are getting <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">Back
to Education Allowance</a> (BTEA) you may qualify for exemption from the
student contribution. More information about the BTEA and the student
contribution can be found in our document about <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/back_to_education/social_welfare_payments_and_the_student_maintenance_grant_for_the_2010_11_academic_year.html">social
welfare payments and the student grant</a>.</p>

<h3>Student grants </h3>

<p>Student grants provide financial support to eligible students. There are 2
elements to the student grant - a maintenance grant and a fee grant. A
maintenance grant is a contribution towards your living costs. A fee grant can
cover:</p>
<ul><li>All or part of your tuition fees</li>
</ul><ul><li>All or part of the student contribution</li>
</ul><ul><li>Costs of essential field trips</li>
</ul><p>If you have qualified for a maintenance grant, you will generally qualify
for a fee grant.</p>

<p>If you do not qualify for a maintenance grant, but your family’s
reckonable income is below certain limits, you may qualify for a partial fee
grant. This means that you will either be exempt from 50% of the student
contribution, or exempt from 50% of any tuition fees and all of the student
contribution.</p>

<p>The Student Grant Scheme is described in our document on <a href="maintenance_grant_schemes_for_students_on_third_level_courses.html">Grants
for students in further and higher education</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Tax relief</strong></h3>

<p>You may be able to claim tax relief on tuition fees that you have paid.
Families who pay student contributions for more than one student in a year can
also claim tax relief on the second and subsequent contributions. Read more in
<a href="tax_relief_for_third_level_fees.html">our document on tax relief
for third-level fees</a>. <br></p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you wish to enter or return to third-level education and you are over 23
years of age, Irish third-level colleges have <a shape="rect" href="../applying_to_college/third_level_courses_for_mature_students.html">places
for mature students</a>. You will have to consider the costs of fees and
maintenance, depending on whether you are going to do a full-time or a
part-time course. Depending on your circumstances, you may be eligible for <a href="fees.html">free fees</a>. If you are planning to study full-time as an
<strong>undergraduate</strong>, you may be eligible for a student grant. (If
you are applying for an undergraduate course and you have already completed an
undergraduate course, you are <strong>not</strong> eligible for either a
student grant or free fees.)</p>

<p>If you are applying for a <strong>postgraduate</strong> course you will have
to pay fees, unless you get a partial student grant. You will also have to pay
fees if you are intending to study part-time or do a distance learning course.
If you do have to pay fees you may be able to get <a shape="rect" href="tax_relief_for_third_level_fees.html">tax relief at the standard
rate.</a></p>

<p>The website <a shape="rect" href="http://www.studentfinance.ie/">studentfinance.ie</a> has detailed
information on the range of grants and funds for students in further and higher
education. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lc6050">Schemes to help with fees and
maintenance</h2>

<p>If you satisfy certain criteria and attend courses approved by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.education.ie/">Department of Education and
Skills</a>, you may qualify for help with fees and maintenance throughout the
period of your studies. Since 2011, a single Student Grant Scheme is in
operation. The following support schemes that applied to mature students have
been merged into this single scheme:</p>
<ul><li>Higher Education Grants Scheme</li>
  <li>Vocational Education Committees' Scholarship Scheme</li>
</ul><p>Since 2011, mature students who get student grants no longer automatically
qualify for the higher (non-adjacent) rate of grant. From 2012 onwards, new
postgraduate students will not qualify for a full student grant. </p>

<p>If you are getting an unemployment, one-parent family or disability payment,
the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">Back
to Education Allowance (BTEA)</a> allows you to study at second and third level
without losing your benefits. You must meet certain criteria to be eligible for
the <acronym title="Back to Education Allowance">BTEA</acronym>. If you are
studying part-time you may be able to keep your benefits under the <a href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/back_to_education/back_to_education_programme.html">Back
to Education Programme. </a></p>

<p>Since 2010, people who are getting Back to Education Allowance and those on
<a href="../../vocational_education_and_training/training_and_apprentiship_programmes/post_leaving_certificate_courses.html">Post-Leaving
Certificate courses</a> who are getting <a href="../../returning_to_education/vocational_training_opportunities_scheme.html">VTOS
allowances</a> are not eligible for student support grants. However, this does
not affect any entitlement they may have to exemption from college fees or the
Student Contribution so they should still complete a grant application.</p>

Grant Scheme</a> and about <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/back_to_education/social_welfare_payments_and_the_student_maintenance_grant_for_the_2010_11_academic_year.html">social

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l4c026">Other funds</h2>

<p>There are several other funds available to support you in third-level
education. These include: </p>

<p><strong>Fund for students with disabilities</strong></p>

<p>If you have a disability, you may be entitled to some financial support. The
Department of Education and Skills administers a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.studentfinance.ie/pca7575.html">special fund that helps
students with disabilities</a> during the period of their studies. </p>

<p><strong>Student Assistance Fund <br></strong>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.studentfinance.ie/pca7235.html">Student Assistance Fund</a> is
for students who, having started a third-level course, experience financial
hardship and, therefore, may be unable to continue their studies. Applications
for funding should be made by the individual student to the access/disability
officer in their college. The Fund is administered on a confidential,
discretionary basis.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l1781d">Studying abroad</h2>

<p>If you plan to <a shape="rect" href="../studying_abroad/">study abroad,</a>
you may be eligible for a student grant from the Irish Government. A range of
approved undergraduate courses in the UK and in other European Union states are
covered. Find out more about <a shape="rect" href="../../european_education_programmes/">European education
programmes</a>.</p>

<p>Under the Student Grant Scheme there are no age limits for the student
grants for studying in another EU state but it must be your first undergraduate
course.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>Generally each college has a mature students officer who can provide
information about supports for mature students.</p>

<p><strong>The Special Fund for People with Disabilities</strong> <br>
You need to contact the Student Counsellor or Disability Support Officer at the
college of your choice when you are registering. </p>

<p><strong>Studying abroad</strong> <br>
If you are a citizen of the European Union, you have the right to go to any
other EU state to study. The EU has published a series of guides about living,
working, studying and moving within the EU which will explain your rights. You
can then make the most of the opportunities available to you. If you are
interested in <a shape="rect" href="../studying_abroad/studying_in_the_uk_including_northern_ireland.html">studying
in the UK</a>, for example, you should contact the British Council in order to
get full information on the courses available and the application procedures
for each course. </p>

<p>If you are interested in studying outside of the EU, you should get in touch
with the Irish embassy/consulate in that state for further information. </p>

<p><strong>Student grants</strong></p>

<p>Since 2012-2013 on, Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) handles all new
applications for student grants. Renewals of existing grants are handled by the
VEC or local authority that issued them initially. Since 1 July 2013, VEC were
replaced by Education and Training Boards (ETBs).</p>

<p>All new grant applications must be made online.<a href="https://www.grantsonline.ie/"></a></p>

Education Programme, apply on <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/bte1.pdf">form BTE1 (pdf)</a>.</p>

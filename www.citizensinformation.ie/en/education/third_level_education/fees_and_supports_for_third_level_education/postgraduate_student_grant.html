<p>Students enrolling in postgraduate courses may get financial assistance
under the Student Grant Scheme. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l992a7">Postgraduate student grant</h2>

<p>Postgraduates may get financial assistance under the Student Grant Scheme
with the cost of tuition fees for approved postgraduate courses in Ireland and
Northern Ireland. There is no assistance under the Scheme for courses elsewhere
in the EU.</p>

<p>There are 2 ways postgraduates may qualify for assistance under the Student
Grant Scheme. They may either:</p>

<p>1.Get a new flat rate fee contribution of €2,000, if they pass the
<strong>fee contribution means test</strong> – see below</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>2.Get all their tuition fees paid and essential field trips (up to
€6,270), if they meet the qualifying conditions for the <strong>special rate
of grant for disadvantaged students</strong> – see below</p>

<p>No maintenance grant is paid to new postgraduate students since 2012.</p>

<p>To qualify for assistance under the Student Grant Scheme you must also meet
the criteria for nationality and immigration status, and residency. More
information about these criteria can be found in our document on <a href="maintenance_grant_schemes_for_students_on_third_level_courses.html">Grants
for student in further and higher education</a>.</p>

<h3>Fee contribution means test</h3>

<p>The means test may be carried out on your income or your parent’s income.
It will depend on whether you are an independent mature student or dependent on
your parents.</p>

<p>If you were ordinarily resident with your parents from October 1 of the year
before the year of entry to higher education on an approved course, you are
considered <strong>dependent on your parents</strong>. In this case, your
income (if any) is assessed together with your parents' income(s). An allowance
is made for a certain amount of your earnings outside of term-time (up to
€4,500).</p>

<p><strong>Independent students</strong> are mature students aged over 23 who
live separately from their parents from 1 October of the year before the year
of entry to higher education on an approved course. If you are an independent
student, you are assessed on your own income (and that of your spouse, civil
partner or cohabitant, if applicable).</p>

<p>If you were classified as a dependent student you cannot be reclassified as
an independent student unless there is a 3-year break in your studies.</p>

<p>The means test for the fee contribution under the Student Grant Scheme in
2017-2018 is based on your family's reckonable income for the previous full tax
year (2016). If your family’s reckonable income is over the limit set by the
Department of Education and Skills you will not qualify for the fee
contribution. Some social welfare payments are excluded from 'reckonable
income' for the purposes of the means test - see <a href="http://susi.ie/eligibility/income/">more details on reckonable income on
susi.ie</a> and also in the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2017/en.si.2017.0125.pdf">Student
Grant Scheme 2017</a>.</p>

<p>If you or your family has had a <a href="http://susi.ie/quick-links/change-in-circumstances/">change of
circumstances</a> after 31 December 2016, which has reduced your income
permanently, your new reckonable income may be taken into account.</p>

<p>If you are eligible for full assistance with the tuition fee from any other
source, including sponsorship or an award, you will not qualify for the
postgraduate fee contribution. If you are eligible for partial assistance, your
postgraduate fee contribution will be reduced by the amount of assistance you
receive.</p>

<h4>Income limits for the fee contribution</h4>

<p>The family income limits for eligibility for a postgraduate fee contribution
in 2017-2018 are set out in the table below.</p>

<table border="1"><caption></caption>
  <col><col><tbody><tr><td>Number of dependent children</td>
      <td>Reckonable income limits</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Fewer than 4</td>
      <td>€31,500</td>
    </tr><tr><td>4-7</td>
      <td>€34,615</td>
    </tr><tr><td>8 or more</td>
      <td>€37,580</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>The reckonable income limits may be increased by €4,980 for each
additional family member who is pursuing a full-time course of at least one
year’s duration.</p>

<p>If you are an independent student, the family member taken into account is
your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant. If you are dependent on your parents,
the family members taken into account are your parent(s) and their other
dependent children.</p>

<h3>Special rate of grant for disadvantaged students</h3>

<p>Disadvantaged postgraduate students who meet a number of conditions can get
tuition fees paid and essential field trips (up to €6,270).</p>

<p><strong>New postgraduate student grant applications</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.grantsonline.ie/">Student Universal Support Ireland
(SUSI)</a> is the new single grant-awarding authority. It handles all new grant
applications from 2012.</p>

<p>Your grant/fee contribution will be awarded when you confirm acceptance of
your place (usually late August/early September). SUSI will pay it into your
designated Irish bank account.</p>

<p><strong>Renewal of student grant applications</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">Local
authorities</a> deal with renewal grant applications for postgraduate students
getting a grant before the 2012-2013 academic year.</p>

<p>Student grants are reviewed each year. If you had a grant in one academic
year and are continuing your studies on the course in the following year, the
body that awarded the grant will be in contact with you in order to renew or
re-assess your student grant for that next year.</p>

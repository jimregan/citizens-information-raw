<p>Under the <a href="https://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2Fchildcare%2FCCSDocsJune2012%2FCCSMainPage.htm&amp;mn=chir&amp;nID=4">Community
Childcare Subvention (CCS) Programme</a> disadvantaged parents and parents in
training, education or low paid employment can avail of childcare at reduced
rates. The childcare is provided by community-based (not-for-profit) childcare
services who are participating in the CCS Programme.</p>

<p>The childcare service may offer the following:</p>
<ul><li>Full day care places (more than 5 hours per day)</li>
  <li>Part-time places (between 3 hours 31 minutes and 5 hours)</li>
  <li>Sessional places (between 2 hours 16 minutes and 3 hours 30 minutes)</li>
  <li>Half-session places (between 1 hour and 2 hours 15 minutes)</li>
</ul><p>Community-based childcare services may offer a range of child care under the
CCS programme. They may even run a breakfast club. However, some childcare
services operating the CCS programme may offer just one type of service, for
example afterschool care.</p>

<p>Parents cannot get the <a href="early_childhood_care_and_education_scheme.html">Early Childhood Care
and Education Scheme</a> and a CCS fee reduction at the same time. You can
decide which scheme would of greater benefit to you. </p>

<p><strong>Free childcare for homeless children</strong></p>

<p>From January 2017, Children aged 0-5 years whose parents are homeless (and
those transitioning from homelessness to permanent accommodation) will be
offered free childcare for 25 hours a week. This <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=4073">free childcare for
homeless children</a> includes 15 hours of free pre-school (ECCE) where
children are eligible or school hours. It will also include a daily meal.
Parents will not be asked to pay any top–up or co-payment for these part-time
hours.</p>

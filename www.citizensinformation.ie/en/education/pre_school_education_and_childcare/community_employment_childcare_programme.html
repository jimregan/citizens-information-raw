<p>The number of places available under the CEC Programme is limited. Places
are allocated on a first-come first-served basis.</p>

<p>You may qualify for a childcare place while on CE if:</p>
<ul><li>You have been offered a place on a CE scheme</li>
  <li>You are the main carer of a child or children</li>
  <li>You need assistance with child care in order to take up a place on a CE
    scheme</li>
</ul><p>Places will be provided for 50 weeks in a 12-month period. If you are absent
from CE for a prolonged period you will not be able to avail of child care
through the CEC Programme.</p>

<p><strong>Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme</strong></p>

<p>If your child is participating in <a href="early_childhood_care_and_education_scheme.html">Early Childhood Care
and Education (ECCE)</a> Scheme at the same time as you are on CE (either
morning or afternoon), that child cannot transfer to a childcare place on the
CEC Programme. However, if a you are attending CE on an alternative time of day
to the child's ECCE programme you can also avail of a childcare place on the
CEC Programme while you are on CE.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>The CE sponsor will tell you about the CEC Programme and give you a list of
childcare providers participating in the programme. You should then contact a
childcare provider in your area to book a childcare place under the CEC
Programme . You can use your letter of offer of a CE place to do this.</p>

<p>If you are already on CE, your sponsor will give you a letter stating this.
The childcare provider will accept your letter and offer you a place, if there
are places available.</p>

<p>If you cannot find a place for your child you should contact your <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2FECCE-Scheme%2F20160628CityandCountyChildcareCommitteesContactJune2016.xls&amp;mn=chim&amp;nID=6">local

<p>The Early Start Programme is a one-year preventative intervention scheme
offered in selected schools in designated disadvantaged areas. The objective of
the pre-school programme, which is managed, funded and evaluated by the
Department of Education and Skills, is to tackle educational disadvantage by
targeting children who are at risk of not reaching their potential within the
school system. </p>

<p>Children must be aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7
months on the 1st day of September of the year in which they are enrolled.</p>

<p>Children may either be enrolled in Early Start or in the Free Pre-school
Year Scheme. Children are not eligible to be enrolled in both schemes at the
same time.</p>

<p>The Early Start Pre-School Programme was introduced in 1994. You can get <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/Grants-and-Additional-Support/Early-Start-Programme/Early-Start-Units-List.pdf">a
list of the schools in the Early Start Programme (pdf)</a> on the Department of
Education and Skills website.</p>

<p>The aims of Early Start are:</p>
<ul><li>To implement an educational programme that will enhance the overall
    development of young children and prevent school failure </li>
  <li>To counteract the effects of social disadvantage. </li>
</ul><p>The desired outcomes of Early Start are:</p>
<ul><li>That the children involved in the programme will develop confidence in
    their ability to learn </li>
  <li>That the children involved in the programme will develop learning styles,
    which are led by motivated, organised and appropriately independent
    behaviour </li>
  <li>That the children involved in the programme will develop their language,
    cognition and social/personal skills to the extent that they will be able
    to easily adapt to school life in the future </li>
  <li>That the 'learning through play' approach used in the programme will be
    positive and enjoyable for the children involved </li>
  <li>That the parents of participating children will become actively involved
    in their children's education. </li>
</ul><h3>How Early Start operates</h3>

<p>Early Start pre-schools are accommodated in vacant classrooms in primary
schools. The teachers and childcare workers in Early Start are members of staff
and are under the general supervision of the Board of Management and the
principal teacher. Early Start is regarded as an integral part of the primary
school and benefits from the managerial and administrative services of the
school.</p>

<p>A full unit caters for a total of 60 children and a half-unit caters for 30.
Each teacher and childcare worker caters for 15 children between 09.00 and
11.30 and a different 15 from 12.00 to 14.30 each day. A full Early Start unit
is staffed by 2 trained teachers, 2 trained childcare workers and parent
volunteers. A half-unit is staffed by one trained teacher and a trained
childcare worker. The board of management of the school where Early Start is
established appoints the childcare workers and the principal of the school
assigns the teachers to work in Early Start.</p>

<p><span>Parental involvement is also a key element in the Early Start
project</span>, both in everyday management and in the organisation of
activities. Working in conjunction with the school's <a shape="rect" href="../primary_and_post_primary_education/attendance_and_discipline_in_schools/home_school_liaison.html">Home
School Community Liaison</a> Co-ordinator, the Early Start staff encourage
parents to take part in the centre's activities. A rota is agreed and parents
take turns to spend time each week in the centre. </p>

<p>The curriculum of the programme prioritises the four core areas of language,
cognition and social and personal development. This is done by engaging the
children in structured play activities, aimed at enhancing their development in
the core areas. Within these play activities, teachers set specific learning
objectives for each child. Play and positive adult-child interaction are the
cornerstones of the Early Start activities. </p>

<p>After completing the Early Start programme, children proceed to the junior
infants class. </p>

<h3>Qualifications</h3>

<p>The teachers are fully qualified primary school teachers. </p>

full-time <a href="http://www.qqi.ie/Pages/Programme-Validation07.aspx">QQI</a>

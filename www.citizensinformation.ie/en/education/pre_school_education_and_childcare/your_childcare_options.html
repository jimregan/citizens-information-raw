<p>Deciding on childcare is a big decision for any parent. There are a number
of factors that will make an impact on your final decision. These include:</p>
<ul><li>Your child’s age </li>
  <li>Whether you need full or part-time care </li>
  <li>The hours you need services (regular, daytime, evenings or weekends) </li>
  <li>Your budget </li>
  <li>Services available in your area. </li>
</ul><p>It is important to discuss with the childcare service provider your
child’s needs and the service they can provide. You should check that staff
are qualified and the provider has appropriate childcare policies and
procedures in place for example, child protection, behaviour management and
accidents. It is also important to check fees, hours, and holiday periods. Make
sure to visit when there are children present, so you get a feel for the
atmosphere. The Child and Family Agency (Tusla) has published a useful list of
<a href="http://www.tusla.ie/services/preschool-services/tips-for-parents">tips
on choosing a pre-school</a>. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs
(DCYA) has published a <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2Fchildcare%2Fqualifications.htm&amp;mn=chie&amp;nID=9">list
of recognised qualifications</a> for the purposes of the DCYA childcare
programmes.</p>

<p>By law, pre-school childcare facilities must notify and be inspected by the
Child and Family Agency. You can access the <a href="http://www.tusla.ie/services/preschool-services/early-years-pre-school-inspection-services/where-to-get-an-inspection-report-for-a-service">Child
and Family Agency inspection reports on childcare services</a>. More detailed
information about the <a shape="rect" href="health_safety_and_welfare_of_preschool_childcare_services.html">regulation
of childcare services</a> is available from the Child and Family Agency - see
'Where to apply' below. </p>

<p>Your City or County Childcare Committee can provide a list of childcare
providers in your area. They can also put you in touch with your local early
years/pre-school inspector -see 'How to apply' below. </p>

<h2>Types of childcare options</h2>

<p>Some childcare options may be distinguished simply by their opening hours or
management structures, and others by the curriculum of education that they use.
You can read more about <a href="early_childhood_education.html">early
childhood education</a>. Staff training can also determine the type of service
available, as can the general needs of parents in your area. Different types of
childcare services include: </p>

<p><strong>Full day care</strong><br>
This is a structured care service for more than 5 hours per day and may include
a sessional service. Providers care for children from 3 months to 6 years. Some
may also include an after-school facility. In full day care, sleeping
arrangements and food preparation must meet standards laid down by the Child
and Family Agency. Providers include day nurseries and crèches.</p>

<p><strong>Sessional services<br></strong>These services offer a planned programme consisting of up to 3.5 hours
per session (such as a morning or an afternoon). Generally, they cater for
children from 3 to 5 years of age. These services may also be provided for
younger children. In order to provide a sessional childcare service, a
recognised childcare qualification is required. Sessional services include:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Montessori groups</strong> focus on individualised education,
    teaching social skills and maximising children’s development. They cater
    to children up to the age of 6. </li>
  <li><strong>Parent and toddler groups</strong> are where a group of parents,
    guardians or carers and children come together for supervised play and
    companionship for their parents. </li>
  <li><strong>Naíonraí</strong> are nursery schools or playschools operating
    through Irish. </li>
  <li><strong>Playschools</strong> give children an opportunity to play with
    other children of a similar age, learn to share and take turns and to
    understand the rules of the classroom, such as listening. </li>
  <li><strong>Early Start Programme</strong> is a one-year preventative
    intervention scheme offered in selected schools in designated disadvantaged
    areas to three- and four-year-old children.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Childminders</strong><br>
Childminders care for children in the minder’s own home. A childminder can
care for up to 5 children under 6 years of age (including the childminder’s
own). The service is usually offered for the full working day or for different
periods during the day. Parents and childminders arrange their own terms and
conditions.</p>

<p>As part of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.omc.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2Fchildcare%2Fchildminders.htm&amp;mn=chiy&amp;nID=5">National
Childminding Initiative</a>, childminding development grants and <a shape="rect" href="http://www.omc.gov.ie/documents/childcare/guidelines_for_childminders.pdf">guidelines
for childminders (pdf)</a> are available to childminders from their local City
or County Childcare Committee (CCC). In addition, there is a <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/childcare-relief.html">childminder’s
tax relief</a> for people who look after up to 3 children in their own home.
<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Drop-in centres</strong><br>
A drop-in centre offers a service for short periods during the day. These
centres are often provided in shopping centres, leisure centres and
accommodation facilities. The service is provided as part of a customer or
client service and children are looked after while the parent is availing of a
service or attending an event. </p>

<p><strong>School-age childcare</strong><br>
Services for schoolchildren can include breakfast clubs, after school clubs and
school holiday programmes such as summer camps. Depending on the service, there
may also be homework supervision, planned activities or a nutritious meal. </p>

<h2>Affordable childcare<br></h2>

<p><strong></strong>Affordable childcare is intended to provide childcare for
families on lower incomes, and also to support parents to return to work or
education. This type of service is called a community childcare
(not-for-profit) facility. For more information on affordable childcare
services in your area, contact your local City or County Childcare Committee -

Subvention (CCS) Programme</a> disadvantaged parents and parents in training,
education or low paid employment can avail of childcare at reduced rates. The
childcare is provided by community-based (not-for-profit) childcare services
who are participating in the CCS Programme. </p>

<p>From January 2017, children aged 0-5 years whose parents are homeless (and
those transitioning from homelessness to permanent accommodation) will be
offered free childcare for 25 hours a week under the CCS Programme.</p>

<p><strong>After-School Child Care Scheme:</strong> The <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_and_work/afterschool_childcare_scheme.html">After-School
Child Care Scheme (ASCC)</a> supports low-income unemployed people to return to
work. The scheme provides subsidised after-school childcare places to people
with children of primary school age who find employment, increase the number of
days they work or take up a place on an employment support scheme.</p>

<p><strong>Childcare Education and Training Support Programme (CETS)</strong>:
If you have applied for a vocational training course provided by an Education
and Training Board and you need childcare, you may qualify for a childcare at
reduced rates under the <a href="../vocational_education_and_training/child_care_support_during_fas_training_courses.html">CETS
Programme</a>. CETS can provide full-time, part-time or after-school childcare
places.</p>

<p><strong>Community Employment Childcare (CEC) Programme</strong>: The <a href="community_employment_childcare_programme.html">Community Employment
Childcare (CEC) Programme</a> provides childcare places at reduced rates for
Community Employment (CE) applicants who need childcare so that they can take
up a place on a CE scheme.</p>

<p><strong>Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme</strong></p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="early_childhood_care_and_education_scheme.html">Early Childhood Care and
Education (ECCE) Scheme</a> provides free childcare and early education to
children of pre-school age. </p>

<p><strong>Single Affordable Childcare Scheme</strong></p>

<p>From September 2017 a new <a href="http://affordablechildcare.ie/">Single
Affordable Childcare Scheme</a> will provide a targeted subsidy, based on
parental income, for children aged between 6 months and 15 years and a
universal subsidy, for all families, for children aged between 6 months and 3
years. The new single affordable childcare programme will be developed to
replace the existing Community Childcare Subvention, After-School Childcare
Scheme, Childcare Education and Training Support programme and Community
Employment Childcare programme.</p>

<p>The Scheme will be available to children attending a childcare provider

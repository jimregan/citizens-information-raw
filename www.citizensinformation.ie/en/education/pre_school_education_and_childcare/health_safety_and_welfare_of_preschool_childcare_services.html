<p>The law in Ireland provides for the regulation and inspection of pre-school
childcare services. Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0017/index.html">Child
Care Act 1991</a> as amended by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2013/act/40/enacted/en/html">Child and
Family Agency Act 2013</a> the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) is charged with
ensuring the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children attending
services. Pre-school children are defined by law as “children under 6 years
of age, who are not attending a national school or equivalent”. Pre-school
services include pre-schools, play groups, day nurseries, crèches,
childminders and other similar services looking after more than 3 pre-school
children. </p>

<h3>Inspection and notification<br></h3>

<p>Pre-school care providers are required to notify the Child and Family Agency
that they are providing services. In addition, they are required to take all
reasonable measures to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of pre-school
children attending their service. Specifics about the regulation of pre-school
childcare services are set out in the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/si/0604.html"></a><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/si/221/made/en/print">Child Care
Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016</a>. These Regulations set
down the standards of health, safety and welfare that must be in place before
such services can be provided. </p>

<p><br>
Overall, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=120">Department of Children and
Youth Affairs (DCYA)</a> has responsibility for these Regulations and for
developing policy in this area. The Child and Family Agency is required to
inspect and regulate pre-school childcare services and has published <a shape="rect" href="http://www.tusla.ie/services/preschool-services/tips-for-parents">a list
of tips on choosing a pre-school.</a></p>

<h3>What pre-school childcare services are covered? </h3>

<p>The different types of <a shape="rect" href="your_childcare_options.html">pre-school childcare services</a> are
described in the Regulations as follows:<br><strong>Sessional services<br></strong>Playgroups, crèches, Montessori groups, playschools, naionraí and
childminders looking after more than 3 children offer sessional pre-school
services. Services normally offered are planned programmes, consisting of up to
3.5 hours per session (for example, a morning or an afternoon). They generally
cater for pre-school children in the 3-5 year age bracket. </p>

<p><strong>Part-time day care</strong><br>
This offers a structured day care service for pre-school children for more than
3.5 hours and less than 5 hours per day.</p>

<p><strong>Full day care</strong><br>
This is a structured day care service for more than 5 hours per day. Providers
include day nurseries and crèches.</p>

<p><strong>Childminders</strong><br>
Childminders care for children in the childminder’s own home. Throughout the
year, they offer this service for the full working day or for different periods
during the day. Parents and childminders negotiate their own terms such as
hours, rates and duties. As part of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.omc.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2Fchildcare%2Fchildminders.htm&amp;mn=chiy&amp;nID=5">National
Childminding Initiative</a> the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has
published <a shape="rect" href="http://www.omc.gov.ie/documents/childcare/guidelines_for_childminders.pdf">guidelines
for childminders (pdf).</a> </p>

<p>A childminder can care for no more than 5 pre-school children ar any given
time, including the childminder's own pre-school children. Only childminders
caring for more than 3 children are covered by the Child Care Act, 1991. </p>

<p>A <strong>childminding tax relief</strong> applies to people who mind up to
3 children in the minder's own home. No tax is payable on their childminding
earnings provided the earnings are less than €15,000 per year. If the
earnings exceed this amount tax is payable on the full amount. Childminders
must include their childminding income in their annual tax return. They must
also notify their local City or County Childcare Committee that they are
providing a childminding service. </p>

<p><strong>Pre-school service in a drop-in centre</strong> <br>
A pre-school service in a drop-in centre refers to a service where a pre-school
child is cared for over a period of not more than 2 hours while the parent or
guardian is availing of a service or attending an event. Such services are
mainly located in places such as shopping centres or leisure centres.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Exemptions</h3>

<p>Certain pre-school care providers are exempt from notifying the Child and
Family Agency including:</p>
<ul><li>A relative of the child or the spouse of such a relative (that is, the
    brother, sister, aunt, uncle, grandparent or step-parent of the child) </li>
  <li>If you are caring for 1 or more pre-school children of the same family
    and no other children (other than your own) in your own home </li>
  <li>If you are caring for not more than 3 pre-school children from different
    families (other than your own) in your own home </li>
</ul><h3>Childcare Regulations <br></h3>

<p>Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016 are made under
Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991 and prescribe the measures which must be in
place to meet the requirements of the Act. Areas covered by the Regulations
include the following: </p>

<p><strong>Health, welfare and development of the child<br></strong>A person carrying on a pre-school service shall ensure that each
child’s learning, development and well-being is facilitated within the daily
life of the service through the provision of the appropriate interaction,
materials and equipment, having regard to the age and stage of development of
the child and appropriate suitable care practices. </p>

<p><strong>First aid and medical assistance</strong><br>
There should be a suitably equipped first-aid box for children and arrangements
to call medical assistance in an emergency. A person trained in first aid for
children must be available at all times.</p>

<p><strong>Management and staffing<br></strong>The law makes provision that a person carrying out a pre-school
service must ensure that a sufficient number of suitable and competent adults
are working directly with the children at all times. The DCYA has published a
<a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2Fchildcare%2Fqualifications.htm&amp;mn=chie&amp;nID=9">list
of recognised qualifications</a> for the purposes of the DCYA childcare
programmes.</p>

<p>There should be appropriate vetting of all staff, students and volunteers
who have access to a child by obtaining references and <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/monitoring_and_surveillance_at_work/garda_clearance_for_employees.html">Garda
vetting</a>. </p>

<p>*When a full day care service also takes children not on a full day basis,
sessional service adult numbers apply.</p>

<p>The Child and Family Agency can limit the maximum number of pre-school
children who may be catered for at the same time. This provision is aimed at
preventing over-crowding in pre-school services. If the Child and Family Agency
proposes to limit numbers, the provider will be notified and has the
opportunity to appeal or make representations about this decision. </p>

<p><strong>Behaviour management</strong><br>
Anyone providing a pre-school childcare service should ensure that no corporal
punishment is inflicted on any child attending the service. There should be
written policies and procedures to deal with and to manage a child’s
challenging behaviour and to assist the child to manage his or her
behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>Register of pre-school children<br></strong>A pre-school childcare provider should keep a register with details of
each child attending the service including name, date of birth, contact numbers
for parents and child’s doctors.</p>

<p><strong>Information for parents </strong><br>
Parents should be given information about the service including details of the
person in charge and other staff, the adult/child ratios, the age range of the
children, the type of care, facilities, opening hours and fees. </p>

<p><strong>Premises and facilities</strong> <br>
Pre-school services (including childminders, drop-in centres, crèches, etc.)
are obliged to ensure their standards meet certain standards and provide
certain facilities. These rules include ensuring that:</p>
<ul><li>The premises are of sound and stable structure and are suitable for
    providing pre-school services </li>
  <li>Adequate space per child is provided in the premises </li>
  <li>Fixtures, premises and fittings are kept in a proper state of repair and
    in a clean and hygienic condition </li>
  <li>There must be adequate and suitable furniture, play and work equipment
    and materials available on the premises of the pre-school service</li>
  <li>There are adequate and suitable facilities for a pre-school child to rest
    and to play indoors and outdoors during the day </li>
</ul><p>Pre-school childcare providers are required to ensure that the building has
suitable and adequate heating, ventilation and lighting and sanitary
facilities.</p>

<p><strong>Safety measures</strong> </p>

<p>All reasonable measures must be taken to safeguard the health, safety and
welfare of a pre-school child attending the service and ensure that the
environment of the service is safe.</p>

<p>Registered childcare providers must have a safety statement and a policies
on a number of areas including managing behaviour, the administration of
medication, infection control and safe sleep.</p>

<p><strong>Food and drink</strong><br>
A pre-school service should ensure that food is nutritious and complies with
dietary and religious requrements.</p>

<p>The Department of Health's <a href="http://health.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Food-and-Nutrition-Guidelines-for-Pre-School-Services.pdf">Food
and Nutrition Guidelines for Pre-School Services (pdf)</a> advise that children
in day care for more than 5 hours per session (full day care) should be offered
at least 2 snacks and 2 meals, including one hot meal. </p>

<p><strong>Insurance</strong><br>
The provider should ensure that the pre-school children are adequately insured
against injury while attending the service.</p>

<p>Early childhood education generally means education before the start of
formal schooling or before the age at which children are generally required to
attend school. It covers the period from birth to 6 years. Legislation on
school attendance requires children to be at school (or receiving an education)
from the age of 6. In practice, almost all 5-year-olds and about half of
4-year-olds actually attend primary schools. </p>

<p>Early childhood education services include infant classes in <a shape="rect" href="../primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_primary_school/">primary
schools</a> and a range of <a shape="rect" href="your_childcare_options.html">childcare and preschool services</a>.
Pre-school childcare services are <a shape="rect" href="health_safety_and_welfare_of_preschool_childcare_services.html">regulated
by Child and Family Agency</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="early_childhood_care_and_education_scheme.html">Early Childhood Care and
Education (ECCE) Scheme</a> provides early care and education for children of
pre-school age. In general, the provision amounts to 3 hours per day, 5 days a
week over certain number of weeks for children enrolled in participating
playschools. </p>

<p>The ECCE scheme is administered by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.omc.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=120"><u>Department of Children
and Youth Affairs</u></a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l18e04">Role of the Department of Education and
Skills in early education</h2>

<p>The involvement of the Department of Education and Skills in early childhood
education focuses mainly on interventions for children who are disadvantaged or
have special needs. The Early Years Education Policy Unit of the Department of
Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs work on
policy issues affecting early childhood care and education.</p>

<h3>Infant classes in primary school</h3>

<p>There is a special grant allocation to national schools to help buy
equipment and materials for infant classes in primary schools. </p>

<h3>Early Start </h3>

<p>The <a href="early_start.html">Early Start Programme</a> aims to tackle
educational disadvantage by targeting children who are at risk of not reaching
their potential within the education system. It is a one-year preventative
intervention scheme offered to pre-school children (3 to 4 years old) in some
schools in disadvantaged areas.</p>

<h3>Children under 4 with special needs </h3>

<p>Local Health Offices and/or voluntary bodies provide services for young
children with severe or profound disabilities. </p>

<p>Pre-school children do not have a specific right to education. However, they
are entitled to certain health services which are related to education. The
Health Service Executive is responsible for providing psychological services
and speech and language therapy services for pre-school children with
disabilities who are assessed as needing these services. <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/health_services_for_people_with_disabilities/assessment_of_need_for_people_with_disabilites.html">Assessments</a>
of children under the age of 5 are carried out under the assessment of need
provisions of the Disability Act 2005.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../primary_and_post_primary_educational_supports/visiting_teacher_service_for_children_with_visual_impairments_in_ireland.html">Visiting
Teacher Service</a> of the Department of Education and Skills provides a
service to young children with visual and/or hearing impairment, from the age
of 2 years. </p>

<p>There are a small number of special pre-school class units for children with
autistic spectrum disorders. These units are attached to primary schools.</p>

<p><strong>Budget 2016</strong></p>

<p>It was announced in Budget 2016 that a number of supports to enable children
with disabilities to fully participate in pre-school care and education will be
phased in during 2016. Supports will include grants for equipment, appliances,
minor alterations, access to therapeutic intervention and training for
childcare staff.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="laca1a">Government policy on early childhood
education</h2>

<p>The White Paper on Early Childhood Education 'Ready to Learn' is concerned
with children from birth to 6 years. It sets out the core objective of early
childhood education as 'supporting the development and educational achievement
of children through high quality early education, with particular focus on the
target groups of the disadvantaged and those with special needs'.<br>
It sets out a number of guiding principles:</p>
<ul><li>Quality will underpin all aspects of early education provision. </li>
  <li>The State will build on existing provision and use the existing
    regulatory framework, where possible. </li>
  <li>Implementation will be undertaken on a gradual, phased basis to allow all
    the participants in the system to prepare adequately for the challenges
    that lie ahead. </li>
  <li>Progress will be achieved through a process of consultation, dialogue and
    partnership. </li>
</ul><p>The White Paper proposes early support for families of children with special
needs; such parents should have access to an early education expert, initially
as an advisor to parents, then as a teacher. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.siolta.ie/">Síolta: the National Framework
for Quality in Early Childhood Education</a> was published in 2006. The Early
Years Education Policy Unit of the Department of Education and Skills manages
the implementation of Síolta. </p>

<p>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has developed <a href="http://www.ncca.ie/en/Curriculum_and_Assessment/Early_Childhood_and_Primary_Education/Early_Childhood_Education/">Aistear</a>:
the Early Childhood Curriculum Framework, for children from birth to 6 years of
age. This framework, published in 2009, describes the types of learning that
are important for children of this age group and sets out broad learning goals
for all children. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme provides early
childhood care and education for children of pre-school age. From September
2016, children are eligible for the ECCE scheme if they are aged over 3 years
and not older than 5 and a half years.</p>

<p>The State pays a capitation fee to participating playschools and daycare
services. In return, they provide a pre-school service free of charge to all
children within the qualifying age range for a set number of hours over a set
period of weeks (see ‘How the ECCE scheme is provided’ below).</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Eligible age range</h3>

<p>From September 2016, children will be able to start ECCE when they reach 3
years of age and continue until they transfer to primary school (provided that
they are not older than 5 years and 6 months at the end of the pre-school
year). This is an increase in the number of weeks than previously available on
the ECCE scheme. Children will be able to enroll in pre-school at 3 different
points (September, January and April) in the school year in order to access the
scheme. The school year is normally from September to June.</p>

<p>Childcare Committees Ireland provides an <a href="http://eccedisability.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Your-childs-eligibility-for-the-ECCE-programme.pdf">eligibility
calendar showing when your child can participate in the ECCE programme
(pdf)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Exemptions from age limit</strong></p>

<p>If your child is over the eligibility age requirement due to special needs
they may be able to get an exemption from the upper age limit for the ECCE
Scheme. </p>

<p>There are no exemptions to the lower age limit.</p>

<h3>How the ECCE scheme is provided</h3>

<p>The pattern of hours of free pre-school education depends on the type of
service that your child attends and the weekly pattern that the service
operates. The various types of service are described in <a shape="rect" href="your_childcare_options.html">our document on childcare options</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Sessional services</strong></p>

<p>If your child attends a half-day or “sessional” service, such as a
playschool, naíonra, Montessori or parent and toddler group, the normal
pattern for the free pre-school year is 3 hours a day, 5 days a week, over the
school year. If your child attends for more than 3 hours, you will be charged
for the extra time.</p>

<p>If your child’s sessional service cannot open for 5 days a week, the
normal pattern for the free pre-school year is 3 hours and 30 minutes a day, 4
days a week, over the school year. This only applies to services which have
already been granted permission to run their service over the school year.</p>

<p><strong>Daycare services</strong></p>

<p>If your child attends a full-time or part-time daycare service, the normal
pattern for the free pre-school year is 3 hours per day over the school year.
If your child attends for longer than this each day, you will be charged for
the extra time. You will also be charged for the extra number of weeks
attended</p>

<h3>Content and quality of service</h3>

<p>Childcare services taking part in the ECCE scheme must provide an
appropriate pre-school educational programme which adheres to the principles of
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.siolta.ie/">Síolta</a>, the national
framework for early years care and education. Síolta co-ordinators and staff
of the local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) will support participating
services with assistive visits and advice.</p>

<p>There is <a href="https://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2FECCE-Scheme%2Fintro.htm&amp;mn=chil3g&amp;nID=3">further
information on the ECCE scheme</a> on the website of the Department of Children
and Youth Affairs.</p>

<h3>Children with special needs</h3>

<p>A new <strong>Access and Inclusion Model (AIM)</strong> was introduced on
the 15 June 2016 for children starting ECCE in September 2016. AIM supports a
child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from
universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the pre-school
provider. The model will offer tailored, practical supports based on need.</p>

<p>Levels 1 – 3 of the model involve a suite of universal supports which are
designed to promote and support an inclusive culture within pre-school settings
by means of educational and capacity-building initiatives for providers and
practitioners. Where a pre-school service provider, in partnership with a
parent, considers that some further additional support may be necessary to meet
the needs of a particular child, they can apply for one or more additional
targeted supports under levels 4 – 7 of the model.</p>

<p>Additional targeted supports could take the form of expert early childhood
care and educational advice and mentoring (level 4), specialised equipment,
appliances and minor alterations (level 5), therapeutic supports (level 6) or
additional capitation to fund extra assistance in the ECCE pre-school room
(level 7).</p>

<p>When you have identified a pre-school for your child, your service provider,
in consultation with you, will consider what supports may be needed to ensure
your child’s participation in pre-school.</p>

<p>Where it is considered that your child needs additional support, your
pre-school service provider can apply, in partnership with you, for targeted
supports under AIM.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.preschoolaccess.ie/">AIM website</a> provides <a href="http://www.preschoolaccess.ie/for-parents/">information for Parents</a>
and <a href="http://www.preschoolaccess.ie/faqs/">Frequently Asked
Questions</a> on supports available. Your local City or County Childcare
Committee will also be able to provide you with information and guidance on
AIM.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>There is no charge to parents for the playschool or daycare hours provided
under the ECCE scheme. The State capitation fee pays the playschool or daycare
service to provide these ECCE hours. However, if your child attends for extra
hours, you will have to pay for these extra hours in the normal way.</p>

<p>A service may charge parents for extra activities. However, these must be
optional and the service must provide other appropriate activities to children
who don’t take part in the optional activity being charged for.</p>

<p><strong>Booking deposits</strong></p>

<p>The service may ask you for a booking deposit, which cannot be more than
four times the weekly capitation fee (see below). Any deposit you pay must be
repaid to you by the end of October of the year your child starts. </p>

<p><strong>Capitation rates for service providers</strong></p>

<p>For providers of daycare and sessional services, the weekly capitation fee
is provided over the school year. Daycare and sessional playschools with more
highly qualified staff may be able to qualify for a higher capitation fee. </p>

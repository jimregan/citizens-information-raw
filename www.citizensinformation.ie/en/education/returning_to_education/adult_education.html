<p>Adult education courses are designed so that you can return to education in
flexible ways. They take account of your particular needs and circumstances as
an adult. There are part-time and full-time courses available. A number of
organisations provide specialist <a href="sources_of_information_on_returning_to_education.html">help and advice
about returning to education</a>.</p>

<p>You don't need formal qualifications in order to take part in many full-time
and part-time courses that are on offer. Many courses are provided through your
local <a href="http://www.etbi.ie/etbs/directory-of-etbs/">Education and
Training Board</a>. These include <a shape="rect" href="adult_literacy.html">adult literacy</a> programmes and courses for early
school-leavers, opportunities to return to study for <a shape="rect" href="../primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_post_primary_school/senior_cycle.html">the
Leaving Certificate</a> or other certificates and a wide range of vocational
training linked to business and industry.</p>

<p>Some courses are generally only open to you if you have completed your
secondary education. These include <a href="../vocational_education_and_training/training_and_apprentiship_programmes/post_leaving_certificate_courses.html">Post-Leaving
Certificate Courses</a> and college-based training courses for apprentices, as
well as full-time and part-time <a href="../third_level_education/applying_to_college/third_level_courses_for_mature_students.html">third-level
courses</a>. However, you should check the entry requirements with the school
or college as some courses make exceptions for mature students.</p>

<p>There are a number of <a href="../vocational_education_and_training/training_and_apprentiship_programmes/continuing_education_and_training.html">education
and training schemes and supports</a> available that can support you to return
to education and training.</p>

<p><strong>Education and Training Boards</strong></p>

<p>Since 1 July 2013, Education and Training Boards (ETBs) replaced Vocational
Educational Committees (VECs). All services provided by VECs will continue to
be provided by ETBs. </p>

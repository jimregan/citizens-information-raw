<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Back To Education Initiative (BTEI) provides part-time further education
courses mainly for people with less than upper second-level education.</p>

<p>It gives individuals the opportunity to combine learning with family, work
and other responsibilities. Anyone who has left full-time education can take
part in a course, but priority will be given to those with less than upper
second-level education.</p>

<p>BTEI courses are usually level 3 and 4 on the <a href="http://www.nfq.ie/nfq/en/FanDiagram/nqai_nfq_08.html">National
Qualification Framework (NFQ)</a>. The BTEI allows people to study part-time
(up to 400 hours per year). It is possible to obtain a major award at NFQ
levels 1-6 where part-time courses are undertaken on a modular basis over time
and combined to complete a major award.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The Back to Education Initiative (BTEI) provides part-time courses for
adults and young people aged over 16 who left school with few or no formal
qualifications or low literacy levels.</p>

<p>The groups prioritised for participation in the BTEI are listed in the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/Further-Education-and-Training/Back-to-Education-Initiative-BTEI-/Back-To-Education-Initiative-Operational-Guidelines.pdf">Back
to Education Initiative Operational Guidelines (pdf)</a>. Within these groups,
priority is given to those most educationally disadvantaged.</p>

<p>You can also take part in BTEI if you are working and on a low income. The
aim is to give people an opportunity to combine their learning with family,
work and other commitments.</p>

<p>The participants eligible for free tuition are people who (or their
dependants):</p>
<ul><li>Have less than upper-second level education or</li>
  <li>Are getting a jobseeker’s payment or means-tested social welfare
    payment (there is a list of eligible payments in the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/Further-Education-and-Training/Back-to-Education-Initiative-BTEI-/Back-To-Education-Initiative-Operational-Guidelines.pdf">BTEI
    Operational Guidelines (pdf)</a>) or</li>
  <li>Are getting <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
    Income Supplement</a> or</li>
  <li>Have a <a href="../../health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical
    card</a> or</li>
  <li>Are eligible to participate on <a href="vocational_training_opportunities_scheme.html">VTOS</a> or <a href="../vocational_education_and_training/youthreach.html">Youthreach</a></li>
</ul><p>All other participants are charged a fee. For information about fees, you

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>In general, a training allowance is not paid, but a pro-rata training
allowance may be paid to a participant that has no entitlement to a social
welfare payment but is eligible for Youthreach.</p>

<p>If you are getting a social welfare payment, you may keep your payment and
participate in BTEI as long as you continue to satisfy the conditions attached
to your payment. If you are getting a jobseeker’s payment you will need to
apply for the <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/back_to_education/part_time_education_option.html">Part-Time
Education Option</a>.</p>

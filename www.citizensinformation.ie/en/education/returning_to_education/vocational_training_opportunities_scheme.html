<p>If you are over 21 years of age, unemployed and have been getting certain
social welfare payments for at least 6 months you can apply for the Vocational
Training and Opportunities Scheme (VTOS). The VTOS scheme provides a range of
courses to meet the education and training needs of unemployed people. It gives
participants opportunities to improve their general level of education, gain
certification, develop their skills and prepare for employment, self-employment
and further education and training. VTOS is operated through local <a href="http://www.etbi.ie/etbs/directory-of-etbs/">Education and Training
Boards</a> and is aimed in particular at unemployed people who are early
school-leavers.</p>

<p><strong>Education and Training Boards</strong></p>

<p>Since 1 July 2013, Education and Training Boards (ETBs) replaced Vocational
Educational Committees (VECs). All services provided by VECs will continue to
be provided by ETBs. </p>

<h3>What kinds of courses are available?</h3>

<p>The courses range from basic education and training to advanced vocational
training and there is a wide choice of subjects. The courses are full-time,
about 30 hours a week (for example, 6 hours a day for 5 days) and can last up
to 2 years. Many courses lead to qualifications such as the Junior Certificate,
Leaving Certificate and awards at Levels 3, 4, 5 and 6 on the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nfq.ie/nfq/en/index.html">National Framework of
Qualifications.</a> You can find a list of <a shape="rect" href="http://www.qualifax.ie/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;view=wrapper&amp;Itemid=15&amp;Mainsec=courses&amp;Subsec=search_courses&amp;CRAsort=&amp;action=search&amp;display=&amp;CSH_ID=18&amp;PREV_CSH_ID=&amp;AdvancedKeyword=&amp;keywords_and_titles=&amp;all_or_any_words=&amp;full_or_part_words=&amp;FCT_ID=&amp;FDM_ID=&amp;keywords=&amp;CRT_ID=25&amp;QUA_ID=0&amp;CTP_ID=0&amp;COL_ID=0&amp;RES_ID=0&amp;points=&amp;CRS_CODE=&amp;CRA_ID=0&amp;ATT_ID=0&amp;PRV_ID=0&amp;COU_ID=0&amp;DST_ID=0">VTOS

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<h3>Jobseeker's payments</h3>

<p>If you started VTOS before January 2013 and you are getting Jobseeker’s
Allowance or Jobseeker’s Benefit, you will get a training allowance at a rate
equivalent to the maximum rate of Jobseeker’s Benefit instead of your
jobseeker's payment. </p>

<p>From January 2013, VTOS participants who move from jobseeker's payments will
no longer have their new payments increased to the maximum €188 per week, in
cases where their jobseeker's payment is less than this. However, people
<strong>under 25</strong> will continue to receive a top-up rate of up to
€160 per week (any means you have will be deducted from this rate). This will
apply to new participants only. </p>

<p><strong></strong>Since January 2014, VTOS participants <strong>under
26</strong> who move from an age-related reduced rate of Jobseeker’s
Allowance will get a top-up rate of €160 per week - this will apply to new
participants only.</p>

<p>Generally, your entitlement to a VTOS training allowance will not be
reassessed if there is a change to your circumstances (including means). </p>

<p><strong>VTOS training allowance and work:</strong> If you are returning to
your course for a second year, you will continue to get your VTOS allowance
during the summer months. You can also take up full-time work during the summer
months and your VTOS payment is not affected. </p>

<p><strong>VTOS training allowance and dependants:</strong> If you want a
dependant adult or child added to your payment you must notify the Department
of Social Protection (DSP). DSP will then notify the ETB of any changes to your
VTOS training allowance.</p>

<h3>Other social welfare payments</h3>

<p>If you are getting one of the other eligible social welfare payments you
will continue to get your payment in the normal way. You must continue to meet
the conditions of your payment. If you are on a reduced means-tested payment it
will be increased to the maximum amount for your situation while you are
participating on VTOS. You will also continue to get your social welfare
secondary benefits. </p>

<h3>Other supports</h3>

<p>Since 2010, people on PLC courses who are getting VTOS allowances are no
longer eligible for student support grants. However, this does not affect any
entitlement they may have to exemption from college fees or student
contributions. </p>

<p>There are no fees for VTOS courses and you will get free books and materials
at the start of the course. Depending on your individual circumstances you may
be eligible for the following: </p>
<ul><li>Meal allowance </li>
  <li>Travel allowance </li>
  <li>Free childcare place for your child under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.fas.ie/en/About+Us/News/20th+August+2010.htm">Childcare
    Employment and Training Support (CETS)</a> scheme, </li>
  <li>A training bonus payment, if you have been getting an eligible social
    welfare payment for at least 12 months before starting the VTOS scheme.
    <strong>It was announced in Budget 2014</strong>, from 1 January 2014, the
    €20 bonus payment to long-term unemployed VTOS participants will end.
    This only applies to new participants.</li>
</ul><p>More detailed <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Vocational-Training-Opportunities-Scheme.aspx">information
about VTOS</a> is available on the Department of Social Protection's
website.</p>

<p>VTOS training allowances are not taxable.</p>

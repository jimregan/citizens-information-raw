<p>A significant proportion of the Irish population has low levels of literacy.
This means that tasks like filling in forms, helping their children with their
homework or reading the instructions on a medicine bottle are difficult for a
large number of people. The Education and Training Board (ETB) runs an adult
literacy service which allows people with reading and writing difficulties to
gain access to literacy education. The Adult Literacy Organiser (ALO) of the
<acronym title="Vocational Educational Committee">ETB</acronym> is responsible
for managing the delivery of the adult literacy service. </p>

<p>The <acronym title="Vocational Educational Committee">ETB</acronym> adult
literacy service involves literacy tutors providing tuition to adult students.
</p>

<p>In addition, the radio and television projects of <a href="http://www.nala.ie/what-we-do/improve-literacy/distance-education">NALA's
Distance Education Service</a> and the website <a href="http://www.literacytools.ie/">Literacytools.ie</a> can be used by people
in their own homes. </p>

<p><strong>Education and Training Boards</strong></p>

<p>Since 1 July 2013, Education and Training Boards (ETBs) replaced Vocational
Educational Committees (VECs). All services provided by VECs will continue to
be provided by ETBs. F√ÅS training centres will also transfer to ETBs.</p>

<h3>If you wish to improve your reading, writing and maths skills</h3>

<p>Learners and tutors interact on an equal basis in the <acronym title="Vocational Educational Committee">ETB</acronym> adult literacy service
and classes focus on the needs of the learner as an individual.</p>

<p>The people who attend the <acronym title="Vocational Educational Committee">ETB</acronym> adult literacy service
come from all walks of life and have different reasons for wanting to improve
their reading, writing, spelling and maths, whether it be self-improvement, job
advancement or just to helping their children with their homework. </p>

<p>You do not need to have reached a certain standard of education (for
example, the Junior or Leaving Certificate) to join. You can use the service
for as long as you wish and it is also possible to take a break and rejoin it
at a later stage. </p>

<p>Everyone has his or her own trained literacy tutor and, before you start
your first class, you will decide together what you would like to cover. Your
tutor will then plan each class to suit you. There is no set course and classes
are usually around two hours long per week. </p>

<p>It is important to remember that there are people of every age and from
every background with low levels of literacy. You have no need to feel
embarrassed or anxious and your attendance is confidential. All tutors are
specially trained to help you feel at ease and get the most out of your
classes. </p>

<p>When you contact the adult literacy service in your local ETB, the person in
charge of your local service will invite you to call in to discuss the service
and your needs. There is no test or right or wrong answers to questions. After
this meeting, the organiser will arrange for a tutor to work with you. </p>

<p>Students and tutors work closely together so it is important that you get on
well together. If you are not happy with your tutor, you can talk in confidence
to the person in charge of your local service, usually the Adult Literacy
Organiser. </p>

<h3>If you wish to become an adult literacy tutor</h3>

<p>You do not need specific educational qualifications or to have worked as a
teacher to become an adult literacy tutor as you will be given full training.
All that is required of you is a genuine desire to work with adults who have
literacy difficulties. If you can read, are a good communicator and are
confident in your ability to understand adults with literacy difficulties, then
you can help. </p>

<p>If you wish to become a tutor in a <acronym title="Vocational Educational Committee">ETB </acronym>adult literacy service,
you should contact your local <acronym title="Vocational Educational Committee">ETB</acronym> Adult Literacy Organiser
for details of initial training courses in your area. You can contact the
organiser by phoning your local <acronym title="Vocational Educational Committee">ETB</acronym> office or <acronym title="National Adult Literacy Agency">National Adult Literacy</acronym>
Association (NALA).</p>

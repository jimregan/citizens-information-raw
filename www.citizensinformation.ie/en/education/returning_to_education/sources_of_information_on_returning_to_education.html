<p>Many people including <a shape="rect" href="../vocational_education_and_training/training_and_apprentiship_programmes/early_school_leavers_programmes.html">early
school leavers</a>, unemployed people and those who want to retrain for a new
job may be interested in returning to education on a full-time or part-time
basis. If you are interested in returning to education, there are a number of
organisations and resources where you can get information about the courses
available to you. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.etbi.ie/etbs">Education and Training Boards (ETBs)</a>
are the main providers of <a shape="rect" href="../adult_and_life_long_education/adult_education.html">adult
education</a>, through local schools and colleges. (Vocational Educational
Committees (VECs) were replaced by Education and Training Boards (ETBs) on 1
July 2013.) <a href="../adult_and_life_long_education/community_education.html">Community
education groups</a> offer a variety of courses, catering for learners at all
levels. <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Learners/Information/Providers-of-Higher-Education/List.html">Third-level
colleges</a> provide a wide range of courses too. </p>

<p>In 2014, the FÁS training division (including FÁS courses) transferred to
the 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) which replaced VECs. </p>

<p>Whether you are looking for a sociable way to learn a language or whether
you are looking to gain a particular formal qualification, the range of evening
classes available throughout Ireland should provide you with what you need. </p>

<p>Evening classes take place during term time in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.etbi.ie/etbs/directory-of-etbs/">Education and Training Boards
(ETBs)</a>, <a href="http://findaddress.citizensinformation.ie/service_finder/">schools</a>,
<a href="http://findaddress.citizensinformation.ie/service_finder/">colleges</a>
and universities throughout the country. The courses on offer vary from centre
to centre so it is worth looking around if you have a particular interest you
would like to pursue. </p>

<p>In general you need to enrol a few weeks before the course starts. Enrolment
takes place around mid September, again in mid-January and, in those centres
with a summer term, around mid-March. </p>

<p>Normally, evening classes are advertised locally - for example in your local
newspaper, community centre, health centre, school, parish hall, etc. Your
local ETB, college and secondary school will also be able to give you details
on the courses that are on in your area and when they begin.</p>

<p><strong>Education and Training Boards</strong></p>

<p>Since 1 July 2013, Education and Training Boards (ETBs) replaced Vocational
Educational Committees (VECs). All services provided by VECs will continue to
be provided by ETBs. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The majority of evening classes are unaccredited and, as a result, you will
not need any formal qualifications to take part. However, if you are interested
in a course that offers a particular qualification, you may be required to have
some prior qualification or experience in order to be eligible. Get in touch
with the course organisers in advance, to check if there are any academic or
professional qualifications required for your course. </p>

<p>The only requirement for most evening classes is that you pay the fee in
advance.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Evening classes are generally self-funding so the cost of your course will
relate directly to the cost of the materials you will need. As a result, costs
may differ greatly from course to course. <br></p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>The ETB usually organises a registration evening where you go along in
person, sign up and pay for the course in advance. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.etbi.ie/etbs/directory-of-etbs/">Contact information for all

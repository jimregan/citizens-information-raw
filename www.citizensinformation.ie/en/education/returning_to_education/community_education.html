<p>Community education refers to adult education and learning, generally
outside the formal education sector, which aims to enhance learning, empower
people and contribute to society. It promotes personalised learning and
flexibility within the learning group. Participants are involved as equal
partners in identifying needs, designing and implementing programmes, and
adapting them on an ongoing basis.</p>

<p>The goals of the community education sector include not just individual
development but also community advancement, especially in marginalised
communities. </p>

<p>A key feature of community education programmes is that they provide the
supports necessary for successful access and learning, particularly guidance,
mentoring, continuous feedback and childcare.</p>

<h3>Community Education Facilitators<br></h3>

<p>Community Education Facilitators work within the Education and Training
Boards (ETBs) to give support to local community groups. This includes giving
technical/administrative help, supporting the development, maintenance, and
co-ordination of community education groups and strengthening links between the
formal and non-formal education sectors. They assist and support the
development of new community-based educational initiatives. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.cefa.ie/">Community Education Facilitators Association</a>
(CEFA) is their professional organisation.</p>

<h3>Back to Education Initiative<br></h3>

<p>The <a href="back_to_education_initiative.html">Back to Education
Initiative (BTEI)</a> provides opportunities for second-chance education to
adult learners and early school-leavers who want to upgrade their skills. The
initiative allows learners to combine education with family, caring or work
responsibilities.  </p>

<h3>Role of ETBs in community education<br></h3>

<p>The Community Education Services operate within the ETBs and give support
services to community groups who are interested in community education as
follows: </p>
<ul><li>Community Education Facilitators provide assistance and support to new or
    existing community education groups. They provide information on sources of
    funding and help community education interests to access funding. </li>
  <li>Assistance is also available for community education groups to develop
    their own educational programmes and courses. This backup may include
    technical, administrative or educational input. </li>
  <li>They also facilitate networking with other groups and organisations with
    an interest in community education, and sharing good practice from other
    sectors. </li>
</ul><p><strong>Education and Training Boards</strong></p>

<p>Since 1 July 2013, Education and Training Boards (ETBs) replaced Vocational
Educational Committees (VECs). All services provided by VECs will continue to
be provided by ETBs. </p>

<h3>Accreditation and qualifications</h3>

<p>Community education courses generally use a combination of assessment
methods such as assignments, projects, learnersâ€™ records, observations,
skills demonstration and examinations. Accreditation has always posed
challenges to non-formal education providers as it is not always a goal or a
necessary outcome for all learners. However, the validity of learning in both
the formal and non-formal environment has been recognised and worked into the
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.nfq.ie/nfq/en/index.html">National Framework
of Qualifications</a> - a single system against which all learning can be
mapped. It allows for learners to move from non-formal into formal education,
from basic to further education, and from further into higher education in a
relatively straightforward way.</p>

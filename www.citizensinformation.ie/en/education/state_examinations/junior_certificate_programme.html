<p>The Junior Certificate examination is held at the end of the <a shape="rect" href="../primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_post_primary_school/junior_cycle.html">Junior
Cycle</a> in post-primary schools. The Junior Cycle caters for students aged
from 12 to 15 years and students normally sit the exam at the age of 14 or 15,
after 3 years of post-primary education. However, the Junior Certificate is not
limited to post-primary school students. </p>

<p>A candidate following an approved course of study outside the State or who
is attending an approved course of study organised under the <a shape="rect" href="../returning_to_education/vocational_training_opportunities_scheme.html">Vocational
Training Opportunities Scheme,</a> <a shape="rect" href="../adult_and_life_long_education/adult_literacy.html">adult literacy</a>
and <a shape="rect" href="../adult_and_life_long_education/community_education.html">community

the exams. <a shape="rect" href="../vocational_education_and_training/training_and_apprentiship_programmes/continuing_education_and_training.html">There

<p><strong>Changes to the Junior Cycle</strong></p>

<p>The Junior Certificate will be replaced with the <a href="http://www.curriculumonline.ie/Junior-cycle/Junior-Cycle-is-changing">Junior
Cycle Student Award (JCSA)</a>. There will be a school-work component to the
assessment which will be based on work completed by the student during second
and third year. </p>

<p>Students in second year will sit standardised tests in Maths and English
reading (or Irish reading in Irish-medium schools). Standardised testing in
Science will also be included. The <a href="http://www.ncca.ie/en/Curriculum_and_Assessment/Post-Primary_Education/Junior_Cycle/">National
Council for Curriculum and Assessment</a> is developing a new report card for
parents which will give them much more information about their son or
daughter’s learning progress. More information about the changes to the
Junior Cycle is available on the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Press-Events/Press-Releases/2015-Press-Releases/PR-%202015-%2005-%2022.html">Department
of Education’s website</a>.</p>

<h3>Assessment and examinations</h3>

<p>The Junior Certificate is assessed by means of a written examination at the
end of the three-year programme, along with practical examinations and project
work in some subjects and oral and aural examinations in Irish and continental
languages.</p>

<p>The practical and oral examinations take place during the third year of the
programme. The written examination takes place in June. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Students sitting for the Junior Certificate must pay an examination fee. In
early February of the exam year, the school sends parents who are paying the
examination fee a form. The parent makes the payment through a bank and the
bank must stamp the form. The parent then returns the form to the school.</p>

<p>Students whose parent or guardian holds a current <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical
card</a> do not have to pay the fee. In the case of parents who have a current
medical card, details of the medical card are put on the form and the parent
then sends the form back to the school.</p>

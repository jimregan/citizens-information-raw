<p>Most <a shape="rect" href="../primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_post_primary_school/senior_cycle.html">Senior
Cycle</a> students choose the established Leaving Certificate programme. This
2-year programme covers a wide range of subjects. </p>

<p>Subjects are normally studied at either Ordinary or Higher Level. Two
subjects, Irish and Mathematics, can be studied at Foundation Level. Foundation
Level is geared to the needs of students who might have difficulty with those
subjects at Ordinary or Higher Level. </p>

<p>Students normally study 6 or 7 subjects during the Senior Cycle. If they are
following the established Leaving Certificate programme they must take at least
5 subjects, including Irish.</p>

<p>In choosing Leaving Certificate subjects, students should take note of
subjects that they may need for the third-level courses of their choice. For
example, a student who hopes to get a place on a course at one of the
universities that make up the National University of Ireland must meet a
minimum entry requirement of 6 subjects, including English, Irish and a third
language, 2 of which must be at Grade C on a Higher Level paper.</p>

<p>The school guidance counsellor will have the information about the subject
requirements for each third-level course. The legal school-leaving age is 16
years.</p>

<h3>Leaving Certificate subjects</h3>

<p>The Department of Education and Skills publishes <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/Curriculum-and-Syllabus/">syllabus
and curriculum information</a>. The <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/The-Department/Agencies/National-Council-for-Curriculum-and-Assessment-NCCA-.html">National
Council for Curriculum and Assessment</a> provides a <a href="http://www.curriculumonline.ie/Senior-cycle/Curriculum">list of Leaving
Certificate subjects</a>.</p>

<p>Leaving Certificate students may take the <a shape="rect" href="junior_certificate_programme.html">Junior Certificate</a> programme in
French, German, Spanish or Italian as part of their approved Senior Cycle
course, if their schools offer this option. </p>

<h3>Assessment and examinations</h3>

<p>The established Leaving Certificate is assessed through a written
examination at the end of the 2-year programme. There are practical
examinations and project work in certain subjects, such as Art, Construction
Studies and Engineering. There are oral examinations in Irish and continental
languages. The practical and oral tests take place during the final year of the
programme. The written examination is held in June each year.</p>

<h3>Marking system for examination grades</h3>

<p>There is a new grading scheme for the Leaving Certificate in 2017. The new
scale has 8 grades, the highest grade is Grade 1 and the lowest grade is Grade
8.</p>

<p>The new 8-point grading scale replaces the 14-point scale at both Higher and
Ordinary levels. </p>

<p>Marks between 100% to 30% are divided into seven grade bands (1-7). Each
band is 10% wide.</p>

<p>The new scheme means that the Common Points Scale used by the CAO to
determine entry into higher education institutions, has also been revised. <a href="http://www.transition.ie/">You can read more on transition.ie.</a></p>

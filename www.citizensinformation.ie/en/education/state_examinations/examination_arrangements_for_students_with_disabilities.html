<p>Secondary school students with special needs may have special arrangements
made for them while sitting State examinations such as the Leaving Certificate
and Junior Certificate. Candidates with disabilities (for example, visual
impairments, motor and mobility impairments, etc.) can apply through their
school for reasonable accommodations during examinations. </p>

<p>Reasonable accommodations are designed to remove, as far as possible, the
impact of a disability on a candidate's performance and enable the candidate to
demonstrate his or her level of attainment in an examination setting. It does
not give the candidate an unfair advantage over other candidates in the same
examination. </p>

<h3>What 'reasonable accommodations' are available? </h3>

<p>Examples of reasonable accommodations include the following: </p>
<ul><li>The provision of enlarged and/or Braille versions of questions for
    visually impaired students </li>
  <li>You may use voice-activated computers, tape recorders or scribes (other
    people to do the writing) </li>
  <li>You may do your examination in a hospital or in any other stand-alone
    centre </li>
  <li>If you are deaf or hard of hearing, you may be exempted from the aural
    part of the examination </li>
</ul><h3>Accommodations that can be approved by your school</h3>

<p>Your school has the authority to make special provisions for students with
special needs during State exams on the basis of what is best for you. Some of
the special provisions your school can make include: </p>
<ul><li>Taking medicine, food or drinks into the examination centre where this is
    required for medical reasons. </li>
  <li>Use of a special desk or chair that is used in your classroom </li>
  <li>Use of low-vision aids that you normally use in the classroom </li>
  <li>Ensuring that deaf and hard-of-hearing students are seated close to the
    examination superintendent </li>
  <li>Granting breaks or rest periods in each examination session warranted by
    your physical or medical condition. (Under this special provision, the time
    taken for rest or as a break can be compensated for at the end of each
    examination period to a maximum of 20 minutes.) </li>
</ul><p>If you are not satisfied with the arrangements made, you may appeal to an
independent appeals forum. The members of the forum are from outside the
Commission and all appeals are considered in light of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.examinations.ie/index.php?l=en&amp;mc=ca&amp;sc=rc">Framework
of Principles</a> set out by the Expert Advisory Group on State
Examinations.</p>

<p>The State Examinations Commission has responsibility for ensuring the proper
conduct of State examinations in Ireland. The Commission has a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.examinations.ie/index.php?l=en&amp;mc=ca&amp;sc=ra">stated
policy regarding the issue of reasonable accommodations of students</a> with
special needs during examination time. </p>

<p>However, schools also have the authority to make a number of specified
arrangements to facilitate examination candidates with special needs without
requesting advance permission from the Commission. </p>

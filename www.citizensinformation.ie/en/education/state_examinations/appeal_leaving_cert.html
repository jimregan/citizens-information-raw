<p>Students who are not satisfied with the marks they got in one or more of
their Leaving Certificate results can appeal those results to the <a shape="rect" href="the_state_examinations_commission.html">State Examinations
Commission</a>. Before you make the decision to appeal your result(s), you may
view your examination script and then make your decision. </p>

<h3>Viewing your examination papers</h3>

<p>When you receive your exam results, your school will also have a
personalised application form that shows your details, including your subjects.
If you decide you would like to view a particular paper, you mark the form
accordingly. You must return the completed form to view your exam papers to
your school by a specified date. The Organising Superintendent appointed by the
State Examinations Commission will assign you to one of the viewing sessions.
You can find <a shape="rect" href="http://www.examinations.ie/index.php?l=en&amp;mc=ca&amp;sc=gv">information
about viewing marked examination papers</a> on the State Examinations
Commission website.</p>

<p>The results of oral examinations or the marks for practical examinations
cannot be viewed. Only the scripts from the written examinations can be viewed.
</p>

<h3>Appealing your results</h3>

<p>The State Examinations Commission will provide your school with a
personalised appeal application form. (For external candidates, this form will
be enclosed with your examination results.) You indicate the subjects you wish
to appeal on the appeal form. A result may be upgraded or downgraded as a
result of an appeal. </p>

<p>Your application to appeal your 2016 examination results <span>must be
received by 7 September 2016</span>.</p>

<h3>Appeal process</h3>

<p>Your script will be sent to an appeal examiner for re-marking. This examiner
will be different from the examiner who originally marked your work. The same
marking scheme is used for re-marking. This means that appeal examiners apply
the same standards in re-marking as were applied to all candidates in the
original examination. There is further information about the <a shape="rect" href="https://www.examinations.ie/index.php?l=en&amp;mc=ca&amp;sc=gl">appeal
process on the website of the State Examinations Commission.</a> </p>

<p>If you are not happy with the outcome of your appeal, you may request an <a shape="rect" href="http://www.examinations.ie/index.php?l=en&amp;mc=ca&amp;sc=gu">appeal
review by the Independent Appeals Scrutineers.</a> Application forms for an
appeal review are provided with your appeal results.</p>

<h3>Rectification outside of the appeal process</h3>

<p>If you have viewed your script and believe there is a clear discrepancy
between the mark awarded and the subsequent grade awarded, you also have means
of redress. You should ask the Organising Superintendent at the viewing session
for a Form AP1 and complete in accordance with the instructions. (You should
note that this facility applies only where it's clear that the total mark is
inconsistent with the grade awarded and where this matter can be resolved
administratively). <a shape="rect" href="http://www.examinations.ie/index.php?l=en&amp;mc=ca&amp;sc=ga">Information
on appealing your results and rectification outside of the appeal process is
available on the State Examinations Commission's website</a>. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>One person may accompany the student when he/she is looking at the script.
The student cannot arrange for someone else to look at a script in his/her
place. </p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The appeal fee is €40 <span>per subject</span> for the <a shape="rect" href="established_leaving_certificate.html">Established Leaving Certificate</a>
and must be paid in advance. The appeal fee for the <a shape="rect" href="leaving_certificate_applied.html">Applied Leaving Certificate</a> is
€15.50 per subject. This fee is returned to you if the result is upgraded.
Refunds will be made through your school, if you are entered for the exam by
your school. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>The student fills in the personalised appeal application form. </p>

<p>The student brings this form to a bank and pays the appeal fee using the
bank giro facility on that form. There is a unique reference number on the bank
giro form so this form must be used and <span>not the bank's own bank giro
form</span>. </p>

<p>(Using the bank's own giro form may delay or totally invalidate your appeal
because it could prove very difficult to subsequently prove you paid the
appropriate fee.) The bank must stamp the form. The student must bring the form
back to the school. </p>

<p>You can also <a href="https://www.examinations.ie/index.php?l=en&amp;mc=ex&amp;sc=er">pay your
appeal fee online</a>. You must then provide a printed copy of this e-mail
confirmation to the Organising Superintendent at the school/centre where you
sat your examination, along with your completed appeal application form. </p>

<p>The school/centre will associate your completed appeal application and
evidence of payment with the relevant examination script(s) and send them to
the State Examinations Commission.</p>

<p>The closing date for receipt of appeals by the State Examinations Commission
for 2016 is Wednesday 7 September 2016. This means your school will have to
post your application on Tuesday 6 September so you need to have paid the fee
and returned the form to your school on Monday 5 September or early on 6
September. </p>

<p>Students who are taking or repeating the Leaving Certificate must pay
examination fees in order to sit the exams. If you or your parent(s) or
guardian(s) hold a medical card, you are exempt from these fees. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you are taking the Leaving Certificate in a school setting, your school
will give you a form. You make the payment through a bank and the bank must
stamp the form. You then return the form to the school. </p>

<p>If you, your parent(s) or guardian(s) hold a current <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical
card</a> you do not have to pay the fee. Put the details of the medical card on
the fee payment form and return the form to the school.</p>

<p><strong>External students</strong></p>

<p>If you are an external student (that is, you are sitting your examinations
outside of a school setting), you can either <a href="https://www.examinations.ie/index.php?l=en&amp;mc=ca&amp;sc=ca">apply and
pay online</a> or get a form from the Entries section of the State Examinations
Commission (see 'Where to apply') and pay through a bank. </p>

<p>For external students the fee is due to be paid by 8 February 2017. If you
have not paid your exam fees on time, you can still pay but you will be charged
an extra fee per subject (currently €32 per subject for applications received
between 9 February and 28 February 2017 inclusive). A second late fee of €52
per subject in addition to the normal fee will apply to applications made from
1 March to 29 April 2017. Entries for subjects with a practical, oral or
project component will not be accepted at this stage.</p>

<p>External candidates who hold a current medical card do not have to pay the
fee but are still liable for late fees if they apply after the deadline.<br></p>

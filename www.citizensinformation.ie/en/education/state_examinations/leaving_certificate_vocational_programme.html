<p>Ireland's Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme is a Leaving Certificate
with a strong vocational aspect. </p>

<p>The programme consists of Leaving Certificate subjects, together with three
compulsory link modules on enterprise education, preparation for work and work
experience. Students must take at least 5 Leaving Certificate subjects, one of
which must be Irish and a continental language or vocational language module.
</p>

<h3>The link modules</h3>

<p>The link modules are activity-based. They usually take a total of 2 to 3
class periods per week, compared with a Leaving Certificate subject, which
generally takes 4 to 5 class periods in a week. </p>

<h3>The subject groupings</h3>

<p>The subject groupings put regular Leaving Certificate subjects that
complement each other into groupings. There are 2 groupings:</p>
<ul><li>Specialist groupings, in which the subject content of each subject is
    helpful to the other, </li>
  <li>Services groupings, where the subjects might work well together from a
    business or commercial point of view. </li>
</ul><p>Students must take 2 subjects from these groupings. </p>

<h3>Assessment and examinations</h3>

<p>The Leaving Certificate subjects are examined through the standard Leaving
Certificate examination. </p>

<p>The link modules are assessed in a written examination representing 40% of
total marks and a portfolio of coursework representing 60% of total marks.</p>

<h3>Certification </h3>

<p>Students receive the same certificate as other Leaving Certificate students,
but their Leaving Certificate includes an additional statement of the results
of the link modules (pass, merit or distinction). </p>

<h3>Access to further study with the Leaving Certificate Vocational
Programme</h3>

<p>The programme gives students the same opportunity to proceed to universities
and colleges as the students taking the <a shape="rect" href="established_leaving_certificate.html">Established Leaving
Certificate</a>. </p>

<p>There is a new grading scheme for the Leaving Certificate in 2017. The new
scheme means that the Common Points Scale used by the CAO to determine entry
into higher education institutions, has also been revised.</p>

<p>From 2017, Institutes of Technology and the universities recognise the link
modules as follows:</p>

<p>Distinction: 66 points</p>

<p>Merit: 46 points</p>

<p>Pass: 28 points</p>

<p>The Leaving Certificate Applied is a distinct, self-contained two-year
Leaving Certificate programme aimed at preparing students for adult and working
life. </p>

<p>The programme sets out to recognise the talents of all students and to
provide opportunities for developing personal responsibility, self-esteem and
self-knowledge. The programme focuses on the talents of each student and helps
students apply what they learn to the real world. </p>

<p>The two-year programme consists of four half-year blocks called sessions.
Achievements are credited in each session. </p>

<p>There is more information in this <a href="http://cmsnew.pdst.ie/sites/default/files/6.%20a.%20LCA%20Overview%20leaflet.pdf">overview
of the Leaving Certificate Applied (pdf)</a>. </p>

<h3>The courses</h3>

<p>Courses are offered in three main areas:</p>
<ul><li>Vocational preparation, involving work experience, enterprise and
    communication </li>
  <li>General education, offering lifeskills, the arts, social education,
    leisure and language </li>
  <li>Vocational education. </li>
</ul><h3>Course structure</h3>

<p>Each course consists of a <a href="http://www.pdst.ie/node/2302">number of
modules</a>. Each module takes place over half a year. There is also a wide
range of practical courses, called vocational specialisms, from which the
student can choose. </p>

<h3>Assessment and examinations</h3>

<p>Assessment is continuous throughout the course and there is a final
examination. </p>

<p>Assessment takes place on the completion of modules and practical activities
that allow the student to integrate the learning from different courses. </p>

<p>The final examination must be taken in the following areas:</p>
<ul><li>English and communication </li>
  <li>Two vocational specialisms </li>
  <li>Mathematical applications </li>
  <li>Language </li>
  <li>Social education. </li>
</ul><p>There are written and oral examinations in all languages. There are
practical examinations in the vocational specialisms. The written examinations
take place in June, at the same time as the examinations for the established
Leaving Certificate. </p>

<h3>The certificate awarded</h3>

<p>Students who successfully complete the programme are awarded a Leaving
Certificate from the Department of Education and Skills. The certificate is
awarded at three levels:</p>

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Level</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Marks and Credits Required</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Pass</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">60-69% (120-139 credits)</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Merit</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">70-84% (140-169 credits)</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Distinction</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">85-100% (170-200 credits)</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>Candidates who get less than 60% (120 credits) or who do not complete the
course, are awarded a record of experience.</p>

<h3>Eligibility for further education and third-level courses</h3>

<p>A student who has been awarded the Leaving Certificate Applied can go on to
a very wide range of <a shape="rect" href="../vocational_education_and_training/training_and_apprentiship_programmes/post_leaving_certificate_courses.html">Post-Leaving
Certificate courses (PLCs)</a>. These are available in local post-primary
schools and colleges.</p>

<p>There are many areas of study - Art/Design, Business, Science,
Services/Leisure and Communications/Media studies.</p>

<p>PLC courses can lead on to an award recognised by the National Framework of
Qualifications (NFQ). You can <a href="http://www.qualifax.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=21">find
out if your course is recognised by NFQ</a>.</p>

<p>Students with the Leaving Certificate Applied cannot gain direct entry
through the Central Applications Office (CAO) system to the universities or
institutes of technology. Many PLC courses lead to either a level 5 or level 6
award. In some cases, you can progress with this award to a third level course
in a higher education institution such as, institutes of technology and
universities. You should discuss your options for progression with your course
provider.</p>

<p>Students cannot go directly to nursing but may be eligible to apply as a
mature student with certain qualifications or relevant experience.</p>

<p>Students with the Leaving Certificate Applied can also go on to FÁS
Apprenticeship programmes. Many students go directly to employment.</p>

<p>The State Examinations Commission oversees the State examinations at second
level in Ireland. These examinations are the Junior Certificate and the Leaving
Certificate. It also organises certain trade and professional examinations. </p>

<p>In 2003 the Commission was established by the Government to take over
responsibility for the development, assessment, accreditation and certification
of the State certificate examinations from the Department of Education and
Science (now Skills). It works in partnership with school authorities and
education providers to run the examination and assessment system in a fair,
accountable and accessible way.</p>

<h3>Responsibilities</h3>

<p>The Commission is responsible for the operation of all aspects of the <a shape="rect" href="established_leaving_certificate.html">established Leaving

examinations including written, oral, aural and practical components and

examinations and arranges to have the examinations marked. This includes the

mark examination components. It is responsible for charging and collecting <a shape="rect" href="examination_fees.html">fees for examinations</a>.</p>

<h3>Examination results</h3>

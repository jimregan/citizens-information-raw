<p>The <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Constitution
of Ireland</a> has a number of articles that are relevant to the law on
education. </p>

<p>Article 42 of the Constitution deals with education. Other articles also
have a bearing on education law, in particular the articles dealing with the
family and religion (Articles 41 and 44). You can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html">read the full text of
the Irish Constitution</a>. </p>

<h3>Education</h3>

<p>This is the text of Article 42 of the Constitution of Ireland:</p>

<p>"1: The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the
child is the Family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of
parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral,
intellectual, physical and social education of their children.</p>

<p>2: Parents shall be free to provide this education in their homes or in
private schools or in schools recognised or established by the State. </p>

<p>3.1°:The State shall not oblige parents in violation of their conscience
and lawful preference to send their children to schools established by the
State, or to any particular type of school designated by the State. </p>

<p>3.2°:The State shall, however, as guardian of the common good, require in
view of actual conditions that the children receive a certain minimum
education, moral, intellectual and social. </p>

<p>4:The State shall provide for free primary education and shall endeavour to
supplement and give reasonable aid to private and corporate educational
initiative, and, when the public good requires it, provide other educational
facilities or institutions with due regard, however, for the rights of parents,
especially in the matter of religious and moral formation." </p>

<h3>The Family</h3>

<p>This is the relevant part of Article 41: </p>

<p>"1.1°: The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and
fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing
inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive
law. </p>

<p>1.2°: The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its
constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as
indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State."</p>

<h3>What these articles mean</h3>

<p>These articles have been the subject of a number of court decisions. In
simple terms, the essential points about these articles are:</p>
<ul><li>The family is the main source of education for the child. Parents are
    entitled to provide education outside the school system if they wish. </li>
  <li>The state may not force parents to send their children to any school or
    any particular kind of school. Parents may decide the school to which they
    wish to send their children but there is no constitutional obligation on a
    particular school to accept individual children. </li>
  <li>The state may require that the children receive a certain minimum
    education. This certain minimum has not yet been defined in legislation or
    in official policy. Many of the court cases have been about the precise
    meaning of that phrase. </li>
  <li>The state is obliged to provide for free primary education. It is not
    obliged to provide that education directly. In practice, there are some
    state schools but the majority of primary schools are privately owned and
    largely state funded. See <a shape="rect" href="../primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_primary_school/ownership_of_primary_schools.html">ownership
    of primary schools</a> </li>
  <li>The state is not obliged to directly provide schools but it is not
    prevented from doing so either. </li>
</ul><h3>Minimum education</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0022/index.html">Education
(Welfare) Act 2000</a> does not give a definition of a "minimum education".
However, it does provide that the Minister may set out a "prescribed minimum
education". That minimum standard may be different for children of different
ages and of different capacities - including physical, mental and emotional
capacities. </p>

<p>The Act also provides that children educated outside the mainstream school
system are to be identified and assessed in order to ensure that the education
they are receiving meets the minimum standards. The register is maintained by
the <a href="http://www.newb.ie/parent_guardian/childs_education.asp">Child and
Family Agency</a>. </p>

<h3>Free primary education</h3>

<p>In the Sinnott case, the Supreme Court decided that the right to free
primary education ends at age 18 and does not continue on the basis of need.</p>

<h3>Religion</h3>

<p>This is the relevant part of Article 44: </p>

<p>2.2°: The State guarantees not to endow any religion.</p>

<p>2.3°: The State shall not impose any disabilities or make any
discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief or status. </p>

<p>2.4°: Legislation providing State aid for schools shall not discriminate
between schools under the management of different religious denominations, nor
be such as to affect prejudicially the right of any child to attend a school
receiving public money without attending religious instruction at that school.
</p>

<p>2.5°: Every religious denomination shall have the right to manage its own
affairs, own, acquire and administer property, movable and immovable, and
maintain institutions for religious or charitable purposes. </p>

<p>2.6°: The property of any religious denomination or any educational
institution shall not be diverted save for necessary works of public utility
and on payment of compensation. </p>

<p>This article means that there may not be discrimination between the
different denominations and that children have the right to attend state aided
schools without attending religious instruction. In practice, certain time
periods may be set aside for religious instruction and the parents have a right
to withdraw the child at these times. However, the nature of the curriculum is
such that there is not generally a rigid divide between subjects and the school
ethos tends to pervade all subjects. </p>

<p>It has been argued that the article means that a child may not be refused
access to a publicly funded school on the basis of the child's religious
beliefs. </p>

<p>Educational establishments in Ireland are subject to the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0008/index.html">Equal
Status Acts 2000-2011</a><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0008/index.html"></a>.
(Educational establishments in this context refers to preschools, primary,
post-primary, an institution providing adult, continuing or further education,
a university, third level or higher level institution whether or not they are
publicly funded.) You can find an information booklet about <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Publications/Education-Reports/ge_schools_and_equality.pdf">Schools
and the Equal Status Acts (pdf)</a> on the Department of Education and Skills
website.</p>

<p>Under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0008/sec0007.html#partii-sec7">Section
7</a> of the Equal Status Act 2000 denominational schools are permitted to
refuse to admit non co-religionists in certain circumstances. </p>

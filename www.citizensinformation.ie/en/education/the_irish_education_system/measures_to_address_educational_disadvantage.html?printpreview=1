<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>Educational disadvantage refers to the situation where some individuals get
less benefit from the education system than their peers. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0051/index.html">Education
Act 1998</a> defines educational disadvantage as “the impediments to
education arising from social or economic disadvantage which prevent students
from deriving appropriate benefit from education in schools”. Educational
disadvantage is demonstrated in many ways, most often in poor levels of
participation and achievement in the formal education system. </p>

<p>There are other ways in which children may be disadvantaged, for example as
a result of a disability, literacy difficulties, ill health, poverty etc. Read
about the supports for their education in <a shape="rect" href="special_education.html">special needs education</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../primary_and_post_primary_educational_supports/national_educational_psychological_service.html">psychological
services for schools</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../primary_and_post_primary_educational_supports/school_books_scheme.html">financial
help with going to school</a>. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l736dc">Delivering Equality of Opportunity in
Schools (DEIS)</h2>

<p>The Department of Education and Skills had a range of national programmes in
place to address educational disadvantage throughout the public school system.
In 2005, following a review of these programmes, the Department published <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Publications/Policy-Reports/deis_action_plan_on_educational_inclusion.pdf">DEIS
- Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools: an action plan for educational
inclusion (pdf)</a>. The plan brought a number of those programmes together
under the framework of Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS).
DEIS is a more integrated approach to the issue of educational inclusion which
provides for: </p>
<ul><li>A standardised system for identifying and regularly reviewing levels of
    disadvantage and </li>
  <li>A new integrated School Support Programme (SSP) to bring together and
    build upon the previous schemes and programmes </li>
</ul><p>There is a <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-/deis_school_list.xls">list
of DEIS schools</a>. </p>

<p>The School Support Programme involving the Home School Community Liaison
Scheme (HSCL), the School Completion Programme (SCP) and the Visiting Teachers
Service for Travellers (VTST) were integrated into the National Educational
Welfare Board (NEWB) whose functions transferred to the <a href="http://www.tusla.ie/">Child and Family Agency</a> in January 2014.</p>

<h3>Early Start Pre-School Scheme </h3>

<p>Early Start is a one-year preventative intervention scheme offered to
pre-school children (3 to 4 years old) in some schools in designated
disadvantaged areas. <a shape="rect" href="../pre_school_education_and_childcare/early_start.html">More detailed
information about Early Start is available</a>. </p>

<h3>School Completion Programme </h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.tusla.ie/services/educational-welfare-services/school-support-services-under-the-deis-initiative/school-completion-programme">School
Completion Programme</a> aims to help students from disadvantaged areas stay in
school to complete their Leaving Certificate. It is a support strand within the
Child and Family Agency under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. It
forms part of the Department of Education and Skills social inclusion strategy
Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) to help children and young
people who are at risk of or who are experiencing educational disadvantage. </p>

<h3>Home-School Community Liaison Scheme </h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../primary_and_post_primary_education/attendance_and_discipline_in_schools/home_school_liaison.html">Home-School
Community Liaison Scheme</a> aims to improve co-operation between home, schools
and communities to advance the educational interests of disadvantaged children.
</p>

<h3>The Learning Support Teacher Scheme</h3>

<p>Learning support teachers provide extra support teaching for children
experiencing learning difficulties, particularly in the core areas of literacy
and numeracy. Generally this extra support is provided in the form of extra
teaching in small groups or individually. </p>

<h3>School Meals Programme </h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/OperationalGuidelines/Pages/swa_schoolm.aspx">School
Meals Programme</a> aims to supplement the diets of school-going children from
disadvantaged backgrounds to help them fulfil their potential within the
educational system and to reduce the risk of early school-leaving. There are
two schemes.</p>

<p>The Urban Scheme supports school meals for primary schools in urban areas.
This programme consists of daily sandwiches or buns and milk. The scheme is not
a replacement for home meals. </p>

<p>The Local Projects Scheme gives funding directly to national and secondary
schools, local groups and voluntary organisations, which operate their own
school meals projects (the meals may be hot or cold). It also covers nursery
schools catering for disadvantaged pre-school children. These meals must be
targeted at areas of disadvantage or at children with special needs. Funding is
allocated on the basis of a rate per meal per child. <br>
Funding for school meals comes from the Department of Social Protection and
local authorities. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lffe6a">Special projects for disadvantaged youth
</h2>

<p>These projects are geared towards young people in the second-level education
age group but they are also relevant for some primary school students. </p>

<h3>DES Projects for Disadvantaged Youth </h3>

<p>Under this scheme, grants are allocated by the Department of Education and
Skills (DES) in respect of special out-of-school projects for disadvantaged
young people. Priority is given to projects in the spheres of special youth
work initiatives, young homeless people, young substance abusers and young
Travellers. </p>

<p>The projects are aimed at facilitating the personal development and social
education of young people at risk of drug abuse, juvenile crime, early school
leaving, social exclusion, unemployment, welfare dependence,<a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/losing_your_home/homelessness.html">homelessness</a> and
marginalisation. In particular, they seek to realise the potential of young
people and to equip them with the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for
their appropriate integration in society. </p>

<h3>Youth Information Centres </h3>

<p>The DES funds the network of <a shape="rect" href="http://dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/youthaffairs/YICentres2014.pdf">Youth
Information Centres (pdf)</a> which provide young people with access to
information on rights, opportunities, benefits, health, welfare and other
matters. </p>

<h3>Young People's Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF) </h3>

<p>This was established to help in the development of preventative strategies
in a targeted manner through the development of youth facilities, including
sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a
significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The aim of the
fund is to attract young people in these areas at risk of becoming involved in
drugs into more healthy and productive pursuits. </p>

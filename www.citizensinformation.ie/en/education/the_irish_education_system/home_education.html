<p>Parents have a constitutional right to educate their children at home. If
you choose to home-school your child, you do not need a formal teaching
qualification or curriculum but you must ensure that your child receives a
certain minimum education. You can adopt the approach you feel best suits the
learning needs of your child to make sure that he or she is learning
successfully and making reasonable progress, given his or her age, ability,
aptitude and learning needs. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Legislation</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="constitution_and_education.html">Irish
constitution</a> recognises the family as the primary educator of the child and
defines duties and responsibilities for parents and the State in the education
of children. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0022/sec0014.html#partiii-sec14">Section
14</a> of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0022/index.html">Education
(Welfare) Act 2000</a> makes provision for parents to educate their children in
places other than recognised schools, such as in the home or in private schools
where they are not required to follow a national curriculum. The Act states
that parents must ensure their child receives a certain minimum education. <a href="http://www.newb.ie/downloads/pdf/guidelines_assessment_education_outside_schools.pdf">Guidelines
on the Assessment of Education in places other than recognised schools
(pdf)</a> have been published under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0022/sec0016.html#partiii-sec16">section
16</a> of the Act. The guidelines provide a working definition of “a certain
minimum education”, describe home-based education and offer guidance on how
it may be assessed. They also cover the legal background of home education.</p>

<h3>Minimum education</h3>

<p>The State has a duty to ensure that children receive a certain minimum
education, but parents are free to determine how this education is provided.
The law does not define a “certain minimum education”. The guidelines
provide a definition of the broad characteristics, which require that a
child’s education should:</p>
<ul><li>Be suited to the age, ability, aptitude and personality of the child </li>
  <li>Be responsive to the child’s individual needs, should take cognisance
    of the areas of learning that are of interest to the child, and should
    ensure that his/her personal potential is enhanced and not suppressed </li>
  <li>Address the immediate and prospective needs of the child, in the context
    of the cultural, economic and social environment </li>
  <li>Provide a reasonably balanced range of learning experiences, so that no
    one aspect of the child’s learning is emphasised to the exclusion of
    others </li>
  <li>Develop the personal and social skills of the child and prepare him/her
    for the responsibilities of citizenship </li>
  <li>Contribute to the moral development of the child </li>
  <li>Provide opportunities for the child to develop his/her intellectual
    capacities and understanding </li>
</ul><p>The guidelines also require that basic skills, without which a child would
be placed at a serious disadvantage, should be taken into account in a
definition of this minimum education. Development and progression in oral
language, literacy and numeracy are vital for other areas of learning and for
the child to participate in society and everyday life.</p>

<h3>Role of the Child and Family Agency</h3>

<p>The Child and Family Agency is obliged to maintain a register of children
who are receiving education but not attending a recognised school. In effect,
this register will show the names of children who are being educated at home or
in private non-recognised schools. All parents or guardians who want to educate
their children at home must register their child with the Child and Family
Agency. Parents of children who attend private non recognised schools should
make an application through the school. Registration is not automatic. It is a
legal obligation and the onus is on parents or guardians to make an application
on behalf of their child.</p>

<p>On 1 January 2014, the National Educational Welfare Board was abolished and
its functions transferred to the <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2FChidFamilySupportAgency%2FAgencyMainPage.htm">Child
and Family Agency</a>. </p>

<h3>The registration process<br></h3>

<p>You can apply directly to the Child and Family Agency – see ‘Where to
apply’ below. The Child and Family Agency will send you an application form
and a copy of the guidelines <a href="http://www.newb.ie/downloads/pdf/guidelines_assessment_education_outside_schools.pdf">Guidelines
on the assessment of education in places other than recognised schools
(pdf)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> when you return the application form you will
be contacted by the person who will carry out the assessment to arrange a
convenient time and date. This person is authorised by the Child and Family
Agency and is experienced in education. The assessment will focus on the
details of the education that is being provided to the child, the materials
used in the course of the education and the time spent providing that
education. The interview can take place in a venue of your choice and will be
based on what you have said in your application. This is called the
<strong>preliminary assessment</strong>. Your assessor will complete a draft
assessment report and a copy of this is forwarded to you for comment. Following
the report your child’s name will either be entered into the register or your
case will be referred for a comprehensive assessment.</p>

<p>If the Child and Family Agency is not able to determine whether you are
providing a minimum education, a <strong>comprehensive assessment</strong> will
be carried out. This is more in-depth and involves the assessor spending some
time with you, observing how you teach or work with your child, inspecting your
educational materials and talking to your child. </p>

<h3>The appeals process</h3>

<p>If the Child and Family Agency decides that you are not providing a certain
minimum education for your child, it can refuse to register or remove your
child’s name from the register. It must inform you of its decision in writing
and you have 21 days to appeal against the decision. The Minister will appoint
a committee to hear the appeal and make a decision on the case. An appeal
committee is made up of a District Court judge, an inspector and such other
person as may be appointed thereto by the Minister. You and the assessor are
invited to make submissions on the case. Depending on their decision, the
committee will:</p>
<ul><li>Affirm the decision of the Child and Family Agency to remove or refuse to
    add your child’s name to the register </li>
  <li>Require the Child and Family Agency to add your child’s name to the
    register </li>
  <li>Require the Child and Family Agency to add your child’s name to the
    register, subject to your undertaking to comply with any requirements the
    appeal committee considers appropriate. </li>
</ul><h3>State examinations</h3>

<p>When it comes time to sit formal exams, arrangements can be made through <a shape="rect" href="http://www.etbi.ie/etbs/directory-of-etbs/">Education and
Training Boards (ETBs)</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../adult_and_life_long_education/adult_education.html">adult education
classes</a>. <a shape="rect" href="../state_examinations/junior_certificate_programme.html">Junior </a>and
<a shape="rect" href="../state_examinations/established_leaving_certificate.html">Leaving
Certificate</a> examinations can also be sat at any school by registering with
the school in early January of the year that the exams will be taken. Further
information is available from the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.examinations.ie">State Examinations Commission</a>.</p>

<h3>Third-level education</h3>

<p>If a child does not sit State examinations then entry to third-level
education in Ireland is difficult. The normal route into Irish third-level
institutions is through the Leaving Certificate. However, it may also be
possible to enter third-level education at aged 17 or 18 without the Leaving
Certificate by interview only. You would need to approach your chosen
institution to discuss this possibility. There are a variety of courses for the
16-plus age group which are accepted as valid for entry to third-level courses.
You can find out more about further and higher education and training courses
from <a href="http://www.qualifax.ie/">Qualifax - The National Learner's
Database</a>.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../third_level_education/applying_to_college/third_level_courses_for_mature_students.html">Mature
students</a> are not subject to the usual entry requirements. There are also a
growing number of correspondence courses on offer, such as the Open University.
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.aontas.com/whatnext/9/distance-online-flexible-and-blended-learning/">Aontas
- the National Association of Adult Education</a> is a source of information on
distance learning in Ireland.</p>

<h3>Home Education Network</h3>

<p>If you choose to teach your child at home, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.henireland.org">Home Education Network</a> is a support and
lobby group for home educators in Ireland. It aims to help parents use the
available resources to develop educational techniques suitable for each
child’s needs. It also provides a means for the exchange of ideas and
experience among home educators through regular meetings and newsletters. Its
website contains links to research and online information about home education
and it also operates a library service of books on home education that is
available to members. </p>

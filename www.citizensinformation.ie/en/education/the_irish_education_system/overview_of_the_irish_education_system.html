<p>Education is compulsory for children in Ireland from the ages of six to 16
or until students have completed three years of second-level education.</p>

<p>The Irish education system is made up of primary, second, third-level and
further education. State-funded education is available at all levels, unless
you choose to send your child to a private institution.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../pre_school_education_and_childcare/">Pre-school
education</a> is usually provided by privately funded childcare facilities or
providers. The <a href="../pre_school_education_and_childcare/early_childhood_care_and_education_scheme.html">Early
Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme</a> provides a free year of early
childhood care and education for children of pre-school age. Some pre-school
initiatives focused on children <em>at risk</em> are funded by the Department
of Education and Skills.</p>

<h3>Primary (first-level) education</h3>

<p>Children do not have to attend school until the age of six but it is usual
for children to begin school the September following their fourth birthday.
Four-year-olds and five-year-olds are enrolled in the junior or senior infant
classes.</p>

<p>The curriculum for primary education covers the following key areas:<br>
Language, mathematics, social, environment and scientific education, arts
education including visual arts music and drama, physical integration, social
personal and health education.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_primary_school/types_primary_school.html">Primary
schools</a> are generally privately owned by religious communities (or boards
of governors) but are State-funded.</p>

<h3>Second-level education</h3>

<p>Second-level education is provided by different types of post-primary
schools. That is, secondary, vocational, community and comprehensive schools.
Secondary schools are privately owned and managed. In most cases the trustees
are religious communities or boards of governors. Vocational schools are
established by the State and administered by vocational education committees.
Community and comprehensive schools are managed by boards of management of
differing compositions.</p>

<p>Second-level education consists of a three-year junior cycle followed by a
two-year or three-year senior cycle depending on whether an optional <a shape="rect" href="../primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_post_primary_school/transition_year.html">Transition
Year</a> is taken following the <a shape="rect" href="../state_examinations/junior_certificate_programme.html">Junior
Certificate</a> examination.</p>

<p>Students generally commence the junior cycle at the age of 12. The Junior
Certificate is taken after three years.</p>

<p>Transition Year follows the Junior Certificate examination. This year is
free from formal examinations and allows students to experience a wide range of
educational inputs, including work experience. </p>

<p>During their final two years in the senior cycle, students take one of three
programmes, each leading to a State examination - the established Leaving
Certificate, the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme or the Leaving
Certificate Applied. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../state_examinations/established_leaving_certificate.html">established
Leaving Certificate</a> is the main basis upon which places in universities,
institutes of technology and colleges of education are allocated.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../state_examinations/leaving_certificate_vocational_programme.html">Leaving
Certificate Vocational Programme</a> differs from the established Leaving
Certificate in placing a concentration on technical subjects and including
additional modules which have a vocational focus.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../state_examinations/leaving_certificate_applied.html">Leaving
Certificate Applied Programme</a> has as its primary objective the preparation
of participants for adult and working life through relevant learning
experiences. These aim to develop the following areas of human endeavour:
spiritual, intellectual, social, emotional, aesthetic and physical.</p>

<p>The Leaving Certificate Applied is not recognised for direct entry to
third-level courses but it can enable students to take Post-Leaving Certificate
courses.</p>

<h3>Third-level education</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../third_level_education/">Third-level education</a>
is made up of a number of sectors. The university sector, the technological
sector and the colleges of education are substantially funded by the State. In
addition there are a number of independent private colleges.</p>

<p>There are seven universities, which are autonomous and self-governing. They
offer degree programmes at bachelor, masters and doctorate level.</p>

<p>The technological sector includes institutes of technology which provide
programmes of education and training in areas such as business, science,
engineering, linguistics and music to certificate, diploma and degree levels.
The Department of Education and Skills has overall responsibility for the
sector.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.teachingcouncil.ie/teacher-education/initial-teacher-education-ite.191.html">colleges
of education</a> specialise in training for first-level teachers. They offer a
three-year bachelor of education degree and a postgraduate diploma.</p>

<p>The training of second-level teachers usually involves completing a primary
degree in university or other third-level institution followed by a one-year
higher diploma in education. In addition, there are colleges of education that
specialise in the training of second-level home economics teachers, teachers of
religion and physical education.</p>

<h3>Further and adult education</h3>

<p>Further education comprises education and training which takes place after
second-level schooling but which is not part of the third-level system. It
includes programmes such as <a shape="rect" href="../vocational_education_and_training/training_and_apprentiship_programmes/post_leaving_certificate_courses.html">Post-Leaving
Certificate</a> courses; the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme
(second-chance education for the unemployed); programmes in <a shape="rect" href="../vocational_education_and_training/training_and_apprentiship_programmes/youthreach.html">Youthreach</a>
for early school-leavers; other literacy and basic education; and self-funded
evening adult programmes in second-level schools.</p>

<h3>Special needs education for students with disabilities</h3>

<p>Educational provision for <a shape="rect" href="special_education.html">students with special educational needs</a>
ranges from additional support in mainstream schools to specialist support in
special schools. A student with a disability may be enrolled in a:</p>
<ul><li>Mainstream class with additional support </li>
  <li>Special class in a mainstream school or </li>
  <li>Special school which caters for the students with his or her category of
    disability. </li>

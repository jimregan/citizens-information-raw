<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>Special needs education means the special educational arrangements which are
in place for children with disabilities. All children – including children
with disabilities and children with special needs – have a constitutional
right to free primary education. Children with special educational needs have
the right to free primary education up to age 18 see ‘The law on special
needs education’ below. In the <a shape="rect" href="constitution_and_education.html">Irish Constitution there is information
about the role of the State in providing education and the rights of
parents</a>.</p>

<p>You are a person with special educational needs if your capacity to
participate in and benefit from education is restricted due to an enduring
physical, sensory, mental health or learning disability. The policy is to
provide special needs education in mainstream settings as far as possible. The
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2004/A3004.pdf">Education
for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 (pdf)</a> provides that
children are to be educated in an inclusive setting unless this would not be in
the best interests of the child or the effective provision of education for
other children in mainstream education.</p>

<p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has published an
information booklet for parents, <a href="http://ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ChildrenWithSpecialEdNeeds1.pdf">Children
with Special Educational Needs (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>Education for children with special needs may be provided in mainstream
classes in mainstream schools, in special classes in mainstream schools or in
special schools. </p>

<p><span><strong>Mainstream classes</strong></span></p>

<p>Many children with disabilities or special needs are in mainstream classes
in mainstream schools. They may get help from learning support and resource
teachers and care support from special needs assistants (SNAs). You can read
more about these supports for children with special educational needs in our
documents on special needs education in <a shape="rect" href="../primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_primary_school/special_needs_education_primary_schools.html">primary
schools</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_post_primary_school/post_primary_education_for_students_with_special_needs.html">post-primary
schools.</a> </p>

<p><span><strong>Special classes in mainstream schools</strong></span></p>

<p>Some children attend special classes in mainstream schools. These classes
generally have low pupil/teacher ratios.</p>

<p><span><strong>Special schools</strong></span></p>

<p><span></span>There are over 140 special schools catering for particular
types of disability and special needs. Among them are: special schools for
students who have a general learning disability at a mild or moderate level;
schools for visually impaired and hearing impaired students; a few schools for
students with physical disabilities; a small number of special schools for
students who are emotionally disturbed. </p>

<p>You can find the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/find-a-school">special
schools</a> in your area on the website of the Department of Education and
Skills.</p>

<p><strong>Special arrangements for particular disabilities</strong></p>

<p>Students with specific leaning disabilities may be able to get an exemption
from some of the usual educational requirements. For example, if you have
dyslexia you may be exempt from the requirement to study Irish and/or a
continental language. </p>

<p><strong>Education plans</strong></p>

<p>Under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 (the
EPSEN Act) each child assessed with a special educational need should have a
personal education plan. This system is not yet in place but its implementation
is being coordinated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which
has published <a shape="rect" href="http://ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/final_report.pdf">Guidelines
for the Individual Education Plan process (pdf)</a>. The NCSE has also
published Implementation Report: Plan for the Phased Implementation of the
EPSEN Act 2004. This sets out how the Act can be implemented. However there is
currently no date for the implementation of the assessment of need and
individual education plans.</p>

<p><strong>Transport</strong></p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_primary_school/school_transport_for_children_with_special_needs.html">Special
transport arrangements,</a> including escorts and safety harnesses are
available for children with disabilities attending school. </p>

<h2 class="further_info" id="l46600">The law on special needs education</h2>

<p>There have been significant legal changes in recent years concerning special
needs education. These changes affect the rights of children with disabilities
and other children who suffer educational disadvantage for whatever reason. </p>

<p>Special needs education means the special education arrangements in place
for children with disabilities. <a shape="rect" href="measures_to_address_educational_disadvantage.html">Measures to address
educational disadvantage</a> describes the supports provided for educationally
disadvantaged children. </p>

<h2>Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 </h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2004/A3004.pdf">Education
for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 (pdf)</a> provides for the
education of children aged under 18 years with special educational needs. The
Act focuses on children’s education but there are references to further and
adult education. You are a person with special educational needs if your
capacity to participate in and benefit from education is restricted due to an
enduring physical, sensory, mental health or learning disability. While the Act
is passed, all parts of it are not fully in effect. </p>

<p>The Act: </p>
<ul><li>
    <div>
    Provides that people with special educational needs are educated in an
    inclusive environment, as far as possible</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    Establishes that people with special educational needs have the same right
    to avail of and benefit from education as children who do not have those
    needs </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    Provides for the greater involvement of parents in the education of their
    children and decision making </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    Establishes the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) on a
    statutory basis </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    Gives statutory functions to the Health Service Executive with regard to
    the education of people with special educational needs </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    Establishes an independent appeals system – the Special Education Appeals
    Board – where decisions made about the education of people with special
    educational needs can be appealed </div>
  </li>
</ul><p>The Act sets out a range of services to be provided to people with special
educational needs. These include assessments, education plans and other support
services. Parents can seek assessments of a child’s educational needs.
Assessments can be initiated by the Health Service Executive (HSE), by a school
principal or by the National Council for Special Education. The system for
personal education plans is not yet in place and its implementation is being
co-ordinated by the NCSE.</p>

<p>The HSE is currently responsible for providing health services to pre-school
children and may provide speech and language therapy services. The NCSE will be
responsible for providing services to school-going children. </p>

<h3>The Special Education Appeals Board and mediation </h3>

<p>The 2004 Act provides for alternative methods of dispute resolution and
encourages a move away from the courts as the forum for redress. The Special
Education Appeals Board was established in 2006 for the resolution of disputes
and the determination of appeals and the first Board members were appointed. <a href="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/2011/05/04/00043.asp">The Board is not
yet in operation.</a></p>

<p>When the Appeals Board comes into operation, the Act provides for the
following: </p>
<ul><li>If the council refuses to arrange an assessment of a child or to prepare
    an education plan, the parents of the child or the school principal may
    appeal to the Appeals Board. </li>
  <li>The Appeals Board will have the power to direct the council to arrange
    the preparation of an assessment or of an education plan. In this case, the
    council must comply with the direction of the Appeals Board. </li>
  <li>The Appeals Board may dismiss the appeal of the parents or principal. The
    2004 Act also provides for a process of mediation following the exhaustion
    of any rights of appeal under the legislation. </li>
</ul><h2>The Education Act 1998 </h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0051/index.html">Education
Act 1998</a> deals with education generally but emphasises the rights of
children with disabilities and with other special educational needs. This Act
is in effect and provides that every person concerned with the implementation
of the legislation must have regard to a number of objectives including: </p>
<ul><li>To give practical effect to the constitutional rights of children
    including children who have a disability or who have other special
    educational needs, as they relate to education </li>
  <li>To provide that, as far as is practicable and having regard to the
    resources available, a level and quality of education appropriate to the
    needs and abilities of the people of the country </li>
</ul><p>The Minister for Education and Skills is obliged, among other things, to
ensure that everyone living in Ireland (including people with disabilities and
people who have other special educational needs) has available support services
and a level and quality of education appropriate to his/her needs and
abilities. </p>

<h3>Funding </h3>

<p>The 1998 Act gives the Minister for Education and Skills certain functions
in respect of funding, including the funding of support services for students
with disabilities. </p>

<p>Schools must use their available resources to ensure that the educational
needs of all students, including those with disabilities, are identified and
provided for. </p>

<p>Boards of Management are required to use the State resources provided to the
school to make reasonable provisions and accommodation for students with
disabilities or other special education needs, including, where necessary,
alteration of buildings and the provision of appropriate equipment. </p>

<p>The Act also provides that the criteria for funding of schools may allow for
the payment of additional grants to schools, having regard to the level of
educational disadvantage. </p>

<h3>Support services </h3>

<p>The 1998 Act defines support services as including, among other things: </p>
<ul><li>Assessment of students </li>
  <li>Guidance and counselling services </li>
  <li>Technical aids and equipment, including means of access to schools,
    adaptations to buildings to facilitate access and transport for students
    with special needs and their families </li>
  <li>Provision for students learning through Irish sign language or other sign
    language, including interpreting services </li>
  <li>Speech therapy services </li>
  <li>Provision for early childhood, primary, post-primary, adult or continuing
    education to students with special needs otherwise than in schools or
    centres for education </li>
</ul><h2>The Equal Status Acts 2000-2011 <br></h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0008/index.html">Equal
Status Act 2000</a>-2011, outlaws discrimination in areas of life - mainly the
provision of services. The Acts apply to educational services, including
private schools and pre-school facilities. </p>

<p>There are certain specific provisions in the Acts in relation to education
and some of these deal with people with disabilities or people who have special
needs. </p>

<p>The Equal Status Acts outlaw direct and indirect discrimination on a number
of grounds including gender, religion, disability, race and membership of the
Traveller community. </p>

<p>Under the law, a school may not discriminate in relation to: </p>
<ul><li>The admission or the terms and conditions of admission of a student </li>
  <li>The access of a student to any course, facility or benefit provided </li>
  <li>Any other term or condition of participation in the school by the student
  </li>
  <li>The expulsion of a student or any other sanction </li>
</ul><h3>Discrimination on grounds of disability <br></h3>

<p>The Equal Status Acts set out certain activities that do not constitute
discrimination. The following relate to discrimination on the grounds of
disability: </p>
<ul><li>Schools may make different arrangements for sport for children on the
    basis of age, gender or disability if these are reasonably necessary. </li>
  <li>Schools will not be considered to discriminate against a student with a
    disability if compliance with the provisions of the legislation would have
    a seriously detrimental effect on or make impossible the provision of
    services to other students. </li>
  <li>In certain circumstances, discrimination on the grounds of disability can
    occur if there is a failure to do all that is reasonable to accommodate the
    needs of a person with a disability. If a person with a disability cannot
    avail of a service without the provision of special treatment or facilities
    then the service provider may be required to provide such special
    arrangements if there is only a nominal cost involved. </li>
  <li>The Act includes a provision that clarifies that the nominal cost issue
    does not prejudice or dilute the various provisions in the Education Act
    1998 in relation to children with a disability. It should be noted that
    these provisions all relate to the use of public funds. This means that
    private primary schools are only obliged to make special provision for
    children with disabilities if there is only a nominal cost involved. </li>

<p>The Department of Education and Skills allows students to apply to be
excused from studying Irish in primary and post-primary school. </p>

<p>The circumstances in which a student will be given this exemption are very
limited. Where a student has lived abroad or does not speak English, they may
be exempted. Students with certain disabilities may also be exempted.
Information about primary school is in <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/pc12_96.doc">Circular
12/96 Revision of Circular 18/79 on Exemption from the Study of Irish</a> and
about secondary school in <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/ppc10_94.pdf">Circular
M10/94</a>.</p>

<p>Where <a href="../third_level_education/applying_to_college/application_procedures_and_entry_requirements.html">entry
to a third-level course</a> requires a student to have a certain mark in Irish
at the <a shape="rect" href="../state_examinations/established_leaving_certificate.html">Leaving
Certificate</a> examination, students who have been exempted from the study of
Irish may also be exempted from this requirement. This is a matter for each
individual college. The student applying for a third-level course through the
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.cao.ie/">Central Applications Office (CAO)</a>
should send a copy of the exemption certificate with his/her CAO application
form. </p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>The application for exemption is made by the parent or guardian to the
school principal. The application should state the reasons why the exemption is
being sought. </p>

<p>The parent or guardian must attach documentary evidence of the student's
age, and previous schooling if it is relevant to the reason for the exemption
being sought.</p>

<p>If the exemption is sought on the grounds of a disability, the parent or
guardian must supply evidence of the disability from a qualified psychologist
and may also require a report from an appropriate medical specialist - you
should check the requirements with your child's school. </p>

<p>The school authorities then prepare a full report on the student.</p>

<p>Where an exemption is granted, a certificate of exemption is sent to the
school. This signed by the school principal. It is the responsibility of the
school principal to tell the parent/student about the result of the
application.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="constitution_and_education.html">Irish
Constitution</a> states that parents have primary responsibility for educating
their child and it guarantees the parents’ right and duty to provide for
their children’s education. It also says that the State requires that
children receive 'a certain minimum education'. This certain minimum has not
yet been defined in legislation or in official policy. </p>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0022/index.html">Education
(Welfare) Act 2000</a> parents must make sure that their children receive a
certain minimum education from the age of 6 to the age of 16. According to the
Act there is no absolute legal obligation on children to attend school or on
their parents to send them to school. Parents may decide the school to which
they wish to send their children but there is no constitutional obligation on a
particular school to accept individual children. Parents are also entitled to
provide education outside the school system if they wish. This could mean <a shape="rect" href="home_education.html">home education</a> or private schools
which do not follow a national curriculum. </p>

<p>There is a range of organisations and schemes providing support and
information to parents concerning the education of their children. They include
the following:</p>

<h3>Child and Family Agency</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.tusla.ie/">Child and Family Agency</a>
is the Government agency responsible for making sure that children <a shape="rect" href="../primary_and_post_primary_education/attendance_and_discipline_in_schools/school_attendance.html">attend
school regularly or otherwise get an education</a>. The Agency’s educational
welfare officers (EWOs) work with schools, teachers and parents with a view to
encouraging regular school attendance and developing strategies to reduce
absenteeism and early school leaving. The EWOs also act as advocates or
supports to parents, guardians and children experiencing difficulty with school
attendance or educational welfare.</p>

<p>On 1 January 2014, the National Educational Welfare Board was abolished and
its functions transferred to the <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2FChidFamilySupportAgency%2FAgencyMainPage.htm">Child
and Family Agency</a>. </p>

<h3>Parents’ associations</h3>

<p>Parents have a legal right to establish a parents’ association and
membership must be open to all parents in the school. The primary aim of a
parents’ association is to represent the interests of parents of children
attending the school and to promote good relationships between parents and the
school board of management, the principal and the teachers. The association can
make representations to the school on issues of policy and advise the principal
and board on any matter affecting the school. It can also adopt a programme of
activities that will promote the involvement of parents in the management of
the school. </p>

<p>The important role of parents' associations is described in the circulars on
parents as partners in education: <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/24_91.doc">24/91
(primary schools)</a> and <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/m27_91.doc">M27/91
(post-primary schools)</a>, which are available on the website of the
Department of Education and Skills.</p>

<h3>National Parents Councils</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.npcpp.ie/">National Parents Council –
Post Primary</a> runs a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.npcpp.ie/helpline/">Leaving Certificate results helpline</a>
every August in association with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors. <br>
The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.npc.ie/">National Parents Council
(Primary)</a> has published guidelines on <a shape="rect" href="http://www.npc.ie/attachments/cbdcfd37-98b5-4698-86aa-3f30c38fcecd.pdf">Working
Effectively as a Parent Association (pdf)</a>, which are available from the
Council or can be downloaded from its website - see 'Where to apply' below.
Among its activities it gives information to parents about parents'
associations and children’s learning. It has a helpline for parents seeking
help, information and support for <a href="http://www.npc.ie/group.aspx?contentid=70">special interest groups</a>.
</p>

<h3>Boards of management</h3>

<p>Most schools have boards of management. Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0051/index.html">Education
Act 1998</a> the <a shape="rect" href="../primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_primary_school/boards_of_management.html">board
of management in a school</a> has a duty to ensure that the school is run for
the benefit of the students and their parents and that an appropriate education
is provided for each student at the school. One of the responsibilities of the
board of management is to promote contact between the school, the parents and
the community and give reasonable help to a parents’ association in its
formation and its activities. </p>

<h3>Educate Together</h3>

<p>This is the organisation that represents multi-denominational <a href="http://www.educatetogether.ie/our-schools">Educate Together primary
schools and associations</a> throughout Ireland. The schools are recognised by
the Department of Education and Skills and work under the same regulations and
funding structures as other national schools. Educate Together schools have a
distinct ethos which guarantees equality of access to children irrespective of
their social, cultural or religious backgrounds. They also have a high level of
parental participation in the operation of the school. </p>

<h3>Home School Community Liaison Scheme</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../primary_and_post_primary_education/attendance_and_discipline_in_schools/home_school_liaison.html">Home
School Community Liaison Scheme</a> is targeted at children in primary and
post-primary schools who are at risk of dropping out of school or of not
reaching their potential in the education system because of <a shape="rect" href="measures_to_address_educational_disadvantage.html">economic or social
disadvantage.</a> In each local area the scheme co-ordinator is a qualified
teacher appointed from the staff of the schools in the scheme. The
co-ordinators work full-time outside the classroom to build relationships with
the children’s parents or guardians. They act as a link between home and
school, encouraging parents to become more involved in their children’s
education.</p>

<h3>Early Start Programme<br></h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../pre_school_education_and_childcare/early_start.html">Early Start
Programme</a> is a one-year preventative intervention scheme. It tackles
educational disadvantage by targeting children between the ages of 3 and 4 who
are at risk of not reaching their potential within the school system. The
programme aims to expose young children to an educational programme which would
enhance their overall development and prevent school failure and to offset the
effects of social disadvantage. Parental involvement is a key element in the
programme and the parents of participating children become actively involved in
their children's education. Early Start staff work with Home School Community
Liaison co-ordinators to encourage parents to take part in both the everyday
management and in the organisation of activities in the Early Start centre.</p>

<h3>National Council for Special Education</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ncse.ie/">National Council for Special
Education (NCSE)</a> is a statutory body with responsibility for improving the
delivery of education services to people with <a shape="rect" href="special_education.html">special educational needs</a>. One of its primary
roles is to provide information to parents in relation to the entitlements of
children with special educational needs in <a shape="rect" href="../primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_primary_school/special_needs_education_primary_schools.html">primary</a>
and <a shape="rect" href="../primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_post_primary_school/post_primary_education_for_students_with_special_needs.html">second-level</a>
schools. The NCSE employs Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) who are
responsible for allocating additional teaching and other resources to support
the special educational needs of children with disabilities at local level.
SENOs are the point of contact for parents/guardians and schools.</p>

<h3>National Educational Psychological Service</h3>

<p>The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides an <a shape="rect" href="../primary_and_post_primary_educational_supports/national_educational_psychological_service.html">educational
psychology service</a> to primary and post-primary schools. NEPS psychologists
specialise in working with teachers, parents and children in identifying
educational needs and providing a consultation service for teachers and
parents. Children are normally referred to NEPS through the school principal
and parents should discuss any concerns regarding learning difficulties with
school personnel.</p>

<h3>Young parents programmes</h3>

<p>The Department of Health produced a report on <a shape="rect" href="http://www.omc.gov.ie/documents/publications/The_Invisible_Student_-_Young_Parents_in_Education.pdf">young
parents in education (pdf)</a> as part of its support of the Teen Parents
Support Programme. This report details the programmes available to support
parents who want to continue their own education or training.<br>
The financial support offered through the social welfare system can play a
major role in a young parent’s decision to return to or continue education or
training. The <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">Back
to Education Allowance (BTEA)</a> is administered by the Department of Social
Protection as part of the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/back_to_education/back_to_education_programme.html">Back
to Education Programme.</a> It allows people to return to full-time or
part-time education while continuing to get income support.</p>

<p>Early school-leavers programmes such as the <a href="http://www.tusla.ie/services/educational-welfare-services/school-support-services-under-the-deis-initiative/school-completion-programme/">Schools
Completion Programme</a>, the <a href="../returning_to_education/vocational_training_opportunities_scheme.html">Vocational
Training Opportunities Scheme</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../vocational_education_and_training/training_and_apprentiship_programmes/youthreach.html">Youthreach</a>
and <a shape="rect" href="../vocational_education_and_training/training_and_apprentiship_programmes/post_leaving_certificate_courses.html">Post
Leaving Certificate courses</a> are aimed at increasing the number of young
people staying in second-level schools or helping people get access to
second-chance or alternative education.</p>

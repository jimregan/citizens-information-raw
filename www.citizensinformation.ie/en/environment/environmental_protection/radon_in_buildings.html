<p>Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that results from the decay
of uranium in rocks and soils. The gas is colourless, odourless and tasteless
and can only be measured using special equipment. </p>

<p>When radon surfaces in the open air, it is quickly diluted to harmless
concentrations, but when it enters an enclosed space, such as a house or other
building, it can sometimes build up to unacceptably high concentrations. Radon
from the ground enters buildings chiefly through cracks in floors or gaps
around pipes or cables. </p>

<p>Radon decays to form tiny radioactive particles, some of which stay
suspended in the air. When these particles are inhaled into the lungs, they
give a radiation dose that may damage cells in the lung. </p>

<p>Radon has been shown to be a cause of cancer, specifically lung cancer;
prolonged exposure to elevated levels of radon gas in an enclosed area can be a
contributory factor in increasing the risk of lung cancer, particularly where
other factors such as cigarette smoking are involved. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l51fd8">EPA Office of Radiological Protection</h2>

<p>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) merged with the
Environmental Protection Agency on 1 August 2014 to become a fifth office in
the EPA structure called the <a href="http://www.epa.ie/radiation/">Office of
Radiological Protection</a>. This Office has regulatory, monitoring and
advisory responsibilities in matters relating to ionising radiation. It
assesses radon levels and has identified those areas where high indoor radon
levels are more likely to be found.</p>

<p>The EPA publishes an <a shape="rect" href="http://www.epa.ie/radiation/radonmap/">interactive radon map</a>. You can
enter an address to see if it is in a 'High Radon Area'. You can also view a
table that summarises the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.epa.ie/radiation/radon/awareness/results/">results of the
radon survey for each county</a> since the early 1990s. </p>

<p>The EPA's <a shape="rect" href="http://www.epa.ie/pubs/reports/radiation/radonhomesbrochure.html">Radon
in Homes booklet</a> gives information about radon and the harm it can do, and
describes how you can reduce your exposure to radon levels in the home. You can
also view <a shape="rect" href="http://www.epa.ie/radiation/radon/faqradon/">frequently asked
questions</a> about radon or use the <a href="http://www.epa.ie/about/contactus/query/">queries form</a> for other
questions. There is also a series of <a href="http://www.epa.ie/radiation/radexp/underrad/">radon factsheets on
epa.ie</a> and a <a href="http://www.epa.ie/radiation/radon/home/">video on
testing your home for radon</a>. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="le891a">Measuring radon levels</h2>

<p>The EPA recommends that all householders have their homes tested for radon.
It provides a <a href="http://www.epa.ie/radiation/meas/radon/services/apply/">radon measurement
service</a>, as do several private companies. Rates for different testers may
vary – the EPA charges about €56. </p>

<p>The testing is usually carried out by placing two small testing devices
(detectors) in the house for 3 months. At the end of this period, the detectors
are sent back to the testing laboratory for processing. This procedure is
carried out entirely by post. A 3-month measurement period is recommended
because radon levels in a house can vary considerably from day to day as a
result of changes in weather conditions, ventilation, building usage, etc. </p>

<p>The EPA's radon measurement service is confidential and it will not release
the result of any measurement to anyone other than the person who originally
requested the measurement.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l16650">If you find high radon levels</h2>

<p>The level of radon is measured in becquerels per cubic metre – expressed
as Bq/m<sup>3</sup> – and the national ‘reference level’ is 200
Bq/m<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>The EPA recommends that you should <a href="http://www.epa.ie/radiation/radon/fix/">consider taking action to reduce
the level of radon in your home</a> if the measurement is above this national
reference level. Steps that are taken to reduce the radon level are generally
known as ‘radon remediation’.</p>

<p>There are two main methods of radon remediation – either by preventing
radon entering your home from the ground underneath or by removing the radon
after it has entered your home. No matter which method you choose, it is
important to have your home re-tested after the work has been completed, to
ensure that it has been successful in reducing the level in your home to below
200 Bq/m<sup>3</sup>. The EPA provides a free post-remediation service to
homeowners.</p>

<p>Radon remediation works may qualify for the <a href="../../housing/housing_grants_and_schemes/home_renovation_incentive.html">Home
Renovation Incentive</a> scheme.</p>

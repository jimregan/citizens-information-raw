<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The legal definition of 'litter' extends from small bits of paper or
cigarette ends to anything (whether large or small) that is, or is likely to
become, unsightly. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0012/index.html">Litter
Pollution Act 1997</a> provides for penalties for people who litter. </p>

<p>Local authorities are responsible for keeping public places that are under
their control, including public roads, clear of litter as far as is practicably
possible. This includes arranging cleansing programmes, as well as providing
and emptying litter bins. They can take enforcement action against people who
break or ignore the law. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.garda.ie">Gardaí</a> also have the power to issue on-the-spot
fines for litter offences. </p>

<p>Each local authority must prepare a litter management plan for its area,
setting out its objectives to prevent and control litter, along with measures
to encourage public awareness of litter. The plan must also set out measures
and arrangements by which the local authority intends to achieve these
objectives. In preparing its litter management plan, the authority must consult
with local community and voluntary interests.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/Waste/LitterPollution/NationalLitterMonitoringSystem/">National
Litter Monitoring System</a> collates litter pollution surveys carried out by
local authorities and measures the changes over time. Litter control is an
important element of the <a href="the_tidy_towns_competition.html">Tidy
Towns</a> competition. <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/Waste/LitterPollution/LocalAuthorityGrantScheme/">Local
authority grants are available</a> for anti-litter and anti-graffiti awareness
projects.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Fines for littering</h3>

<p>Leaving or throwing litter in a public place is an offence that can be
subject to an on-the-spot fine of €150, or a maximum fine of €3,000 if you
are convicted in the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a>. Where an
offence continues after conviction, the person concerned is guilty of a further
offence and liable to a fine not exceeding €600 for each day during which the
contravention continues. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0027/index.html">Protection
of the Environment Act 2003</a> introduced conviction on indictment and carries
a maximum fine not exceeding €130,000 and a fine not exceeding €10,000 per
day for continuing offences.</p>

<p>On-the-spot fines can be issued by a litter warden appointed by the local
authority or by a Garda. If you are convicted of a litter offence, the court
may also require you to pay the local authority's costs and expenses in
investigating the offence and any costs incurred in bringing the prosecution.
</p>

<h3>Litter and public places</h3>

<p>If you either own or are responsible for a place to which the public has
access, for example, a school campus, public park, train or bus station or the
precincts of a shopping centre, you are obliged by law to keep the place
litter-free, regardless of how the litter got there. </p>

<h3>Litter and private property</h3>

<p>If you are the owner or occupier of property, any outdoor area on your
property that is visible from a public place must be kept free of litter.
Failure to do this can result in a fine or prosecution by your local authority.
</p>

<h3>Litter blackspots</h3>

<p>Where litter has accumulated on property for any reason and is visible from
a public place, the local authority can issue a notice to the owner or occupier
requiring its prompt removal. Such a notice can also set down precautionary
measures to be taken to prevent a reoccurrence. If the owner or occupier does
not fully comply with the notice, the local authority can do whatever is
necessary itself and require the owner or occupier to pay all of the costs
involved. </p>

<h3>Litter control at major events</h3>

<p>The promoters or organisers of major events, such as football matches, music
festivals etc., are required to ensure that litter control measures are in
place at the venue and in the surrounding vicinity before, during and after the
event. The local authority can undertake this task but the promoter or
organiser must bear the costs involved. </p>

<h3>Mobile food outlets</h3>

<p>Operators of mobile food outlets selling fast food or beverages, or other
outlets such as those selling farm produce, must provide suitable litter bins
in the vicinity of their outlets. They must also clean up any litter arising
from the outlet’s operation within a radius of 100 metres. </p>

<h3>Illegal dumping</h3>

<p>If you are aware of illegal dumping, you can report it to the local
authority, so that it can investigate and take any necessary enforcement
action. Alternatively, you can report it to the 24-hour National Environmental
Complaints Line – see ‘Where to apply’ below. Details of the complaint
will be passed to the local authority, the Garda Síochána or the
Environmental Protection Agency, as appropriate.</p>

<p>Read <a href="http://www.epa.ie/enforcement/report/#.VIhHB4lybhl">more about
making an environmental complaint</a>.</p>

<p>If a local authority can establish who owns material that has been illegally
dumped, the owner has a case to answer, even if they haven’t been caught in
the act of dumping. In addition, local authorities can require a householder or
business operator to indicate how and where they are disposing of their waste.
This can be relevant if the person does not use a refuse collection service or
bring their waste to an authorised disposal facility.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Dog fouling</h3>

<p>Dog owners must remove their pets' waste from public places and dispose of
it in a proper manner. This obligation applies to the following places:</p>
<ul><li>Public roads and footpaths </li>
  <li>Areas around shopping centres </li>
  <li>School/sports grounds </li>
  <li>Beaches </li>
  <li>The immediate area surrounding another person's house. </li>
</ul><p>Read more about the responsibilities of dog owners in our document on <a shape="rect" href="../animal_welfare_and_control/control_of_dogs.html">control
of dogs</a>. </p>

<h3>Posters and signs</h3>

<p>It is illegal to put up posters or signs on poles or other structures in
public places, unless you have the written permission of the owner of the pole
or other structure before you put them up. Any article or advertisement must
carry the name and address of the person: </p>
<ul><li>Who is promoting or arranging the meeting or event being advertised, or
  </li>
  <li>In any other case, on whose behalf the article or advertisement is being
    exhibited </li>
</ul><p>Following an election, a party or candidate must remove posters within 7
days. If they are not removed within this period, the local authority will
remove them and issue an on-the-spot fine of €150 in respect of each offence.
If a party or candidate has been issued with a fine and refuses to pay, they
can be prosecuted. The maximum penalty on summary conviction for non-payment of
the fine is €3,000.</p>

about the rules on election posters</a>.</p>

<h3>Advertising flyers</h3>

<p>If you plan to distribute advertising leaflets in the street, you should
first check with the local authority to see if there are any local litter
restrictions. It is illegal to place advertising leaflets on car windscreens.
</p>

<h3>Presenting your refuse for collection</h3>

<p>Refuse should be placed in a wheelie-bin or other sturdy refuse bin for
collection, or else in strong plastic bags. It should not be left out too long
before the collection is due, as it may attract birds or animals and create
litter.</p>

<p>It is an offence to dispose of your household refuse in street litter bins.
If you do this, you face prosecution by the local authority.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral, made up of long thin fibres,
which can be dangerous if they are inhaled as dust. They contribute to
increased risk of lung cancer, asbestosis (scarring of the lung tissue) and
mesothelioma (cancer of the lining of the chest and the lining of the abdominal
cavity).</p>

<p>Up until 1999, asbestos was commonly used in building materials, mainly for
insulation and fireproofing, and in some consumer goods. However, under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/si/0220.html">European Communities
(Dangerous Substances and Preparations) (Marketing and Use) Regulations
2003</a>, it is now illegal to place asbestos or asbestos-containing products
on the market. So, if you are removing a roof, for example, that contains
asbestos, the material must go for disposal and cannot be re-used or adapted
for re-use.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l4de75">If asbestos is present </h2>

<p>If you think that a material may contain asbestos, or if you are arranging
to have building work done on your home, you should get expert advice from a
specialist asbestos monitoring/surveying company, to identify whether asbestos
is present and assess the potential risk for fibres to be released and become
airborne. You should never handle, disturb or remove asbestos-containing
materials (ACMs) yourself.</p>

<p>Asbestos-containing material does not always have to be removed and disposed
of as waste. On occasion, it can be safer to maintain it rather than disturbing
the ACM by removing it. This decision should be based on a risk assessment
evaluation, carried out by a specialist.</p>

<p>If ACM is to be repaired and maintained, this must be done safely. Any
remaining material should be clearly labelled for asbestos and its location
should be clearly marked on the plans of the building for future reference.</p>

<p>Removing asbestos-containing material is a complex procedure and must only
be done by a specialist contractor. Asbestos waste is hazardous and improper
removal increases the risk of fibre inhalation. There are detailed rules about
how the waste should be wrapped, labelled and disposed of.</p>

more</a> on the website of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and in <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Publications_and_Forms/Publications/Chemical_and_Hazardous_Substances/asbestos_guidelines.pdf">these

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l37369">Protection of workers</h2>

<p>A series of <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Your_Industry/Chemicals/Legislation_Enforcement/Asbestos/Legislation/">Regulations</a>
have been made to ensure that workers are protected from risks related to
exposure to asbestos at work. They apply to all places of work and all sectors
of work where asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) may be present, and to
everyone who may be at risk from exposure when at work.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/">Health and Safety Authority (HSA)</a>
plays a major role in enforcing these regulations. While the HSA deals
specifically with worker protection and the industrial sector, if you are
having work done in your home then it can be deemed a workplace for that
purpose, and people who are working at the site must get the required level of
protection for them to do their work safely, without risk to their safety or
health.</p>

<p>The legally defined exposure limit value is 0.1 fibres /cm3 for all types of
asbestos. This is the maximum permissible concentration of asbestos fibres in
the air at the workplace to which workers may be exposed. If a planned
asbestos–related work activity could expose workers to a higher concentration
of asbestos fibres in air, the employer must submit a written notification to
the HSA 14 days before starting any work.</p>

<p>Employers who are responsible for people working in an environment with
possible ACMs must act to protect their employees’ health. The steps to be
taken include:</p>
<ul><li>Identify any ACMs before work begins and plan the work to disturb them as
    little as possible</li>
  <li>Prepare a written risk assessment and a written plan of work or method
    statement</li>
  <li>Tell employees the results of any measurement of asbestos dust in the air
    in their work area</li>
  <li>Prevent employees' exposure to asbestos or do everything possible to keep
    the amount of asbestos in the air to a minimum</li>
  <li>Use specialist contractors for any work that involves significant risk of
    exposure – such specialists must use suitable controls, such as dust
    extractors and decontamination units</li>
  <li>Provide appropriate protective gear for the type of work and the level of
    asbestos in the air</li>
  <li>Provide information, instruction and training, so that employees know
    what risks are involved and what precautions they should take</li>
  <li>Properly dispose of any waste that contains asbestos</li>
</ul><p>There is detailed information and advice in the HSA’s <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Publications_and_Forms/Publications/Chemical_and_Hazardous_Substances/asbestos_guidelines.pdf">practical
guidelines (pdf)</a> on the management and containment of ACMs in workplaces.
The HSA has also published an <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Publications_and_Forms/Publications/Chemical_and_Hazardous_Substances/Asbestos_Information_Sheet.html">Asbestos
Information Sheet</a>, aimed at employees and safety representatives, as well
as employers.</p>

<p>The HSA has the power to inspect sites where work with asbestos is being
carried out and its inspectors can call on a site without giving notice. They
must be given full access to all areas of that site to ensure that the
regulations are being complied with.</p>

<p>The HSA’s inspectors can close down a site immediately if they have reason
to believe that dangerous practices are in place. They can place a prohibition
notice on the site or specific operation. This notice remains effective until
the reason for issuing it has been rectified or remediated.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="leb891">Breaches of the law</h2>

<p>If you fail to act positively and fully regarding corrective action and the
requirements set down in a prohibition notice, then the HSA can prosecute. If
you are convicted of an offence under the Asbestos Regulations, the court can
impose a fine. It can also order you to take the necessary steps to remedy the
situation within a specific time. Failure to do this is an offence.</p>

<p>Local authorities are responsible for investigating incidents of air and
water pollution, which would include incorrect disposal of asbestos. They can
prosecute infringements of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1987/en/act/pub/0006/index.html">Air
Pollution Act 1987</a> and the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1977/en/act/pub/0001/index.html">Local
Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977</a>. Anyone who is found to be in breach
of this legislation is guilty of an offence.</p>

<p>You can find lists of asbestos specialists and contractors on the websites
of the <a href="http://www.epa.ie">Environmental Protection Agency</a>, the <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/">Health and Safety Authority</a> and some other
organisations mentioned in this document.</p>

<p>To make sure that a waste collection company is licensed to handle asbestos
waste, check with the <a href="http://www.nwcpo.ie/">National Waste Collection
Permit Office</a>.</p>

<p>If your concerns relate to a workplace and/or work activity, contact the
Health and Safety Authority.</p>

<p>If you have concerns about asbestos in public areas, contact the
Environmental Health Officer in your <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local

<p>Contact the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/Building-Works/Remediation-Programmes/">Department
of Education and Skills</a> with any concerns about the presence of asbestos in
schools.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.opw.ie/en/">Office of Public Works</a> is
responsible for <a href="http://www.opw.ie/en/asbestos/">dealing with
asbestos</a> in other buildings in the State's property portfolio.</p>

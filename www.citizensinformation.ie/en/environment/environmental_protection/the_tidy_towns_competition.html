<p>The national Tidy Towns competition is organised by the Department of Arts,
Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. It involves participating
towns being rated on all aspects of their local environment. It has been
running since 1958 and each year attracts more than 700 communities who compete
for a cash award and the title of Ireland's Tidiest Town. </p>

<p>The Tidy Towns competition is launched each year in March/April. Judging
takes place in June, July and August each year and the results are announced at
the National Awards Ceremony in September. </p>

<h3>Who can enter?</h3>

<p>Entry into the Tidy Towns competition is voluntary and the competition is
open to every village, town and city area in the State. The competition is for
local communities who are interested in improving the quality of their
surroundings and, in the process, developing community spirit. In general,
entries are voluntary committees that identify the work that needs to be done
and carry it out in co-operation with other local interests (for example, local
authorities, businesses, residents' associations and volunteers). </p>

<h3>Awards</h3>

<p>The town that has been judged the overall winner in the competition is named
Ireland's Tidiest Town and wins a cash prize, together with a perpetual trophy
and plaque. The award is made to the committee and is usually used to help fund
the committee's activities the following year. The overall winner is selected
from the winners of the 4 categories: Village, Small Town, Large Town, and
Large Urban Centre. There is a cash prize in each of these categories and a
perpetual trophy. While an area may not score highly enough to win these
awards, it can still win a special prize for particular projects undertaken in
the community. </p>

<h3>How the competition is marked</h3>

<p>Participants are assessed under 8 criteria with a total of 450 marks as
follows:</p>
<ul><li>Community involvement and planning (60 marks)</li>
  <li>Built environment and streetscape (50 marks) </li>
  <li>Landscaping and open spaces (50 marks) </li>
  <li>Wildlife, habitats and natural amenities (50 marks) </li>
  <li>Tidiness and litter control (90 marks) </li>
  <li>Sustainable waste and resource management (50 marks) </li>
  <li>Residential streets and housing areas (50 marks) </li>
  <li>Approach roads, streets and lanes (50 marks) </li>
</ul><p>These criteria are deliberately broad and incorporate everything from the
historical and cultural uniqueness of the location to the conservation of
natural amenities and wildlife areas. Participants can identify sub-areas for
judges to look at but judges assess the full area of the town or village. Where
boundaries are not clear (for example in urban areas) judges generally assess a
one-kilometre area in all directions from the centre. </p>

<h2>Environmental Impact Assessment</h2>


<p>The Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (<a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31997L0011:EN:HTML">Council
Directive 85/337/EEC as amended by Directive 97/11/EC</a> and <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32003L0035">2003/35/EC</a>
on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the
environment) requires member states of the EU to carry out assessments of the
environmental impact of certain public and private projects before they are
allowed to go ahead. The Directive is implemented in Ireland by the Planning
and Development Acts, the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 to 2002 and
the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations
1989-2006. </p>

<p>The aim of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process is to ensure
that projects which are likely to have a significant effect on the environment
are assessed in advance so that people are aware of what those effects are
likely to be. The assessment must be carried out in certain cases. For example,
motorways, large scale developments in agriculture, the food industry, chemical
industry, infrastructure and urban developments all require an EIA. When
submitting a planning application for such a development, the applicant must
also submit an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The regulations set
thresholds above which an EIA required. </p>

<p>The local authority (or An Bord Pleanála) may require that an EIS be
prepared, even if the development is below the threshold but if it is likely to
have a significant effect on the environment. The full list of projects and
threshold limits are set out in the Planning and Development Regulations.</p>

<p>The EIS is drawn up by the developer and must contain an analysis of the
likely effects (good and bad), of a proposed development on the environment,
including on people, flora, fauna, soil, water, air, landscape and cultural
heritage. It sets out how the developer proposes to deal with the bad effects.
The EIS must include a non-technical summary. The Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) has published <a href="http://www.epa.ie/downloads/advice/ea/guidelines/EPA_Guidelines_EIS_2002.pdf">Guidelines
on the information to be contained in an Environmental Impact Statement
(pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>It is not possible to get outline planning permission for developments
covered by the EIA. The notices about the application for planning permission
must include the fact that an EIS is available and the local authority’s
weekly list of planning applications must identify those applications involving
an EIS. </p>

<p>You may get a copy of any EIS used in a planning application from the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local
authority</a> or An Bord Pleanála. You may comment on an EIS in the same way
as you may comment on any other aspect of a planning application. </p>

<h3>EIA and the licensing system
</h3>

<p>If the planning application for the development in question must have an EIS
attached, then the EIS must also be included in the application for a licence
from the EPA. The local authority must notify the EPA of any planning
application involving a development which needs an Integrated Pollution Control
(IPC) licence. The EPA then has 5 weeks in which to comment on the application.
If the local authority decides to give planning permission for such a
development, it cannot impose conditions relating to the control of emissions.
This is for the EPA. It can, however, refuse permission on environmental
grounds (even if the EPA is prepared to grant a licence). </p>

<h2>Strategic Environmental Assessment</h2>

<p>Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is the process by which
environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the
preparation of plans and programmes and prior to their final adoption. The EU
Directive on Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) applies to a number of
sectors including agriculture, forestry, fisheries, energy, industry,
transport, waste management, water management, telecommunications, tourism and
land use planning. SEA means that plans and programmes must be assessed for
their environmental effect before they are adopted. </p>

<p>The SEA Directive (2001/42/EC) is implemented in Ireland by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/si/0435.html">European Communities
(Environmental Assessment of Certain Plans and Programmes) Regulations 2004</a>
(SI 435/2004) and the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/si/0436.html">Planning and
Development (Strategic Environmental Assessment) Regulations 2004</a> (SI 436/
2004) as amended by SI 200/2011 and SI 201/2011.</p>

<p>The above pieces of legislation implement the following aspects of the SEA
Directive: </p>
<ul><li>The review, preparation and variation of a development plan </li>
  <li>The preparation or amendment of a local area plan </li>
  <li>The review or making of regional planning guidelines </li>
  <li>The making of a planning scheme in respect of part or all of a Strategic
    Development Zone (SDZ).<br></li>

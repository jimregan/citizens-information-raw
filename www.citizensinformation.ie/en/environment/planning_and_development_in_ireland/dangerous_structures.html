<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Each local authority is responsible for dealing with dangerous places and
structures in its area. Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1964/en/act/pub/0029/index.html">Local
Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964</a>, local authorities can require an
owner to make such a site safe. In emergency cases, the local authority has the
power to enter the site itself and make it safe.</p>

<p>The Act allows local authorities to prosecute owners who do not comply with
notices served; to purchase land compulsorily; and to carry out necessary work
themselves and charge the owners for the cost.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l97d8f">Definitions</h2>

<p>The Act defines a <em>dangerous structure</em> as:</p>
<ul><li>Any building, wall or other structure of any kind, or</li>
  <li>Any part of, or anything attached to, a building, wall or other structure
    of any kind </li>
</ul><p>that, in the opinion of the local authority “is or is likely to be
dangerous to any person or property”</p>

<p>The Act also deals with dangerous places. It defines a <em>dangerous
place</em> as “an excavation, quarry, pit, well, reservoir, pond, stream,
dam, bank, dump, shaft or land” that, in the opinion of the local authority,
“is or is likely to be dangerous to any person”.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you own property that becomes dangerous, or contains any dangerous
structures, you must take steps to remedy the situation.</p>

<p>If a local authority considers that a structure is dangerous, it can, if
necessary, direct the owner to carry out work on the structure immediately in
order to make it safe. This can include demolition of the structure and
clearing and fencing of the site. If you are the owner and you do not comply
with such an instruction, you are guilty of an offence and will be liable to
pay a fine.</p>

<p>If necessary, the local authority can carry out this work itself. It must
notify the owner about what it intends to do.</p>

<p>It may also require that all use of the dangerous structure be stopped. In
certain cases, it can direct the occupier of a dangerous structure to leave and
remove all their property. If necessary, it can get a court order, which allows
it to use whatever force it considers necessary to remove the person and their
property from the dangerous structure.</p>

<p>It is up to the local authority to decide if it should provide other
accommodation or give money to a person who has been forced to leave their
dwelling in this way. This may depend on whether the person carried on any
trade or business in the dangerous structure or if the local authority
considers that the person will suffer real hardship because of having to
leave.</p>

<h3>Statutory notices</h3>

<p>If you are the owner or occupier of a dangerous place or structure, you are
likely to receive a statutory notice from the local authority, informing you
that your property has been classed as dangerous and tell you what the local
authority requires you to do (or plans to do itself) in order to make it
safe.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, a local authority may decide to purchase a dangerous
place or structure compulsorily.</p>

<p>You have the right to respond to any notice that the local authority sends
you and to make an objection to the compulsory purchase of a site.</p>

<h3>Compulsory purchase</h3>

<p>A local authority can buy dangerous land in its area (including land that is
no longer dangerous because the local authority has carried out work on it),
either by agreement with the owner or by compulsory purchase. It must advertise
the details of any proposed compulsory purchase in the local newspaper and send
a notice to the owner or occupier of the land, giving information about how and
where to object to the purchase.</p>

<p>In the case of a dangerous place, a notice must be posted either on or near
the land, giving details of the local authority's intentions.</p>

<p>If an objection is made, the local authority cannot buy the land without the
consent  of <a href="../../housing/planning_permission/an_bord_pleanala.html">An Bord
Pleanála</a>. If An Bord Pleanála approves the compulsory purchase and the
local authority has dealt with any objections received, the local authority can
buy the land, using a vesting order.</p>

<h3>Compensation</h3>

<p>If you have any right to or interest in land that has been compulsorily
acquired by a local authority, you can apply to it for compensation within 12
months of the vesting. The local authority will then pay you an amount equal to
the value (if any) of the land. The value of the land will be negotiated under
the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1919/en/act/pub/0057/print.html">Acquisition
of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act 1919</a>. If there is any money due to
the local authority on the property (in the form of a derelict sites levy or a
court order for payment), the local authority can subtract this from the
compensation. If the amount owed on the property is more that the compensation
that has been agreed, no compensation will be paid.</p>

<h3>Offences</h3>

<p>Under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964, it is an offence
to:</p>
<ul><li>Obstruct a local authority that is carrying out its duty under the
  Act.</li>
  <li>Obstruct anyone attempting to comply with the Act.</li>
  <li>Fail to carry out the measures required by the local authority to prevent
    a structure or place from being classed as dangerous within an allotted
    time.</li>
  <li>Fail to comply with an order of the District Court under the Act</li>
</ul><p>On summary conviction for these offences: a fine not exceeding €2,500.</p>

<p>It is also an offence to:</p>
<ul><li>Fail to give information or knowingly give wrong information to the local
    authority about the ownership of a dangerous structure.</li>
  <li>Obstruct an authorised officer of the local authority while he or she is
    exercising a power conferred by the Act</li>
</ul><p>On summary conviction for these offences: a fine not exceeding €2,500.</p>

<h3>Fines</h3>

<p>Fines are payable to the local authority for non-compliance with statutory
notices about dangerous structures – see ‘Offences’ above.</p>

<h3>Cost of work</h3>

<p>The local authority can recover the cost of necessary work on dangerous
places and structures from the owners.</p>

<h3>Derelict sites levy</h3>

<p>The derelict sites levy is also payable to the local authority if the site
is entered into the <a href="copy_of_derelict_sites_and_dangerous_structures.html">Derelict Sites
Register</a>. This levy amounts to 3% of the market value of the land
concerned. The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government may
prescribe a higher percentage, which cannot be more than 10% of the market
value.</p>

<div class="topic">

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Each local authority is responsible for dealing with derelict sites in its
area. Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0014/index.html">Derelict
Sites Act 1990</a>, local authorities can force owners to clean up these sites.
The Act allows local authorities to prosecute owners who do not comply with
notices served, to purchase land compulsorily; and to carry out necessary work
themselves and charge the owners for the cost. </p>

<p>Local authorities have similar powers as regards <a href="dangerous_structures.html">dangerous structures</a>.</p>

<h3>Vacant sites</h3>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/33/enacted/en/html">Urban
Regeneration and Housing Act 2015</a>, each local authority is also required to
compile a <em>vacant sites register</em>, starting from January 2017. This is a
register of lands in the local authority’s area that are suitable for housing
but are not coming forward for development. From January 2019 onwards, a vacant
site levy will be charged on such sites. There is <a href="http://www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/pl_07-2016_guidance_on_implementation_of_the_vacant_site_levy.pdf">detailed
guidance (pdf)</a> on housing.gov.ie. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l0b890">Definition</h2>

<p>The Derelict Sites Act defines a derelict site as any land that “detracts,
or is likely to detract, to a material degree from the amenity, character or
appearance of land in the neighbourhood of the land in question because
of”:</p>
<ul><li>Structures which are in a ruinous, derelict or dangerous condition,
  or</li>
  <li>The neglected, unsightly or objectionable condition of the land or of
    structures on it, or</li>
  <li>The presence, deposit or collection of litter, rubbish, debris or
  waste</li>
</ul><h3>Register of derelict sites </h3>

<p>Each local authority must keep a register of all derelict sites in its area,
containing the location of each derelict site, the name and address of the
owner and details of any action the local authority has taken about the site.
If the property is owned or occupied by a local authority itself, the register
must contain details of what it is being used for and what the local authority
intends to do with it.</p>

<p>The register must give details of the current market value of every site
listed on it. This valuation is done by the local authority, which can
authorise any qualified person to act on its behalf. The local authority enters
details of the valuation into the register and serves a notice on the site’s
owner – see ‘Statutory notices’ below.</p>

<p>If you are the owner, you have the right to <a href="http://www.valuationtribunal.ie/derelict-sites-appeals.asp">appeal the
valuation to the Valuation Tribunal</a> within 28 days of receiving the
notice.</p>

<p>The local authority must make the Derelict Sites Register available for
public inspection. It can remove an entry from the Register when it is
satisfied that the work that it has ordered has been carried out on the
derelict site.</p>

<h3>Derelict sites levy</h3>

<p>If you are the owner of <em>urban land</em> that has been entered into the
Derelict Sites Register, you must pay an annual levy to the local authority –
see ‘Rates’ below. The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local
Government can prescribe any area to be an <em>urban area</em>, as long as it
is not part of a county or other borough.</p>

<p>If you do not pay the derelict sites levy within 2 months of receiving the
demand and if you have not reached an agreement with the local authority,
interest will be charged on the full amount at a rate of 1.25% a month or part
of a month. The local authority can take you to court to recover this amount,
if necessary.</p>

<p>If the site is removed from the Derelict Sites Register, the local authority
will calculate the amount of levy that you owe, based on how many days are left
in the financial year. It will then issue either a refund or a demand for
payment.</p>

<p>Any change in the valuation of the land means that the amount of the
derelict sites levy on that land will also change. If the value is decreased,
the local authority will re-calculate the amount according to the new valuation
and refund any excess that you may have paid. If the value of the property is
increased, the local authority is entitled to demand the levy on the amount of
the increase.</p>

<p>If the local authority is satisfied that you have plans to develop the
property, and planning permission has been granted for this development, you
can enter into a bond instead of paying the derelict sites levy. This bond is a
guarantee that has been secured with a bank or insurance company, agreeing that
all derelict sites levies due on the property will be paid if the planned
scheme (or a similar scheme) is not carried out within 5 years.</p>

<p>If you are required to pay a vacant site levy under the Urban Regeneration
and Housing Act 2015, you will not also have to pay a derelict sites levy on
the same site.</p>

<h3>Statutory notices</h3>

<p>If you are the owner or occupier of a derelict site, you are likely to
receive several statutory notices from your local authority. The first is a
notice informing you that your property has been added to the Derelict Sites
Register. You will then get another notice to tell you what the local authority
wants you to do to clean up your site. In some circumstances, a local authority
may decide to purchase a derelict site compulsorily. You have the right to
respond to any notice that the local authority sends you and to make an
objection to the compulsory purchase of a site.</p>

<h3>Compulsory purchase</h3>

<p>The local authority can buy a derelict site in its area, either by agreement
with the owner or by compulsory purchase. It must advertise the details of any
proposed compulsory purchase in the local newspaper and send a notice to the
owner or occupier of the land, giving information about how and where to object
to the purchase. If an objection is made, the local authority cannot buy the
land without the consent of <a href="../../housing/planning_permission/an_bord_pleanala.html">An Bord
Pleanála</a>.</p>

<p>If An Bord Pleanála approves the compulsory purchase and the local
authority has dealt with any objections received, the local authority can buy
the land, using a vesting order. </p>

<h3>Compensation</h3>

<p>If you have any right to or interest in land that has been compulsorily
acquired by a local authority, you can apply to it for compensation within 12
months of the vesting. The local authority will then pay you an amount of
compensation equal to the value (if any) of the land. This value will be
negotiated under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1919/en/act/pub/0057/print.html">Acquisition
of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act 1919</a>. If there is any money due to
the local authority on the property (in the form of a derelict sites levy or a
court order for payment), the local authority can subtract this from the
compensation. If the amount that you owe on the property is more than the
agreed compensation, no compensation will be paid.</p>

<h3>Offences </h3>

<p>Under the Derelict Sites Act 1990, it is an offence to:</p>
<ul><li>Remove, damage or deface a notice posted by the local authority regarding
    a derelict site. </li>
  <li>Fail to carry out the measures required by the local authority to prevent
    a property from being classed as derelict within an allotted time. </li>
  <li>Fail to notify the local authority of the transfer of land or interest in
    land (other than by will or on an intestacy) from one person to another.
    Both parties must notify the local authority in writing within 4 weeks of
    the transfer. </li>
  <li>Fail to notify the local authority of the transfer of land or interest in
    land by will or on an intestacy. The new owner must notify the local
    authority in writing within 6 months and the representative of the person
    under whose will or upon whose intestacy the transfer occurred must notify
    the local authority in writing within 2 months. </li>
  <li>Prevent an authorised person from entering or carrying out authorised
    business on the derelict site. </li>
</ul><p>Anyone who commits an offence under this Act can be prosecuted by the local
authority.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<h3>Derelict sites levy</h3>

<p>The derelict sites levy amounts to 3% of the market value of the land
concerned. The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government
may prescribe a higher percentage, which cannot be more than 10% of the market
value.</p>

<h3>Fines</h3>

<p>Fines are payable to the local authority for non-compliance with statutory
notices about derelict sites and for failing to carry out work required by the
local authority. The rates of fine were set in the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0014/index.html">Derelict
Sites Act 1990</a> and have been increased in accordance with the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0008/index.html">Fines Act
2010</a>. Read <a href="../../justice/criminal_law/criminal_trial/maximum_fines_on_summary_conviction.html">more
about how fine rates are calculated</a>.</p>

<p><strong>On summary conviction</strong> for all offences: a fine not
exceeding €2,500, also a fine not exceeding €500 for every day on which the
offence continues and not exceeding €2,500, in total. (This figure does not
include the original fine of €2,500 for committing the offence in the first
place.) You could also be sentenced to imprisonment for up to 6 months. If the
court decides, you could be subject to both a fine and imprisonment.</p>

<p><strong>On conviction or indictment</strong> of failing to carry out the

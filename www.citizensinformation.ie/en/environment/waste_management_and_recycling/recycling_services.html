<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="lb57ea">Responsibilities and roles</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/Pages/home.aspx#">Department of
Communications, Climate Action and Environment</a> has overall responsibility
for recycling and waste management.</p>

<p>For non-hazardous waste, there are <a href="http://www.environ.ie/environment/waste/regional-waste-management-plans/regional-waste-management-plans">3
regions for the purposes of waste management planning: Southern,
Eastern-Midlands and Connacht-Ulster</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.epa.ie/#&amp;panel1-1">Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA)</a> and <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local
authorities</a> also have roles in this area. The EPA is responsible for the <a href="http://www.epa.ie/waste/hazardous/">National Hazardous Waste Management
Plan</a> and for ensuring that local authorities carry out their environmental
protection functions.</p>

<p>The local authorities are responsible for:</p>
<ul><li>Authorisation and control of commercial waste collection activities</li>
  <li>Authorisation of waste exports and monitoring of internal movements of
    hazardous wastes</li>
  <li>Waste permits for small-scale recovery and disposal activities</li>
  <li>Ensuring adequate waste collection, recovery and disposal arrangements in
    their areas</li>
  <li>Monitoring and inspection of waste activities generally</li>
</ul><p>They arrange for the provision of <a href="domestic_refuse.html">domestic
refuse services</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="domestic_recycling_services.html">recycling of domestic waste</a>, which
avoids sending waste to <a href="landfill_sites.html">landfill</a>. </p>

<p>Both the EPA and local authorities have to keep registers detailing a wide
range of their activities in the area of waste management. The public can
inspect these registers free of charge.</p>

<p><a href="waste_from_electric_and_electronic_equipment.html">Waste from
Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)</a> is the responsibility of
retailers and local authorities, who facilitate the <a href="recycling_waste_from_electrical_and_electronic_equipment.html">recycling
of WEEE</a>. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="ldb9ad">Disposing of waste</h2>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/si/430/made/en/print">European
Union (Household Food Waste and Bio-waste) Regulations 2015</a>, all
householders (except in very small population areas or on small islands) have
to do one of the following with their food waste:</p>
<ul><li>Segregate it and make it available for separate collection</li>
  <li><a href="composting_domestic_waste.html">Compost</a> it at home (while
    ensuring that it does not cause smells or nuisance)</li>
  <li>Bring it to an authorised facility for composting or other suitable
    treatment</li>
</ul><p>It is illegal to <a href="burning_household_waste.html">burn household or
garden waste</a> at home or in your garden.</p>

<p>There are specific regulations that cover <a href="../../travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/buying_or_selling_a_vehicle/how_to_dispose_of_an_end_of_life_vehicle.html">disposing
of an end-of-life vehicle</a> as waste.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l23f7d">Further information</h2>

<p>There is an <a href="plastic_bag_environmental_levy.html">environmental
levy on plastic shopping bags</a>. Retailers must pass on the full amount of
the levy as a charge to customers at the checkout. Revenue generated from the
levy goes into the Environmental Fund to support waste management, litter and
other environmental initiatives.</p>

<p><a href="tax_relief_on_domestic_service_charges.html">Tax relief on waste
charges</a> ended with effect from January 2012 and can no longer be claimed.

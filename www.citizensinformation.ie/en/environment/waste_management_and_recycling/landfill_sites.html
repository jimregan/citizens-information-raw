<p>Landfill is an important part of waste management in Ireland. However, all
other waste disposal options, like <a shape="rect" href="recycling_services.html">recycling</a>, minimisation, prevention and
re-use, must first be considered before the landfill option. </p>

<p>A modern landfill is a carefully designed structure built into or on top of
the ground in which waste is isolated from the surrounding environment
(groundwater, air, soil). It offers much more protection for the environment
and for local people than traditional dumps did. Problems with odours, litter,
vermin, etc., are greatly reduced by the careful management of the site. Most
landfills are made up of the following elements:</p>
<ul><li>Bottom liner system - this separates waste and leachate (liquid that
    gathers at the bottom of the waste mass) from the ground and groundwater
  </li>
  <li>Cells (old and new) - where the waste is stored within the landfill </li>
  <li>Storm water drainage system - this collects rain water that falls on the
    landfill </li>
  <li>Leachate collection system - this collects water that has percolated
    through the landfill itself and contains contaminating substances. The
    leachate should be treated and disposed of in a safe way. </li>
  <li>Gas collection system - pipes collect the methane, carbon dioxide and
    sulphur dioxide gases that are formed during the biological breakdown of
    waste. Where possible, these gases are used for the production of
    electricity. </li>
  <li>Covering or cap - this seals off the top of the landfill with a gas
    drainage layer, an impermeable mineral layer, a drainage layer of at least
    0.5 metre and at least one metre of top soil. </li>
</ul><p>Before a landfill site can be built, an Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) is done on the proposed site. </p>

<h3>Monitoring of landfill sites</h3>

<p>Landfill sites are licensed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and
must be monitored on a regular basis to make sure they are being run
efficiently and safely. The responsibility for this monitoring rests with the
EPA and landfill operators. This process begins with the application for a
waste licence. If a landfill site operator breaks the terms of its licence by
failing to establish proper monitoring procedures or failing to send its
monitoring data to the EPA, the Agency can prosecute under the Waste Management
Acts 1996 - 2008. </p>

<p>While the EPA carries out routine inspections on landfill sites and provides
guidance for landfill operators, the operators themselves are required to
constantly monitor various aspects of their site to ensure they remain in
compliance with their licence. </p>

<p>As well as these technical monitoring practices, the management of a
landfill site must include proper compacting of waste, covering waste with a
layer of soil, litter control, surface water control and general tidiness. </p>

<p>The EPA has set out recommendations in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.epa.ie/downloads/advice/waste/waste/">landfill manuals</a>.
</p>

<p>Each landfill site has the authority to refuse to accept any type of waste
prohibited by its waste licence. If you have a query about an item you want to
send to landfill, contact your local landfill site to see if it will accept it.
You can contact your local authority for further advice. </p>

<h3>Landfill operators</h3>

<p>All landfill sites must be licensed by the EPA and there is a detailed
application process for a licence. The EPA can prohibit a landfill from
accepting certain kinds of waste if it thinks the provisions set out in the
application are not sufficient to prevent the risk of environmental pollution.
</p>

<p>All new landfill sites must apply for planning permission from a local
authority or, in certain cases, directly to An Bord Pleanála. An Environmental
Impact Assessment is typically required as part of the planning process. This
assessment will also be passed onto the EPA as part of the application process.
</p>

<h3>Environmental Protection Agency</h3>

<p>All landfills require a licence from the EPA. The information contained in
any waste licence is available to the public. This includes the application
documentation. Anyone can make an objection to a licence application or a
decision by the EPA on granting a licence. After the EPA make the licence
application available, you must make your objection within 28 days. </p>

<p>The EPA must also prepare <a shape="rect" href="http://www.epa.ie/downloads/advice/waste/waste/">guidelines on the
selection, management, operation and termination of use of landfill sites</a>.
These guidelines aim to improve and standardise the practices in landfill sites
and bring them in line with European regulations. </p>

<p>The Waste Management Act (1996) provides for substantial penalties for
environmental offences. The EPA is responsible for dealing with any violations
of this Act by landfill operators that it has licensed. When the EPA discovers
these violations, it will first write to the landfill operator, telling them
what it needs to do to uphold the terms of its licence. All such
recommendations must be implemented as soon as possible. If this does not
succeed, it can bring summary proceedings against landfill operators in the
District Court for offences under the Waste Management Act. It can also bring
proceedings in the High Court. </p>

<p>Under the Waste Management Act, it is possible for anyone to take a landfill
operator to court. However, this practice is costly and time consuming. The EPA
deals with complaints from the public about landfill sites and will take
whatever actions it considers necessary to investigate and remedy the
situation. </p>

<p><strong>Office of Environmental Enforcement</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.epa.ie/about/org/oee/#.VIcbqERF2ic">Office of
Environmental Enforcement (OEE)</a>, which was established under the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), also has a mandate to deliver enhanced
environmental compliance through enforcement of EPA licences issued to waste,
industrial and other activities. It exercises a supervisory role in respect of
the environmental protection activities of local authorities. In this regard,
the OEE acts as a resource to members of the public who have exhausted all
other avenues of complaint.<br></p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Under the Waste Management (Landfill Levy) Regulations (2013), a Government
levy of €75 is payable per tonne of commercial waste disposed in landfill.
This levy is payable on top of whatever fee your local authority or the private
landfill owner charge for use of their site. Money from this levy goes towards
the Environmental Fund set up to provide finance for environmental projects.
</p>

<p>While the levy is standard in all landfill sites, gate fees vary from site
to site. General commercial waste is charged by weight. For more information
about prices, you check with your local authority or private landfill site. </p>

<p>For details about landfill sites in your area, you should apply to your
local authority. For information about the licensing and monitoring of landfill
sites or if you have any complaints about landfill sites in your area, you
should contact the EPA. </p>

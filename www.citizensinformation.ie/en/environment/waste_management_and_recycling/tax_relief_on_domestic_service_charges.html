<p>In the past, tax relief was available if you paid service charges to a local
authority or other provider of water, refuse or sewage services. The relief was
granted in each tax year in respect of charges due and paid in the previous
year. </p>

<p><strong>This tax relief has ended.</strong> You cannot claim tax relief on
service charges paid from 2011 onwards. </p>

<p>If you have not yet claimed for service charges paid in 2010 or previous
years, it is now too late to put in a claim, as this had to be done within 4
years of the end of the relevant tax year.</p>

<p>The charges that you paid for the following services qualified for tax
relief:</p>
<ul><li>Domestic refuse collection, domestic sewage disposal and domestic water
    supplies provided by your local authority </li>
  <li>Domestic water supplies provided by <a shape="rect" href="../water_services/water_supply.html">group water schemes</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="domestic_refuse.html">Domestic refuse
    collection</a> by independent contractors </li>
</ul></div>

<p>Composting is the breakdown of organic material such as kitchen or garden
waste by organisms that feed on waste and convert it into an earthlike mass.
This earthlike mass (compost) can then be used as a soil conditioner. </p>

<p>As part of Irish Government policy on waste management, targets were set to
reduce biodegradable waste consigned to <a shape="rect" href="landfill_sites.html">landfill</a>. <a shape="rect" href="recycling_services.html">Recycling</a> and composting of domestic waste
has been established as one way of reaching this target. </p>

<p>European Union (Household Food Waste and Bio -Waste) Regulations 2013 (<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/si/0071.html">S.I. No. 71 of
2013</a>) are designed to promote the segregation and recovery of household
food waste. The Regulations will be phased in over a period to 1 July 2016,
brown bins for composting will be rolled out to most towns and cities with only
very small population areas being exempt or small islands or areas where it is
simply not technically, environmentally or practical to separately collect such
waste.</p>

<p>Organic materials can also be brought to civic amenity centres to be
composted. You should contact your <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local
authority</a> for the details.</p>

<p>In addition to contributing to the recycling process, composting reduces the
volume of your weekly domestic waste and therefore will cut your domestic
refuse charges. <br></p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1e1f7">Home composting</h2>

<p>There are various forms of home composting - you can have a compost heap at
the end of your garden or you can make or buy your own compost container. It is
useful to remember that it is best to start a compost bin in the spring, summer
or autumn as the decomposition process slows or stops in winter. </p>

<p>If you are using a compost container, this container will protect the
contents from the elements. You can buy a compost container in most garden
centres and hardware shops. Some local authorities in Ireland have schemes in
place that offer compost containers to households in your area for reduced
rates. </p>

<p>Before buying a container, you should take into consideration the size of
your garden and the number of people in your family or household. </p>

<p>It is useful to have a small container in your kitchen that collects your
organic waste for composting. This will reduce the number of trips to your
compost container. You will also need a garden shovel or fork for turning and
removing the compost. You can add activators to your compost bin to help
establish the bin or speed up the decomposition process, but these are not
necessary to compost successfully. </p>

you should not compost and the reasons why here</a>. </p>

<p>You do not need a compost container to begin to recycle your domestic waste
- you could have a compost heap at the end of your garden. </p>

<h3>Health and safety</h3>

<p>When deciding where to place your compost container, there are a few
guidelines to remember from a health and safety perspective,to ensure that you
are composting correctly: </p>
<ul><li>Place the composting bin on grass or earth: This allows worms to enter
    the bin from underneath. Worms will help keep air circulating through the
    material. Plenty of air is required to speed up the composting process and
    to avoid odours. As the material decomposes, moisture seeps out and you
    will need to allow this liquid to soak into your grass or earth. Bins with
    bases have holes to allow for worm entry and should be raised slightly off
    the ground (i.e., by 1-2cm.). You can achieve this by placing a few flat
    stones under the base. Bins with bases are raised slightly to prevent the
    holes becoming blocked, which would prevent worm and oxygen entry. </li>
  <li>Distance from the house: Place the bin not too far from the kitchen door.
    This allows you easy access to the bin but ensures the container is far
    enough away to avoid contamination. </li>
  <li>Place the container in a sunny spot: Containers made of dark colours will
    absorb light from the sun, without drying out the material in the
    container. </li>
  <li>Protect the container from heavy rain: Heavy rain can waterlog the
    container, preventing composting. When you have chosen the location, loosen
    the soil in order to help drainage and make it easier for the contents to
    degrade. </li>
</ul><p>Further information about home composting is available from the
Environmental Services section of your <a shape="rect" href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local
authority</a>. </p>

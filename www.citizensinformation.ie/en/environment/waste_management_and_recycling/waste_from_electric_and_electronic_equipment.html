<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Many everyday consumer items contain electrical parts. Waste Electrical and
Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is electrical and electronic equipment that is
broken or unwanted. Any appliance that runs on electricity has the potential to
cause damage to the environment if it is not disposed of in a responsible way.
<a href="http://www.weeeregister.ie/uploads/content/WEEE_Register_Society_Category_Listings_5_6a.pdf">Common
items of electrical and electronic waste</a> are:</p>
<ul><li>Large household appliances (refrigerators/freezers, washing machines,
    dishwashers) </li>
  <li>Small household appliances (toasters, coffee makers, irons, hairdryers)
  </li>
  <li>Information technology (IT) and telecommunications equipment (personal
    computers, telephones, mobile phones, laptops, printers, scanners,
    photocopiers) </li>
  <li>Consumer equipment (televisions, stereo equipment, electric toothbrushes)
  </li>
  <li>Lighting equipment (fluorescent lamps) </li>
  <li>Electrical and electronic tools (handheld drills, saws, screwdrivers)
  </li>
  <li>Toys, leisure and sports equipment</li>
  <li>Medical equipment systems (with the exception of all implanted and
    infected products) </li>
  <li>Monitoring and control instruments </li>
  <li>Automatic dispensers. </li>
</ul><h3>Environmental concerns </h3>

<p>The main environmental concerns are resource depletion and dangerous
substances arising from waste from electrical and electronic equipment. </p>

<p>If electrical and electronic products are disposed of in landfill sites,
millions of tonnes of materials that could be recovered and reused for new
products are being lost. Recovery of these materials would reduce the need to
extract more raw materials for the manufacture of new products. </p>

<p>Some electronic equipment and/or its components contain substances that are
considered dangerous to the environment and human health if they are disposed
of carelessly. Although these dangerous substances are usually only contained
in small amounts, they have great potential for causing serious environmental
damage. </p>

<h3>Disposing of WEEE</h3>

<h3>Landfill sites</h3>

<p>Landfill is the disposal of waste material by burying it. Space at landfill
sites is becoming scarce. It is not appropriate to dispose of waste from
electric and electronic equipment in landfill sites because of the harmful
substances that waste from electric and electronic equipment is known to
contain. </p>

<h3>Incinerators</h3>

<p>Incineration is the process of burning materials at high temperatures. </p>

<h3>Recycling of waste from electric and electronic equipment</h3>

<p>The recycling industry is complex. There are large shredder operators and
smaller specialist recyclers. They are backed up by other companies, which
provide services such as plastics recycling and refining precious metals. In
addition, there may be small repair and refurbishment initiatives. Recycling
companies also collect items for export to countries with more advanced
recycling systems and those that extract components and materials for
recycling.</p>

<p>Shredders process a mixed range of equipment to recover different materials,
primarily metals. Large hammermills, also known as fragmentisers, shred a mixed
stream of metal-rich materials, including end-of-life vehicles, household
appliances and other light iron.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The WEEE Directive requires producers to be responsible for the financing of
the collection, treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal of WEEE.
It means that final users of such household WEEE are entitled to leave that
waste back free of charge, either to retail outlets when buying a replacement
item, or to other authorised collection points, including local authority civic
amenity sites. WEEE includes <a href="http://www.weeeregister.ie/uploads/content/Battery_Categorisation.pdf">batteries
(pdf)</a> and accumulators.</p>

<h3>Legislation</h3>

<p>The first WEEE Directive (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32002L0096">Directive
2002/96/EC</a>) entered into force in February 2003. The Directive provided for
the creation of collection schemes where consumers return their WEEE free of
charge. In December 2008, the European Commission proposed to revise the
Directive in order to tackle the fast increasing waste stream. The new WEEE <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32012L0019">Directive
2012/19/EU</a> entered into force on 13 August 2012 and became effective on 14
February 2014.</p>

<h3>Local government management of waste from electric and electronic
equipment</h3>

<p>Local authorities have developed initiatives for improving their management
of waste from electric and electronic equipment as part of their general waste
management plans. These plans revolve around improved collection facilities at
civic amenity sites, increasing the amount of waste from electric and
electronic equipment that is recycled and cutting down on the amount of waste
from electric and electronic equipment sent to landfill sites. For details of
initiatives in your own area, you should contact <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">your
local authority</a>. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>As noted above, the WEEE Directive provides for free take-back of
end-of-life equipment. </p>

<p>Householders may also deposit WEEE free at civic amenity facilities. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0010/index.html">Waste
Management Act 1996</a>, all local authorities are obliged to collect or
arrange for the collection of the domestic waste in their area. They must also
provide or arrange for the provision of facilities for the disposal and
recovery of household waste. Household waste is usually collected once a week,
generally by a private operator. Some operators collect different types of
waste in different weeks.</p>

<p>You can reduce the amount of domestic waste you leave for collection – see
‘Recycling and composting’ below.</p>

<h3>Payment by weight</h3>

<p>Some waste collectors already charge for waste collection according to
weight but this option will be made available to all customers. By 1 January
2017, as well as showing the charges that currently apply, your bill will also
show the charges that would apply on a pay-by-weight basis. You can choose to
remain on your current pricing plan or you can change to payment by weight.
Prices will not be increased during the period June 2016 to the end of June
2017. There is an allowance under the pay-by-weight system so that there will
be no additional charge for the disposal of incontinence products supplied by
the HSE.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Food waste</h3>

<p>Since 2013, a series of Regulations have been introduced to deal with the
disposal of food waste and bio-waste. As part of this phased introduction,
brown bins have been introduced on a gradual basis, starting in the largest
population centres and extending each year to smaller centres of population.
Since 1 July 2015 the Regulations have been in effect for centres of population
with more than 1,500 residents.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/si/430/made/en/print">European
Union (Household Food Waste and Bio-waste) Regulations 2015</a> come into
effect for the last grouping of population centres – those with more than 500
residents – from 1 July 2016.</p>

<p>There will be some exceptions to the Regulations – for example, in very
small population areas or on small islands, where it is not practical to
collect food waste separately.</p>

<p>Under the Regulations, all householders will have to do one of the following
with their food waste:</p>
<ul><li>Segregate it and make it available for separate collection</li>
  <li>Compost it at home (while ensuring that it does not cause smells or
    nuisance)</li>
  <li>Bring it to an authorised facility for composting or other suitable
    treatment</li>
</ul><p>You may not use a macerator to process your food waste, or put food waste in
the general waste collection, which goes to landfill.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.environ.ie/environment/waste/food-waste/biofood-waste">Read
more on environ.ie</a>. There is further useful information on <a href="http://www.brownbin.ie/">brownbin.ie</a>, on <a href="http://www.stopfoodwaste.ie/">stopfoodwaste.ie</a> and on <a href="http://www.epa.ie/waste/householder/#.Vs8g0oncvhk">epa.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>Containers for waste</h3>

<p>Many waste collectors use wheelie bins for the safe and efficient collection
of waste. If there is a wheelie bin system in operation in your area, you must
present your waste in a wheelie bin or it will not be collected. If you use bin
bags, you will need to attach a pre-paid tag to each bag. If you do not tag
your rubbish, it will not be collected. You can generally buy tags from local
shops, garages etc. A full list of sellers is available from your waste
operator.</p>

<h3>Separation of waste</h3>

<p>Most waste collectors operate a system of waste separation. Different types
of waste must be put in colour-coded containers. Examples of such colour codes
are: brown bins for compost, green bins for recycling and black or grey bins
for residual waste, which goes to landfill. Your waste collector will provide
detailed information about what goes in each bin.</p>

<h3>Bulk waste</h3>

<p>If you have a large volume of waste to get rid of, you can hire a skip from
a private waste collection company. Bulky waste can also be brought to <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/Waste/WEEE/CivicAmenitySites/">civic
amenity centres</a> or <a shape="rect" href="landfill_sites.html">landfill
sites</a>. Some local authorities operate occasional bulk waste collections and
will advertise this service if and when it occurs. Bulky items like carpets,
furniture or fridges should never be left out for the regular refuse
collection. </p>

<h3>Recycling and composting</h3>

<p>Much of household waste can be recycled. Local authorities must ensure that
there are adequate facilities for recycling. Most waste operators collect
recyclables in designated bins on alternate weeks. Read more in <a href="domestic_recycling_services.html">our document on recycling domestic
waste</a>.</p>

<p>Composting is another useful way of cutting down on domestic waste. Read
more in <a href="composting_domestic_waste.html">our document on
composting</a>. </p>

<h3>Landfill</h3>

<p>Much of the domestic waste produced in Ireland is sent to landfill. Read
more in <a href="landfill_sites.html">our document on landfill sites</a>.

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Almost all households using a refuse collection service have to pay waste
charges. Waste charges and methods of payment can vary considerably. Check with
your refuse collection operator for further details.</p>

<p>Prices will not be increased during the period June 2016 to the end of June
2017. The option of payment by weight will be made available during this period
– see the introduction for more details.</p>

<p>The <a href="tax_relief_on_domestic_service_charges.html">tax relief
available on waste charges</a> has ended and can no longer be claimed.</p>

<p>In some areas, low-income households can avail of a waiver on waste charges.
To find out if a waiver scheme applies to you, contact your refuse collection
operator.</p>

<p>You can dispose of many different types of waste for free at recycling or
civic amenity centres. However, some centres may charge a small entry fee. You
may be charged for certain items such as mattresses or carpets, or for
particularly large quantities.</p>

<p>If you use a landfill site, there are entry charges for cars and car
trailers. Vans are charged at a commercial rate.</p>

<p>For more details of charges, check with the relevant centre or landfill
site, or check on the local authority’s website.</p>

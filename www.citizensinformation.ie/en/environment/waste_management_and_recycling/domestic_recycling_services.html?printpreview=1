<div class="topic">

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>There is a wide range of services and facilities to recycle domestic waste.
As well as reducing the volume of waste going to <a href="landfill_sites.html">landfill sites</a>, recycling and composting your
domestic waste helps to minimise waste collection charges.</p>

<p>Many of the items used in the home can be recycled. The benefits of
recycling include a cleaner environment, the safe disposal of hazardous
materials, greater awareness of excess packaging and a careful approach to the
use and re-use of materials.</p>

<p>Many products carry international recycling symbols that help to identify
how they can be re-used and/or disposed of safely – see ‘Recycling
symbols’ below.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l23f9a">How do I recycle?</h2>

<p>There are several ways of arranging to recycle waste. You can take it to a
recycling facility or use a kerbside collection (if available). For organic
waste, you may choose to compost it yourself – see ‘Composting’
below..</p>

<p>There are 3 types of permanent recycling facility: bring banks, civic
amenity sites and recycling centres. Most local authorities also set up
temporary collection points for Christmas trees each year. You can find out
what is available in your area from <a href="https://repak.ie/for-consumers/facilities-search/%20-%20facilities">Repak</a>
or from your local authority.</p>

<p><strong>Bring banks</strong> are unstaffed collection points for recyclable
materials like glass bottles, drinks cans and food cans. Some bring banks also
have collection bins for unwanted clothes.</p>

<p><strong>Civic amenity sites</strong> are similar to bring banks but can
accept a larger variety of items. They are purpose-built, are staffed and have
specific opening hours. In general they accept paper, cardboard, plastic and
glass bottles, drinks cans and food tins, textiles and footwear, electrical
equipment, fluorescent tubes, waste oil and DIY waste. Some also accept garden
waste and Christmas trees.</p>

<p>Staff at civic amenity sites can provide advice and information about
recycling and they may have home composting bins for sale.</p>

<p><strong>Recycling centres</strong> are also staffed and gated and have
specific opening hours, but accept a smaller variety of items than civic
amenity sites. In general they do not accept very bulky items. They are not
custom-built and tend to be located in existing sites such as local authority
depots.</p>

<p>Again, staff can provide advice and information about recycling and they may
have home composting bins for sale.</p>

<p><strong>Kerbside collection</strong> of recyclable waste is often known as a
‘green bin’ collection. Recyclable materials include plastic bottles, glass
bottles, drink cans, food tins, newspapers or magazines, cardboard and
compostable material. Most areas now have a separate bin collection for organic
waste – often called a ‘brown bin’ collection. Read more on <a href="http://www.brownbin.ie/">brownbin.ie</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Composting</strong> is the breakdown of organic material like
kitchen or garden waste by organisms that convert it into an earth-like mass,
which can then be used as a soil conditioner. Most garden waste and much
kitchen waste can be composted – see <a href="composting_domestic_waste.html">our document on composting</a>. Some
civic amenity centres accept organic materials, or you can use the ‘brown
bin’, if available. Many local authorities sell home composting bins at
subsidised rates.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l6967a">What can I recycle?</h2>

<p>A wide range of items can be accepted for recycling. Check with your local
centre or collection service as there can be considerable variation in what
they accept.</p>

<p>All materials should be clean, to avoid contamination – wash out bottles,
cans, yogurt pots etc. before recycling. The items most commonly recycled are:
</p>
<ul><li>Glass bottles and jars – recycle lids/caps separately </li>
  <li>Paper (newspapers, magazines, telephone books, office paper, junk mail,
    comics and light cardboard) </li>
  <li>Laminated or waxed papers like paper cups</li>
  <li>Drinks cartons (for milk, juice etc.) </li>
  <li>Aluminium (soft drink and beer cans, foil) </li>
  <li>Plastic bottles and cartons </li>
  <li>Food tins (fruit, vegetables, pet food) </li>
  <li>Plastic bottle tops, metal and aluminium lids </li>
  <li>Textiles (clean clothes, bed linen, towels, coats and jackets) </li>
  <li>White goods (washing machines, cookers, dryers, dishwashers, fridges)
  </li>
  <li>Batteries (also collected in shops and supermarkets) </li>
</ul><h3>Items that cannot be accepted for recycling</h3>
<ul><li>Crystal glass, Pyrex, television tubes, opal glass, (that is, alcohol
    bottles where a large amount of foil is glued to he bottle) and car
    windscreens </li>
  <li>Porcelain, pottery, stones and ceramic tiles </li>
  <li>Carpets and rugs, cushions or mattresses </li>
</ul><h3>Hazardous waste</h3>

<p>Many household products contain substances that are potentially harmful to
the environment. They include medicines, aerosols, bulbs and fluorescent tubes,
polishes, adhesives, household cleaners, drain cleaners, solvents, weedkillers
and fertilisers. Some of these items can be brought to a civic amenity centre
where they can be recycled or disposed of. Pharmaceutical drugs (such as
painkillers), medical waste (such as syringes or surgical gloves) and
containers for pharmaceutical drugs should be returned to your local pharmacy,
which can dispose of them properly. Some local authorities organise mobile
collections, where hazardous waste can be left at a central point. Contact your
local authority for further details.</p>

<h3>Recycling symbols</h3>

<p>The most common <a href="https://www.recyclenow.com/recycling-knowledge/packaging-symbols-explained">recycling
symbol</a> on products and packaging is the mobius loop - three arrows in a
circle. This means that a product is either recyclable or has some recycled
content.</p>

<p>Another common symbol is the <a href="http://greendot.ie/">Green Dot</a> –
a pan-European symbol that appears under licence on product packaging. It means
that the supplier of that packaging is committed to protecting the environment
by funding the recovery and recycling of their packaging waste.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Recycling services provided to the public are mainly free of charge.
However, civic amenity centres or recycling centres may charge for certain
items or for large quantities – check with your local <a href="http://www.repak.ie/recycling_facilities.php#facilities">centre</a>. A
charge for kerbside collection may also be included in your domestic waste
charges – check with your service provider.</p>

<p>Most local authorities also provide home composters at subsidised rates.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="lef21f">Where to apply</h2>

<p>For details of kerbside collections in your area, check your <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local
authority's website</a>.</p>

<p>To find a recycling facility, you can use <a href="http://www.repak.ie/recycling_facilities.php#facilities">Repak’s
search</a> or check the local authority's website.</p>

<p>Websites such as <a href="http://www.freetradeireland.ie/">Free Trade
Ireland</a> enable people to find new homes for unwanted items. </p>

<div class="topic further_info">
<h2 class="further_info" id="l9154f">What happens to recycled items?</h2>

<p><strong>Batteries</strong></p>

<p>Lead acid batteries (from cars, trucks, boats, tractors, etc.) are made of
plastic and contain dilute sulphuric acid and lead. During the recycling
process, the batteries are crushed, the acid is drained off and neutralised and
the plastic and lead are compacted and baled for recycling. Button batteries
(cameras, hearing aids, watches, computers and calculators) can be recycled
using a thermal process. Domestic rechargeable batteries (mobile and cordless
phones, laptops, power tools and cordless appliances) can be also recycled
using a thermal process, which reclaims the cadmium, nickel and iron. The
reclaimed cadmium is used to make new batteries while the nickel and iron are
used to make stainless steel.</p>

<p><strong>Glass</strong></p>

<p>Glass must be sorted according to colour to avoid contamination. It is
crushed and turned into ‘cullet’. In the making of new glass, cullet can be
up to 40% of the raw material. This amounts to significant savings in raw
materials and energy needed to melt the glass.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicles</strong></p>

<p>Vehicles can be dismantled, stripped of any valuable materials and crushed
for smelting.</p>

<p><strong>Household white goods</strong></p>

<p>Household appliances like washing machines, cookers, dryers, dishwashers and
toasters can be dismantled. The ferrous and non-ferrous metals are separated
and the rest is disposed of. There are also specialist recyclers who process
the more complex items such as computers and televisions. These recyclers
separate components of the equipment for resale or recycling of valuable
materials. They may also refurbish entire systems for resale.</p>

<p><strong>Aluminium</strong></p>

<p>The aluminium can is one of the most valuable waste materials. Aluminium
foil can also be recycled – both the heavy foil that comes with take-away
meals, ready-cook meals etc. and the lighter ‘tin foil’ used in cooking.
Baled aluminium cans and foil are smelted into ingots, which are then rolled
before being made into cans and other products.</p>

<p><strong>Oil</strong></p>

<p>Waste mineral oil (fuel oil and lubrication oil) can be reprocessed and
re-sold as low-grade industrial lubricant or industrial boiler fuel oil to
generate heat, electricity or both. Vegetable oils, such as cooking oil, should
never be mixed with mineral oil. These oils can be cleaned and used in animal
feeds, or in fuel for adapted cars. Some recycling centres accept domestic
cooking oils.</p>

<p><strong>Paper</strong></p>

<p>For fire safety reasons, paper recycling facilities must be supervised.
Newspapers, magazines, office paper, junk mail, light cardboard, telephone
books, greeting cards, calendars and diaries, paper bags, comics can all be
recycled. Collected paper goes to paper mills, where it is recycled into new
paper.</p>

<p><strong>Plastic</strong></p>

<p>The plastics industry has a code for labelling different plastic materials
to help with identification and recycling. The majority of plastic containers
found in the home are made from HDPE, LDPE, PVC or PET. Most of the containers
for soft drinks are made from PET (polyethene terephthalate). These bottles can
be shredded and recycled as fibre for the polyester lining for sleeping bags,
pillows and quilted jackets. Recycled plastics can be used for fencing, garden
furniture, car bumpers, plastic bags, PVC pipes and flooring.</p>

<p><strong>Green waste</strong></p>

<p>Home composting provides an excellent soil conditioner and allows most
kitchen and garden waste to be recycled. Some civic amenity centres provide
composting services and sell the compost. Most local authorities also recycle
Christmas trees. They are shredded and the shavings are used for
landscaping.</p>

<p><strong>Textiles</strong></p>

<p>Clothes and textiles that are suitable for re-sale are sent to charity shops
to be sold. Clothes and textiles that are not suitable are recycled into carpet
underlay felt, machine-wiping cloths or fibre filler for furniture.</p>

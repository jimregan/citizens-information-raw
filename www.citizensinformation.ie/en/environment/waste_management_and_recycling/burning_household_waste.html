<p>It is illegal to burn household or garden waste at home or in your garden.
Burning waste can be a nuisance to neighbours and can also <a href="../environmental_protection/air_pollution.html">pollute the air</a> by
releasing harmful chemicals into it. </p>

<p>There may be many toxic chemicals in waste items. Paper waste may contain
synthetic materials, preservatives and even plastics. Disposable nappies
contain gels, bleaches and plastics. Many wood products are treated with toxic
chemicals to prevent rot.</p>

<p>Burning of such wastes in low-temperature uncontrolled fires creates toxic
and dangerous by-products which are not destroyed by the fire but become
airborne on soot particles. These can end up being inhaled or being washed out
of the air and deposited onto surrounding soil and vegetation, where they can
readily enter the food chain.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Burning household waste at home or in your garden is illegal. Burning
household waste can incur a fine of up to â‚¬3,000 or 12 months in prison upon
summary conviction in a District Court.</p>

<p>Examples of where you <strong>cannot</strong> burn household or garden waste
are:</p>
<ul><li>In a barrel or exposed pile in the yard or garden </li>
  <li>On a bonfire </li>
  <li>On an open fire, range or other solid fuel appliance </li>
  <li>In a mini-incinerator </li>
</ul><p>Waste burners and other devices such as mini or household incinerators,
which may be located in buildings or gardens, are illegal even if they are
attached to a stack or flue.</p>

<p>Burning waste is an offence under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/Waste/WasteMgmtActs/">waste
management legislation</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1987/en/act/pub/0006/index.html">Air
Pollution Act 1987</a>. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/si/286/made/en/print">Waste
Management (Prohibition of Waste Disposal by Burning) Regulations 2009</a>
strengthen the law against waste disposal by uncontrolled burning, which is
also known as backyard burning. </p>

<p>Under Regulation 5, there is a limited exemption for the burning of
uncontaminated waste generated by agricultural practices. Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/si/538/made/en/print">Waste
Management (Prohibition of Waste Disposal by Burning) (Amendment) Regulations
2015</a>, this exemption will cease on 1 January 2018. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l9f0c9">Safely disposing of waste</h2>

<p>Most areas have an organised <a href="domestic_refuse.html">domestic
waste collection</a> service. If you decide not to use an organised waste
collection service, you can dispose of much of your own domestic waste by <a shape="rect" href="domestic_recycling_services.html">recycling</a> and <a shape="rect" href="composting_domestic_waste.html">home composting</a>. You can
also use civic amenity centres or <a shape="rect" href="landfill_sites.html">landfill sites</a>. </p>

<p>Your <a shape="rect" href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local
authority</a> can advise you on waste disposal and recycling facilities in your
area.</p>

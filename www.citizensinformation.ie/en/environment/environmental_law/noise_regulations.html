<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>This document outlines the main types of noise that can cause a nuisance and
the legislation that deals with such noise. Various bodies have roles as
regards complaints about different types or sources of noise – these are
described under the relevant headings below. There is <a href="http://www.askaboutireland.ie/enfo/irelands-environment/noise/noise-pollution/">general
information about noise pollution on askaboutireland.ie</a>.</p>

<p>The main legislation is the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0007/index.html">Environmental
Protection Agency Act 1992</a>, which defines environmental pollution as
including noise that is a nuisance, or that would endanger human health or
damage property or damage the environment. It provides for various actions to
be taken to prevent or limit noise pollution. Local authorities have powers
under the Act to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit noise, and
you can report a noise nuisance to the Environment Section of the relevant <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local
authority</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/si/0179.html">regulations made
under the Act</a> provide direct access to the courts by individuals or groups
who are concerned about excessive noise. The <a href="http://www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/attachments/pdf_version_of_guide_to_the_noise_regulations_2015_0.pdf">Guide
to the Noise Regulations (pdf)</a> outlines the steps you can take if you are
experiencing a nuisance caused by noise. </p>

<p>Read more information on <a href="http://www.housing.gov.ie/environment/noise/typical-causes-noise-nuisance">typical
causes of noise nuisance</a> and <a href="http://www.housing.gov.ie/environment/noise/appropriate-courses-action-different-sources-noise">what
you can do if you are affected by noise</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l84e98">Noise from commercial premises, processes or
works</h2>

<p>The Act gives power to the <a href="http://www.epa.ie/">Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA)</a> to take steps to ensure compliance with the terms
of a notice to control noise in relation to any premises, process or works and
to recover the cost of such an action. The EPA can require the person or body
to take specific measures to prevent or limit noise. Anyone required to take
such specific measures by the EPA must do so or face prosecution.</p>

<p>Local authorities have similar powers to the EPA in relation to premises,
processes and works other than those that require licensing under the Act. The
local authority may serve a notice on the person in charge of, for example,
pubs, discos, processes or works. This notice requires the person in charge to
take whatever measures are set out in the notice in order to prevent or limit
noise. The local authority may prosecute for failure to comply with the notice.
Alternatively, it may take steps itself to ensure compliance and then recover
the costs of these from the person in charge.</p>

<p>Pubs can only sell liquor if they have a <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/excise/excise-licensing/publicans-licences.html">licence</a>,
which is renewed annually by the courts. Anyone may object to the granting of a
licence on various grounds, including that the activity of the premises was not
being conducted in a peaceable and orderly manner. Read more on the <a href="http://www.courts.ie/offices.nsf/lookuppagelink/DE8C5C1BEECE1ABA80256E77006247EB">Courts
Service website</a>.</p>

<p>The EPA has the power to serve notices in respect of activities that it
licenses, such as waste disposal activities and activities that require <a href="pollution_prevention_and_control.html">Integrated Pollution Prevention
and Control (IPPC)</a> licences.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lc8382">Environmental noise</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/si/0140.html">Environmental Noise
Regulations 2006</a> give effect to <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0049:EN:HTML">EU
Directive 2002/49/EC</a> on the assessment and management of environmental
noise. </p>

<p>Environmental noise means unwanted or harmful outdoor sound created by human
activities, including noise from transport, road traffic, rail traffic, air
traffic, and from sites of industrial activity. The Directive applies to noise
to which humans are exposed, particularly in built-up areas, public parks or
other quiet areas within built-up areas, and in quiet areas in open country,
near schools, hospitals and other noise-sensitive buildings and areas. It does
not apply to noise from domestic activities, noise created by neighbours, noise
at workplaces or noise inside means of transport or due to military activities
in military areas.</p>

<p>Under the Directive, local authorities are required to make action plans to
reduce ambient noise. The EPA exercises general supervision over the functions
and actions of the local authorities in this aspect of their work.</p>

<p>When granting <a href="../../housing/planning_permission/planning_permission_general.html">planning
permission</a>, the local authority has the power to provide that conditions in
relation to noise prevention or reduction be included in the permission. These
conditions may apply to the construction phase and/or to the subsequent use of
the building. You can appeal to <a href="../../housing/planning_permission/an_bord_pleanala.html">An Bord
Pleanála</a> against any such requirements (or the absence of them).</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l3076c">Domestic noise</h2>

<p>The Gardaí have the power to arrest a person for breach of the peace in a
public place. They may ask someone to lower the noise coming from a dwelling
but they do not have the power to enter a dwelling with the intention of simply
asking someone to lower the noise. If the noise is persistent, you may complain
to the District Court – see <a href="noise_regulations.en.html#l4a9c0">Complaints under the EPA Act</a> below.
There is useful information in the <a href="http://www.flac.ie/download/pdf/neighbour_disputes.pdf">leaflet on
neighbour disputes (pdf)</a> published by <a href="http://www.flac.ie/">FLAC,
the Free Legal Advice Centres</a>.</p>

<h3>Rented dwellings</h3>

<p>If the noise is coming from a rented dwelling and you don’t get a
satisfactory response from the tenants, you can complain to the landlord –
whether this is a private landlord, a local authority or a housing
association.</p>

<p>People who are renting from private landlords or <a href="../../housing/local_authority_and_social_housing/housing_associations.html">housing
associations</a> have certain <a href="../../housing/renting_a_home/tenants_rights_and_obligations.html">obligations</a>.
These include not engaging in anti-social behaviour, which includes persistent
noise that interferes with the peaceful occupation of other dwellings. You may
complain to the <a href="../../housing/renting_a_home/private_residential_tenancies_board.html">Residential
Tenancies Board (RTB)</a> if a private landlord or housing association fails to
enforce the tenant’s obligations in respect of noise.</p>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0022/print.html#sched3">Housing
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009</a>, tenants of local authority housing are
obliged to avoid any nuisance (including noise) to the occupiers of any other
dwelling. If the noise persists, the tenants are in breach of their tenancy
agreement and the local authority can take steps to enforce the terms of the
agreement.</p>

<h3>Alarms</h3>

<p>Installers of alarm systems are required to have licences from the <a href="http://www.psa.gov.ie/">Private Security Authority</a>. In order to get a
licence, they have to adhere to certain standards, including maximum times for
the sounding of external alarms – the maximum under the <a href="http://www.nsai.ie/Our-Services/Certification/Product-Certification/Product-Certificaton-for-Security-Systems.aspx">European
standard</a> is 15 minutes. The local authority, the EPA or an individual may
take action under the EPA Act to deal with <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/Noise/FaultyAlarms/">breaches of
these standards</a>.</p>

<h3>Dogs</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1986/en/act/pub/0032/sec0025.html">Section
25 of the Control of Dogs Act 1986</a> deals with nuisance by barking dogs. If
you don’t get a satisfactory response from the dog owner, you may complain to
the District Court, using the form prescribed under the Control of Dogs Act.
These forms are available from local authorities.</p>

<p>The court may make an order requiring the occupier of the premises in which
the dog is kept to abate the nuisance by exercising due control over a dog. The
court may limit the number of dogs that can be kept on a premises or may direct

<h3>Noise from motor vehicles</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1963/en/si/0190.html">Road
Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963</a>
require vehicles to be fitted with a silencer or other device suitable for
reducing to a reasonable level noise caused by the escape of exhaust gases from
the engine and they prohibit use of a vehicle that causes any excessive noise
in a public place. The <a href="../../travel_and_recreation/vehicle_standards/national_car_test.html">National
Car Test</a> (NCT) includes an assessment of the effectiveness of the silencer
in reducing exhaust-related noise.</p>

<p>The Regulations also provide that a driver may use a horn only to warn other
road users of oncoming danger, or to make them aware of the driver’s presence
for safety reasons when reasonably necessary. A horn may not be used in a
built-up area between 11 pm and 7 am unless there is a traffic emergency.</p>

<p>Contact the <a href="../../justice/law_enforcement/garda_siochana_national_police_force.html">Gardaí</a>
if you wish to complain about breaches of these rules.</p>

<p>The EU standards for car alarms set minimum and maximum time limits for the
sounding of the alarm (25 seconds minimum and 30 seconds maximum).</p>

<h3>Aircraft noise</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.iaa.ie/">Irish Aviation Authority</a> (IAA) is
responsible for controlling noise from aircraft. The EU rules on noise at large
airports are implemented in Ireland by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/si/0645.html">European Communities
(Air Navigation and Transport Rules and Procedures for Noise Related Operating
Restrictions at Airports) Regulations 2003</a>.</p>

<h3>Workplace noise</h3>

<p>The Health and Safety Authority deals with queries regarding <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Topics/Physical_Agents/Noise/">noise in the
workplace</a> and it has published a set of <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Topics/Physical_Agents/Noise/Noise_-_Frequently_Asked_Questions/">FAQs
on this issue</a>. You can read more in <a href="../../employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/health_and_safety/health_safety_work.html">our
document on health and safety at work</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l4a9c0">Complaints under the EPA Act </h2>

<p>While the law does not specifically mention an exact level or standard of
noise that is illegal, it is clear that if neighbourhood noise is affecting
your quality of life, then you have a right to complain. If you plan to
complain about excessive noise, it is generally recommended that you keep a
detailed diary of the times when it occurred, the duration and, if possible,
the levels involved.</p>

<p>You should first approach the person or business causing the noise, explain
that it is a nuisance and try to come to a mutually acceptable solution.</p>

<h3>Applying to the District Court</h3>

<p>If this does not work, the Act allows any person, a local authority or the
EPA to complain to the District Court about a noise that is ‘so loud, so
continuous, so repeated, of such duration or pitch or occurring at such times
as to give reasonable cause for annoyance to a person in any premises in the
neighbourhood or to a person lawfully using any public place’ and seek an
order to deal with the noise nuisance. There is <a href="http://www.courts.ie/courts.ie/library3.nsf/pagecurrent/B1891D43DC769B2280257FB20037F683?opendocument&amp;l=en">a
small fee</a>.</p>

<p>Consult the Clerk of the local <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a> about an
appointment for the hearing of your case. You will need to refer exactly to the
legislation under which you are making the complaint – <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0007/sec0108.html#zza7y1992s108">Section
108 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992</a> and the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/si/0179.html">Environmental
Protection Agency Act (Noise) Regulations 1994</a>.</p>

<p>At least 7 days before the date for the hearing of your case, you must serve
notice on the person or business you are complaining about, using the <a href="http://www.courts.ie/Courts.ie/library3.nsf/(WebFiles)/F898216470D2548E8025784F00562C00/%24FILE/EPA%20Act%2C%201992.doc">Environmental
Protection Agency Act 1992 - noise form of notice</a>. It is important to use
this form of notice only and to complete it fully and accurately.</p>

<p>A person making noise in the course of trade or business may have a defence
if it can be shown that all reasonable care was taken to prevent the noise or
that the noise is in accordance with a licence issued under the Act.</p>

<p>If the court finds in your favour, it can order the person or body making,
causing or responsible for the noise to take measures to prevent or limit the
noise. Any such orders must be complied with.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>There is international agreement by scientists and governments that the
Earth’s climate is changing. While the global climate has changed many times
due to natural processes and factors, human activities over the last two
centuries have resulted in global warming – see ‘Causes of climate
change’ below. This in turn leads to more extreme and unstable weather –
storms, floods and droughts – and coastal erosion, as well as warmer weather
in some parts of the world. Meteorological records show that <a href="http://www.climateadaptation.eu/ireland/climate-change/">Ireland’s
climate is changing in line with global patterns</a>.</p>

<p>Ireland participates in international efforts to combat climate change –
see ‘Tackling climate change’ below. A <a href="http://www.environ.ie/sites/default/files/migrated-files/en/Publications/Environment/Atmosphere/FileDownLoad%2C37827%2Cen.pdf">national
policy position (pdf)</a> was published in January 2014 and <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/Atmosphere/ClimateChange/News/MainBody,43813,en.htm">new
legislation is in place</a> – see ‘Climate change legislation’ below.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="ld80b5">Causes of climate change</h2>

<p>The natural factors that lead to climate change include volcanic eruptions,
changes in the sun’s intensity and slow changes in the Earth’s orbit.
Humans contribute to climate change through activities that emit <em>greenhouse
gases</em>. These are heat-trapping gases that accumulate in the atmosphere and
prevent heat from escaping into space, thus causing the Earth’s surface and
the lower atmosphere to get warmer. This has been compared to the heat-trapping
effect of a greenhouse and is known as the <em>greenhouse effect</em>.</p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is the main greenhouse gas emitted by human
activities. It is generated by burning fossil fuels, such as petrol, diesel,
oil, coal, peat and gas. The agriculture sector emits nitrous oxide
(N<sub>2</sub>O) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>). Other greenhouse gases include
the <a href="http://www.epa.ie/air/airenforcement/ozone/fluorinatedgreenhousegases/#.VMEwzYlybhk">fluorinated
gases</a>: hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), sulphur
hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF<sub>3</sub>).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.epa.ie/">Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a>
compiles figures on Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions for each sector:
agriculture; industry and commercial; transport; energy; residential and waste.
It has published a <a href="http://www.epa.ie/pubs/reports/climatechange/infographic_ghg_.pdf">simple
guide (pdf)</a> to Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions and has also produced a
<a href="http://www.epa.ie/climate/communicatingclimatescience/whatisclimatechange/visualisingirelandsgreenhousegasemissions/#.VMExv4lybhk">visual
representation</a> of the volume of gas emitted into the atmosphere.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="laefa8">Impacts of climate change</h2>

<p>The EPA has noted several <a href="http://www.epa.ie/climate/communicatingclimatescience/whatisclimatechange/whatimpactwillclimatechangehaveforireland/#d.en.42707">impacts
of climate change on Ireland</a>. They include:</p>
<ul><li>More intense storms and rainfall events</li>
  <li>More frequent and intense river and coastal flooding</li>
  <li>Effects on water quality</li>
  <li>Changes in distribution of plant and animal species</li>
  <li>Rises in sea level</li>
  <li>Increased acidification of seawater and changes in sea temperature,
    affecting some fisheries</li>
  <li>Summer water shortages</li>
</ul></div>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lde0c3">Tackling climate change</h2>

<p>Several international agreements have been made with a view to <a href="http://www.epa.ie/climate/communicatingclimatescience/whatisclimatechange/addresssingclimatechange/#.VMIhaolybhk">tackling
climate change</a> by significantly reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.
Ireland is part of these <a href="http://www.epa.ie/climate/climate%20change%20processes/#.VMIjPYlybhk">international
efforts to combat climate change</a>. It has signed up to the <a href="http://unfccc.int/2860.php">United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change</a> and its <a href="http://www.epa.ie/climate/thekyotoprotocol/#.VMIQ1Ilybhk.">Kyoto
Protocol</a>. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2030/index_en.htm">2030
Climate and Energy Framework</a> agreed in October 2014 committed the EU to a
40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions relative to 1990.</p>

<p>More recently, Ireland attended the Lima conference of December 2014, which
resulted in the <a href="http://www.sraidmhuirfean.ie/en/News-Room/Releases/Parties_at_Lima_Climate_COP_agree_significant_step_on_the_road_to_new_agreement_in_Paris.html">Lima
call for climate action</a>. This fed into the Paris Agreement on climate
change, which was <a href="http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en/195-countries-adopt-the-first-universal-climate-agreement/">adopted
at the COP21 conference in December 2015</a> and is due to come into effect in
2020. It includes <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/adaptation/index_en.htm">adaptation to
climate change</a> as well as the existing mitigation policies of cutting and
curbing greenhouse gas emissions. </p>

<p>Steps already taken include participation in the EU’s <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/index_en.htm">Emissions Trading
System</a> and the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/si/0465.html">regulation of
fluorinated greenhouse gases</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="lc6d1b">Climate change legislation</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/46/enacted/en/html">Climate
Action and Low-Carbon Development Act 2015</a> provides for new arrangements
aimed at achieving transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient and
environmentally sustainable economy by 2050. It builds on the existing <a href="http://www.environ.ie/environment/climate-change/adaptation/national-climate-change-adaptation-framework">National
Climate Change Adaptation Framework</a>. </p>

<p>These arrangements include a national mitigation plan, which will specify
the policy measures needed to manage greenhouse gas emissions to meet national
and international targets. They also include a national climate change
adaptation framework, with a view to reducing the State’s vulnerability to
the negative impacts of climate change and availing of any positive impacts.
These 2 plans – the mitigation plan and the framework – are to be published
within specified timeframes. They are to be reviewed at least every 5 years.</p>

<p>Under the Act, a high-level <a href="http://www.climatecouncil.ie/">Climate
Change Advisory Council</a> has been established to advise and recommend on the
preparation of these national plans and on compliance with relevant
international obligations of the State. It will publish an annual review, based
on the national <a href="http://www.epa.ie/climate/emissionsinventoriesandprojections/nationalemissionsinventories/#.VMI6W4lybhk">inventory
of greenhouse gas emissions</a>, and will make recommendations on how the
State’s climate-related objectives and obligations can be achieved. It will
also undertake periodic reviews to ensure that climate policy remains up to
date and that progress is maintained on implementing the 2 national plans.</p>

<p>The Council <a href="http://www.climatecouncil.ie/news/">published its first
report in November 2016</a>.</p>

<p>Relevant Ministers will have to prepare <em>sectoral mitigation
measures</em> for inclusion in the national mitigation plan, specifying the
measures they propose in order to reduce emissions in their sectors. They will
also have to produce <em>sectoral adaptation plans</em> for how their sectors
can adapt to climate change, in the context of the national adaptation
framework.</p>

<p>The Minister for Communication, Climate Action and the Environment, along
with Ministers who have prepared sectoral contributions, will have to report
annually to Dáil Éireann on progress made in the transition to a low-carbon,
climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy, outline any measures
needed to improve progress, and give reasons if they are not following the
Expert Advisory Council’s recommendations. In addition, the Minister for
Communication, Climate Action and the Environment will have to report on
compliance with any relevant climate-related, existing obligation of the State
under European Union law or any international agreement.</p>

<p>Public bodies will have to consider the objectives set out in the national
plans and relevant sectoral adaptation plans. They will have to integrate these
objectives into their strategic planning and day-to-day decision-making and
will have to take the necessary steps as regards mitigation and adaptation in
their areas of responsibility.</p>

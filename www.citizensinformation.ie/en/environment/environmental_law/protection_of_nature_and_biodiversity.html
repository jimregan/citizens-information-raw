<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Biodiversity is the variety of different plants, animals and
micro-organisms, their genes and the ecosystems of which they are a part.
Biodiversity is important for our survival and economic development. Food
security and the discovery of new medicines are put at risk by the loss of
biodiversity. Vital goods and services that are often taken for granted, such
as clean air and fresh water, are threatened by the deterioration of
ecosystems.</p>

<p>There is EU and Irish law which aims to ensure biodiversity by conserving
natural habitats and wild flora and fauna. </p>

<h3>Birds Directive</h3>

<p>The Birds Directive (that is, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/legislation/birdsdirective/index_en.htm">Directive
2009/147/EC</a> on the conservation of wild birds) has 3 main elements:</p>
<ul><li>It provides for habitat conservation, including a requirement to
    designate Special Protected Areas (SPAs) for migratory and other vulnerable
    wild bird species </li>
  <li>It bans activities that directly threaten birds (such as the deliberate
    destruction of nests and the taking of eggs) and associated activities such
    as trading in live or dead birds </li>
  <li>It establishes rules that limit the number of species that can be hunted,
    the periods during which they can be hunted and the permitted methods of
    hunting. </li>
</ul><h3>Habitats Directive </h3>

<p>The Habitats Directive (<a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31992L0043:EN:HTML">Directive
92/43/EEC</a> on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild flora and
fauna) provides for the creation of a <a shape="rect" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/index_en.htm">network
of protected sites known as Natura 2000</a>. These sites include SPAs (under
the Birds Directive) and other sites proposed by EU member states which meet
specific scientific criteria. The designated sites must then all be run in
accordance with the safeguards set out in the Directive. This means that there
must be:</p>
<ul><li>Prior assessment of potentially damaging plans and projects </li>
  <li>A requirement that these plans and projects be approved only if they
    represent an overriding interest and only if no alternative solution exists
  </li>
  <li>Measures for providing compensatory habitats in the event of damage. </li>
</ul><p>The Directive also provides for a ban on the downgrading of breeding and
resting places for certain animal species. This legislation is implemented in
Ireland by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1976/en/act/pub/0039/index.html">Wildlife
Act 1976</a>, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0038/index.html">Wildlife
(Amendment) Act 2000</a> and the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/si/0477.html">European Communities
(Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011</a>.</p>

<h3>Protected sites</h3>

<p>The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) publishes <a href="http://www.npws.ie/protected-sites">lists of sites that are protected
under European and national legislation</a>. These include Special Protected
Areas (SPAs) under the Birds Directive, Special Areas of Conservation (SACs)
under the Habitats Directive and National Heritage Areas (NHAs) designated
under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0038/index.html">Wildlife
(Amendment) Act 2000</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.npws.ie/protected-sites/designation-process">Details of
the process for designation of protected sites</a> are available on the NPWS
website, including information on objecting to a proposed designation;
appealing if the objection fails; and compensation provisions for people who
lose financially as a result of a site being designated.</p>

<p>A number of <a href="http://www.npws.ie/peatlands-and-turf-cutting">raised
bogs</a> have been designated as SACs or NHAs. Landowners and holders of
turbary rights who are affected by the restriction on turf cutting on these
bogs can apply for compensation under the <a href="http://www.npws.ie/peatlands-and-turf-cutting/turf-cutting-compensation-scheme">Cessation
of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme</a>.</p>

<h3>Biodiversity</h3>

<p>The European Commission has adopted the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020.
The 6 targets of the Strategy cover:</p>
<ul><li>Full implementation of EU nature legislation to protect biodiversity</li>
  <li>Better protection for ecosystems, and more use of green
  infrastructure</li>
  <li>More sustainable agriculture and forestry</li>
  <li>Better management of fish stocks</li>
  <li>Tighter controls on invasive alien species</li>
  <li>A bigger EU contribution to averting global biodiversity loss </li>
</ul><p>The EU is a party to the <a href="http://www.cbd.int/">UN Convention on
Biological Diversity</a>. This commits the parties (among other things) to
creating a network of nature protection and conservation areas to safeguard
biodiversity. </p>

<p>The EU is also a party to a number of other Conventions, including the <a href="http://www.cms.int/">Convention on migratory species (Bonn
Convention)</a>, the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/104.htm">Convention on
the conservation of European Wildlife and habitats (Berne Convention)</a> and
the <a href="http://www.unep-aewa.org/">Agreement on the conservation of
African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA)</a>. </p>

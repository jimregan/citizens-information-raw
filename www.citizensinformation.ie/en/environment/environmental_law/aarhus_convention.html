<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on
Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to
Justice in Environmental Matters (commonly referred to as <a href="http://www.unece.org/env/pp/welcome.html">the Aarhus Convention</a>) was
adopted on 25 June 1998. Ireland ratified the Convention on 20 June 2012. See
environ.ie for <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/AarhusConvention/">more about the
Aarhus Convention</a>.</p>

<p>Ireland has also ratified 2 related agreements – the Protocol on Pollutant
Release and Transfer Registers and the GMO Amendment to the Aarhus Convention,
both described below. The Convention and these 2 related agreements entered
into force on 18 September 2012.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l46bcb">Provisions of Aarhus Convention</h2>

<p>The Aarhus Convention lays down a set of basic rules to promote public
involvement in environmental matters. The Convention has 3 pillars:</p>
<ol><li><p><strong>Access to environmental information</strong>: This includes
    information on the state of the environment and/or on human health issues
    as well as information on policies and measures taken. Read more in our
    document on <a href="access_to_environmental_information.html">Access to
    environmental information</a>. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>Public participation in environmental decision
    making</strong>: Members of the public have a right to participate in a
    range of decisions where there may be an environmental impact. These
    include planning matters and other environmental licensing decisions, such
    as foreshore licences, waste licences and Integrated Pollution Prevention
    Control licences. Public authorities responsible for decision making on
    such licences are obliged to publish notices on specific licence
    applications, which must inform the public on how they may participate.
    Comments submitted by the public are to be taken into consideration in the
    decision-making process. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>Access to justice in environmental matters</strong>: Members
    of the public and environmental non-governmental organisations have the
    right to seek a review of decisions that have been made which may affect
    the environment. The review procedures must provide “adequate and
    effective remedies ... and be fair, equitable, timely and not prohibitively
    expensive”. </p>
    <p>Normally, where legislation provides for an administrative appeal
    against a planning or environmental decision, this appeal mechanism should
    be used first before applying for judicial review of a decision. For
    example, a planning decision would normally be appealed in the first
    instance to An Bord Pleanála.</p>
    <p>In Ireland, the requirement to provide a mechanism to challenge the
    substantive and procedural legality of a decision of a public body is
    ultimately met by way of <a href="judicial_review_in_planning_and_environmental_matters.html">judicial
    review</a>. See courts.ie for <a href="http://www.courts.ie/courts.ie/library3.nsf/pagecurrent/86F3E130183672A080257FB2003DD36A?opendocument&amp;l=en">information
    on the court fees payable</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol></div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l48ff9">EU Directives and national legislation</h2>

<p>The European Union has introduced 2 Directives to implement the Aarhus
Convention:</p>
<ol><li><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:041:0026:0032:EN:PDF">Directive
    2003/4/EC on Public Access to Environmental Information (pdf)</a> </li>
  <li><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32003L0035">Directive
    2003/35/EC on Public Participation</a> in respect of the drawing up of
    certain plans and programmes relating to the environment</li>
</ol><p>Both Directives have been fully implemented in Ireland.</p>

<p>As well as legislation transposing these Directives, additional measures
were included in the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0020/index.html">Environment
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011</a> to implement parts of the Convention.
This Act introduced new rules about costs to apply in certain cases, as well as
a requirement that judicial notice be taken of the Convention.</p>

<p>In total, over <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/AarhusConvention/AarhusLegislation/">60
pieces of legislation</a> have been used to implement the Aarhus Convention in
Ireland. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld5b00">Protocol on Pollutant Release and
Transfer Registers</h2>

<p>A Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR) is a national or regional
environmental database or inventory of potentially hazardous chemical
substances and/or pollutants released to air, water and soil, and transferred
off-site for treatment or disposal. The main objective of the <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Environment/Miscellaneous/FileDownLoad,18796,en.pdf">Protocol
on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (pdf)</a> is to enhance public
access to information through the establishment of coherent, integrated PRTRs,
in order to facilitate public participation in environmental decision making
and contribute to the prevention and reduction of environmental pollution. </p>

<p>Ireland signed the Protocol on PRTRs in 2003. This Protocol is an
international instrument committing the participating countries to establish
and maintain publicly accessible registers that contain information on a wide
range of pollutants from certain environmentally significant activities.</p>

<p>Legislative and other measures have been put in place to ensure that
Ireland’s obligations under the Protocol are fulfilled. The key objective of
the Protocol is the establishment of a national PRTR to meet specific
requirements under the Protocol.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/si/0649.html">Pollutant
Release and Transfer Register Regulations 2011 (SI 649 of 2011)</a> designate
the <a href="http://epa.ie/">Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a> as the
Competent Authority for the purposes of the PRTR Protocol. In October 2011, the
EPA established <a href="http://prtr.epa.ie/">Ireland's PRTR</a>, which
contains information about emissions from more than 300 industrial facilities
across the State and enables members of the public to find out about the major
sources of polluting emissions in their immediate environs.</p>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l90b49">GMO Amendment to the Aarhus
Convention </h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/documents/2005/pp/ece/ece.mp.pp.2005.2.add.2.e.pdf">Genetically
Modified Organisms Amendment to the Aarhus Convention (pdf)</a> was adopted in
2005. It puts in place requirements for public participation in decisions
concerning the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
These requirements are more specific than the general requirements concerning
public participation which apply to other issues covered by the Aarhus
Convention.</p>

<p>‘Deliberate Release’ refers to the placing on the market of genetically
modified (GM) products or the cultivation of GM crops. It does not include the
use of GMOs in controlled settings, such as laboratories. Find further
information on GMOs on the websites of the <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/GMO/">Department of Communication, Climate Action and the Environment</a> and the <a href="http://www.epa.ie/licensing/gmo/#.VsyKDyu2pFc">EPA</a>. </p>

<p>The GMO Amendment has been implemented in the EU by <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0018:en:HTML">Directive
2001/18/EC on the Deliberate Release of GMOs</a>. </p>

<p>This Directive has been transposed in Ireland by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/si/0500.html">Genetically Modified
Organisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations 2003 (SI 500 of 2003)</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic further_info">
<h2 class="further_info" id="l433cd">Aarhus Compliance Committee</h2>

<p>Article 15 of the Aarhus Convention established arrangements for reviewing
compliance with the Convention. For that purpose a Compliance Committee has
been established to discuss and decide on possible breaches of the Convention.
Ireland has been subject to the compliance mechanism since 18 September 2013,
one year after the date the agreement came into effect. <a href="http://www.unece.org/env/pp/cc.html">Find more information about the
Committee and its work</a>.</p>

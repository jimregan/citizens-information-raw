<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>There is a wide range of EU legislation in force concerning the environment.
The main areas covered are:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="protection_of_nature_and_biodiversity.html">Nature
    and biodiversity</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="pollution_prevention_and_control.html">Integrated
    pollution control</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="waste_management.html">Waste management</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="air_pollution.html">Air pollution</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../water_services/water_quality.html">Water

  <li><a shape="rect" href="genetically_modified_organisms.html">Genetically
    modified organisms</a> </li>
</ul><p>Much of <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/chapter/environment.html?root_default=SUM_1_CODED=20">EU
legislation to protect the environment</a> is quite technical, in that it sets
out detailed technical and scientific standards. It is also usual for the
legislation to require member states to provide information to the European
Commission about how they are implementing the rules and about how effective
they have been. </p>

<p>In addition, there are several international conventions on environmental
protection. In general, these are ratified by the EU and then implemented
through EU legislation.<br></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/Pages/home.aspx">Department of
Communications, Climate Action and Environment</a>, the <a href="../../government_in_ireland/local_and_regional_government/local_authorities.html">local
authorities</a> and the <a href="https://www.epa.ie/">Environmental Protection
Agency</a> are the main bodies responsible for implementing environmental
legislation in Ireland. The principal environmental Acts are: <br><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0007/index.html">Environmental
Protection Agency Act 1992</a> <br><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0010/index.html">Waste

<h3>EU enforcement of environmental legislation</h3>

<p>EU environmental legislation is enforced in the same way as other EU
legislation. The <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/european_government/eu_institutions/european_commission.html">European
Commission</a> monitors its implementation and may bring individual member
states to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/european_government/eu_institutions/european_court_of_justice.html">European
Court of Justice (ECJ)</a> for failure to properly implement it. </p>

<p><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/legal/crime/index.htm">Environmental
crime</a> covers acts that breach environmental legislation and cause
significant harm or risk to the environment and human health. They include the
illegal emissions or discharges into air, water or soil, the illegal trade in
wildlife, illegal trade in ozone-depleting substances and the illegal shipment
or dumping of waste.</p>

<p><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32008L0099">Directive
2008/99/EC</a> on the protection of the environment through criminal law was
adopted on 28 October 2008.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l353ac">EU policy on the environment</h2>
EU policy on the environment is reflected in its legislation and supported by
some financial programmes. The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/action-programme/">7th Environment Action
Programme</a> of the EU, entitled <em>Living well, within the limits of our
planet </em>runs to 2020 and focuses on 3 priority areas for action: 
<ul><li>To protect, conserve and enhance the Unionâ€™s natural capital</li>
  <li>To turn the Union into a resource-efficient, green, and competitive
    low-carbon economy</li>
  <li>To safeguard the Union's citizens from environment-related pressures and
    risks to health and wellbeing </li>
</ul><h3>European Environment Agency (EEA)</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/">European Environment Agency
(EEA)</a> aims to support sustainable development and to help improve the
environment through the provision of information to policy makers and the
public. </p>

<h3>Financial support for environmental projects</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/">LIFE
2014-2020</a> is an EU co-financing programme which aims to contribute to the
development, implementation and updating of EU environment policy and
environmental legislation. LIFE also aims to facilitate the integration of the
environment into other policies, and achieve sustainable development in the EU.
The <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2013.347.01.0185.01.ENG">Regulation
governing LIFE 2014-2020 (pdf)</a> came into force in December 2013.</p>

<p>There are 2 sub-programmes: Environment and Climate Action. The Environment
sub-programme covers environment and resource efficiency; nature and
biodiversity; and environmental governance and information. Climate Action
covers climate change mitigation; climate change adaptation; and climate
governance and information. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l777ac">Access to environmental information</h2>

<p>If the information you want is not already publicly available you can use <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:041:0026:0032:EN:PDF">Directive

information (AIE) provides that individuals have the right to access certain
environmental information held by public authorities. The public authority must
respond within one month of a request. Read more in our document on <a shape="rect" href="access_to_environmental_information.html">accessing

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Pollutants in the air create a variety of dangers for health and the
environment. Air pollutants emitted directly from traffic, power generation or
industry are known as <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/health/opinions/en/indoor-air-pollution/glossary/pqrs/primary-pollutant-secondary-pollutant.htm">primary
pollutants</a>. As well as causing serious problems in their immediate
vicinity, primary pollutants can also travel long distances and can chemically
react in the atmosphere to produce secondary pollutants such as acid rain or
ozone. Certain pollutants can contribute to <a href="../environmental_law/climate_change.html">climate change</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.epa.ie/air/quality/standards">Air quality standards</a>
have been set out in EU and Irish legislation. The <a href="http://www.epa.ie/">Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a> monitors
the levels of <a href="http://www.epa.ie/air/quality/monitor/#.VMfNtYlybhk">various air
pollutants</a> against these standards.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1987/en/act/pub/0006/index.html">Air
Pollution Act 1987</a>, local authorities must take whatever measures they
consider necessary to prevent or limit air pollution in their area. The owners
of certain industrial plants must obtain an air pollution licence from their
local authority or the EPA in order to operate certain industries that will be
responsible for emissions. The EPA and local authorities have separate
licensing arrangements and you do not need to apply to both of them.</p>

<p>The role of local authorities in preventing and combating air pollution
includes:</p>
<ul><li>Monitoring of emissions or the ambient air in the area</li>
  <li>Assessing compliance with the relevant legislation</li>
  <li>Dealing with complaints with regard to air pollution</li>
  <li>Licensing certain categories of industry</li>
  <li>Enforcing the <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/Atmosphere/AirQuality/SmokyCoalBan/">ban
    on the marketing, distribution sale and burning of certain fuel</a>
    (usually bituminous coal)</li>
  <li>Organising and conducting research into the causes, extent and prevention
    of air pollution</li>
  <li>Establishing and running educational programmes about pollution and its
    prevention</li>
  <li>Supporting or assisting anyone engaged in any research, survey or
    investigation into the nature and extent, the cause and effect and the
    prevention or limitation of air pollution</li>
</ul><h3>Enforcement</h3>

<p>Local authorities have the power to enforce penalties for infringement of
the Act. Anyone found to be in breach of the Act is guilty of an offence and
can face a fine and/or imprisonment.</p>

<p>The Act places an onus on companies to use all practicable ways to limit
(and, if possible, prevent) pollution from their premises. If a local authority
considers that you are breaching the Act, it can serve a notice on you,
specifying the corrective measures you must take to prevent air pollution and
giving a time limit. While they are only responsible for enforcing the Act in
their own area, they can prosecute premises that are polluting this area, even
if the pollution is coming from a source outside of their jurisdiction.</p>

<p>If a local authority considers that you have ignored its warnings and
recommendations, it can take a case directly to the High Court. This Court can
issue an injunction, allowing the local authority to deal with the situation
immediately. This option can be used if the local authority considers that
there is a serious risk to public health or the environment.</p>

<h3>Special control areas and smoky fuel ban</h3>

<p>A local authority can declare an area to be a special control area in order
to prevent or limit air pollution. In 1990, Dublin was the first area to have a
ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous fuel. The ban has
since been extended to <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/Atmosphere/AirQuality/SmokyCoalBan/MapsofSmokyCoalBanAreas/">several
other areas</a> and now also includes the burning of such fuels.</p>

<p>All smokeless solid fuel products must be clearly labelled as "smokeless
fuel". Local authorities carry out spot checks on fuel retailers to ensure
compliance with the ban on marketing, sale and distribution of smoky fuel.</p>

<h3>Burning of waste</h3>

<p>It is illegal to burn household or garden waste, either at home or in your
garden. Read more in our document on <a href="../waste_management_and_recycling/burning_household_waste.html">burning
household waste</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lfd4ab">Integrated Pollution Control</h2>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1992/act/7/enacted/en/html">Environmental
Protection Agency Act 1992</a>, the EPA is responsible for the Integrated
Pollution Control (IPC) licensing of large or complex industries with
significant polluting potential. It is responsible for monitoring emissions
from such industries and dealing with any infringements of licence terms.
Offences under the Act can result in the EPA taking companies to court. The
court can impose fines and prison sentences and the EPA can revoke a
company’s licence.</p>

<p>The EPA will only grant a licence if it is satisfied that the licence holder
will do its utmost to prevent or limit any emissions from the plant. All
emissions must be within set limits and must not contravene any relevant air
quality standard. The <a href="http://www.epa.ie/terminalfour/ippc/index.jsp#.VPXcAYlybhk">register of
IPC licences</a> is publicly available.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>Application forms for air emissions licences are available from <a shape="rect" href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local
authority websites</a>. All air pollution data held by local authorities and
the EPA is available to the public.</p>

<p>To complain about the marketing, sale, or distribution of prohibited fuels,
or about smoky emissions from prohibited fuels in areas covered by the ban,
contact the Environment section of your local authority. Complaints about the
burning of unauthorised materials should also be reported to your local
authority.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.epa.ie/pubs/forms/lic/ipc/#.VPh-_olybhk">download an IPC
licence application form here</a>.</p>

<p>If you think that a company is breaking the terms of its IPC licence, or if
you suspect that it does not have the correct licence, you can complain to the
EPA, which will investigate the complaint and take further action, if
necessary. You also have the option to take a company to court, but this option
can be costly.</p>

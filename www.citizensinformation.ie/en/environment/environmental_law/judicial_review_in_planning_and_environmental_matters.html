<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Public decisions made by administrative bodies and the lower courts may be
judicially reviewed by the High Court. In a judicial review the court is not
concerned with the merits of the decision but rather with the lawfulness of the
decision-making process, that is, how the decision was made and the fairness of
it.</p>

<p>The basic principles of public decision-making are:</p>
<ul><li>The decision-maker must have authority to make the decision that affects
    you. If the decision-maker has the authority to make the decision, it must
    not go beyond the limits of its authority</li>
  <li>You are entitled to fair procedures in how the decision is reached. This
    means that the decision-maker must not be biased and the decision-maker
    must give you a fair hearing. You must be given an adequate opportunity to
    present your case. You must be informed of the matter and you must be given
    a chance to comment on the material put forward by the other side.</li>
  <li>The decision maker must comply with all legal requirements governing the
    decision and its making.</li>
</ul><p>If the decision-maker does not have authority or does not give you fair
procedures or does not comply with the law, you may bring judicial review
proceedings in the High Court to challenge the decision. You must show that you
have an arguable case, that is, that your case has grounds. You must also show
that you have 'sufficient interest' in the proceedings, that is, that you were
affected in some way by the decision you are challenging. Non-governmental
organisations which have been promoting environmental protection for 12 months
in respect of planning matters are not required to demonstrate a sufficient
interest.</p>

<p>The High Court will examine the decision and how it was reached and will
decide whether or not it was legal or unconstitutional. The High Court may then
quash or cancel the decision – by issuing an order known as certiorari. The
High Court can also order a decision maker, who is obliged to make a decision
but has failed or refused to do so, to actually make the decision – this is
known as an order of mandamus. An order of prohibition may also be granted in
appropriate circumstances – i.e. an order prohibiting a decision maker from
making a decision. Other orders that are available include declarations,
injunctions of an interim, interlocutory or permanent nature, or an award of
damages.</p>

<h3>Conventional and statutory review </h3>

<p>Judicial review is divided into two main categories:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Judicial review in the ordinary or conventional sense:</strong>
    This is the traditional type of judicial review developed over time by the
    judges and case law. Procedure governing conventional judicial review is to
    be found in <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/8652fb610b0b37a980256db700399507/a53b0f76ffc6c5b780256d2b0046b3dc?OpenDocument">Order
    84 of the Rules of the Superior Courts</a>. Further information on the
    procedure is available in our document: <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/judicial_review_public_decisions.html">Judicial
    review of public decisions</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Statutory judicial review:</strong> Specialised statutory schemes
    of judicial review relating to specific areas of public decision-making
    which have been singled out by the Oireachtas as warranting specialised
    schemes because of the policy concerns involved. Statutory schemes and the
    procedure involved are covered by legislation specific to that area.
    Statutory schemes apply to such areas as asylum, pollution control,
    planning and the takeover of companies. </li>
</ul><p>Statutory judicial review schemes supplement Order 84 of the Rules of the
Superior Courts with their own specific procedural rules. These statutory
schemes narrow the availability of judicial review through such features as:</p>
<ul><li>Time limits for an application for leave to bring judicial review
    proceedings are shorter</li>
  <li>Requirements to notify the decision-maker of the leave application </li>
  <li>Higher thresholds applied by the High Court when considering whether to
    allow leave, for example, substantial grounds rather than an arguable case.
  </li>
</ul></div>

<h3>Waste licensing</h3>

<p>Decisions of the Environmental Protection Agency in relation to waste
licensing under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0010/index.html">Waste
Management Act 1996</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/si/0395.html">Waste Management
(Licensing) Regulations 2004 (SI 395/2004)</a> are subject to conventional
judicial review in accordance with the provisions of Order 84 of the Rules of
the Superior Courts. </p>

<h3>Planning and Development Act consents</h3>

<p>A specific statutory procedure applies to applications for judicial review
of decisions made by the planning authorities or An Bord Pleanála. Sections 50
and 50A of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0030/index.html">Planning
and Development Act 2000</a> (as amended) set out this procedure, which differs
from that provided for in Order 84 of the Rules of the Superior Courts. In
particular the time limit for instituting a judicial review in respect of a
decision under the Planning and Development Act is 8 weeks from the date of the
decision or the doing of an act by a planning authority or the Board. This time
may be extended by the Court if it is satisfied there is good and sufficient
reason for doing so, and the circumstances that resulted in the failure to make
the application for leave within the 8 weeks were outside the control of, the
applicant for such extension.</p>

<h3>Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control licence applications</h3>

<p>Applications for judicial review in respect of the Environmental Protection
Agency in relation to Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC)
licence applications are regulated by statute. Section 87(10) of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0007/index.html">Environmental
Protection Agency Act 1992</a> (as amended) provides for judicial review or
other legal proceedings to be initiated by any person, seeking to question the
validity of a decision of the Agency to grant or refuse a licence or a revised
licence, within a period of 8 weeks. This period may be extended, on
application, by the High Court, where it considers that there is good and
sufficient reason for doing so. There is no requirement on the person
initiating these proceedings to demonstrate an interest or indicate a potential
personal impact or having a sufficient interest.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you wish to begin judicial review proceedings, you may want to contact a
<a href="../../justice/courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a> who will in
turn brief a <a href="../../justice/courtroom/barristers.html">barrister</a>
to draft the papers for the case. It is also possible for you to represent
yourself if you wish to keep your legal costs down. </p>

<p></p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l66096">Costs</h2>

<p>There is no fixed rate of charges for legal fees in Ireland. As with all
other service providers, it is advisable to obtain some quotes before deciding
on legal representation. Your solicitor must advise you in writing of the fees
you will be charged for his/her services. If it is not possible to give you a
definite sum, he/she must estimate a sum or at the very least describe the
basis upon which charges or fees will be calculated.</p>

<p>Generally in litigation the normal rule with regard to costs is that
‘costs follow the event’, i.e. the successful party is generally entitled
to his costs. Of course if you lose that means that generally you become liable
for the costs of the winning party.</p>

<p>The Planning and Development Act as amended, by way of section 50B, provides
special rules in order to comply with the Public Participation Directive and
with the <a href="aarhus_convention.html">Aarhus Convention</a>. In cases
involving the Environmental Impact Assessment, Strategic Environmental
Assessment and Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control directives, a member
of the public seeking a review of a public decision will generally not be
liable for his costs if he loses and may be entitled to his costs from the
losing party if he wins. An applicant may also be awarded his costs in cases of
exceptional importance and where it is in the interests of justice.</p>

<p>There are, however, some exemptions to this rule and an order of costs may
be awarded against a party to proceedings in certain circumstances
including:</p>
<ul><li>Where a case is deemed to be vexatious or frivolous</li>
  <li>The manner in which a party has conducted the proceedings, or</li>
  <li>If a party is in contempt of court</li>
</ul><p>In the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0020/index.html">Environment
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011</a> these rules were extended to reviews of
decisions in certain other environmental cases.</p>

<p>A list of the types of cases to which these rules apply is provided for at
<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0020/sec0004.html#sec4">section
4</a> of the Environmental (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0020/sec0007.html">Section
7</a> of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 provides for a
procedure where a person can apply to a court, prior to taking proceedings, to
determine if the case in question qualifies for the new rules on costs. This
means that an applicant can find out at an early stage what the financial risks
are likely to be if he/she proceeds with the case. If the Court does not agree
that the case falls under the new rules on costs, the applicant can reconsider
the proceedings and the associated costs risk.</p>

<p>To further reduce costs, it is open to anyone taking a case in environmental
matters to enquire from legal practitioners if they are willing to take the
case on a ‘no foal, no fee’ basis. Under such an agreement, if you win your
case you will be entitled to recover your costs from the losing side, and if
you lose your case, your legal representatives have agreed not to seek their
fees.</p>

on the court fees payable</a>.</p>

<p>The Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 also <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0020/sec0008.html">requires
that judicial notice be taken of the Aarhus Convention</a>.</p>

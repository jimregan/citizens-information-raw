<p>To ensure a level of environmental protection, the European Union and
Ireland have implemented legislation to prevent or reduce pollution of the
atmosphere, water and soil, as well as the quantities of waste arising from
industrial and agricultural installations. The law establishes a procedure for
authorising industrial and agricultural activities and sets minimum
requirements to be included in all permits, particularly in terms of pollutants
released. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31996L0061:EN:HTML">EU
Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive (Directive
96/61/EC)</a> provides for a permit system for activities including <a href="../waste_management_and_recycling/recycling_services.html">waste
management</a>. It was brought into effect in Ireland by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0027/index.html">Protection
of the Environment Act 2003</a> which amends the licensing provisions of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0007/index.html">Environmental
Protection Agency Act 1992</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0010/index.html">Waste
Management Act 1996</a>. The Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for
the Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) licensing of large or complex industries
with significant polluting potential.</p>

<p>The various activities which must have a licence to operate are listed in
the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 as amended by the Protection of
the Environment Act 2003. They include energy production, intensive
agriculture, food production, activities involving chemicals and the production
of paper. The 2003 Act adds further activities to the list which need licences
– for example, rearing of poultry and cattle slaughtering. </p>

<p>Licence holders are required to use “best available techniques” to avoid
pollution. An applicant for an IPC licence has to be a "fit and proper person".
Among other things, this means that they have not been convicted of an offence
involving the pollution control and waste legislation. The EPA has the power to
revoke or suspend IPPC licences where the "fit and proper person" requirements
are no longer met. The <a href="http://www.epa.ie/terminalfour/ippc/index.jsp#.VPXcAYlybhk">EPA maintains
a register of licences and this is publicly available</a>.</p>

<h3>Licensing procedure<br></h3>

<p>The applicant for a licence must publish a notice on the site of the
activity in question and put a notice in a newspaper of the intention to apply
and must inform the local authority. Anyone may comment in writing on the
application. When the EPA gets an application for a licence, it must tell the
relevant local authority. The Agency normally publishes such applications on
its website. When the EPA issues its proposed determination, you may <a href="http://www.epa.ie/licensing/ipc/process/object/#.VR1jwkR0yic">object</a>
within 28 days. You may ask for an <a href="http://www.epa.ie/licensing/ipc/process/oral/#.VR1j50R0yic">oral
hearing</a> but bear in mind there is a fee for such requests. The agency has
discretion on whether or not to grant an oral hearing. Any objection to the
refusal of an oral hearing or any proceedings once the decision is made, must
be taken within 8 weeks.</p>

<p>The EPA may attach a range of conditions to the licence. Theses may include
conditions on emission limits (including greenhouse gases), protection of soil
and groundwater, the efficient use of energy and what is to happen when the
activity ends. </p>

<h3>Enforcement<br></h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.epa.ie/">Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA)</a> is responsible for ensuring that the licences are enforced and
all the conditions attached are met. <br></p>

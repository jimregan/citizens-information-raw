<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) is an organism whose genetic material
has been altered either by adding or deleting certain traits. The European
Commission has developed a broad legislative framework to ensure that GMOs and
GMO-derived products that are grown, marketed and imported to the EU meet
certain safety standards. </p>

<p>The main legislation now in place is as follows:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0018:EN:HTML">Directive
    2001/18/EC</a> on the deliberate release into the environment of GMOs: this
    applies to the experimental release of GMOs into the environment and the
    placing on the market of GMOs </li>
  <li>The placing on the market of GMO food and feed or food and feed products
    containing or consisting of GMOs is regulated by <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32003R1829&amp;from=EN">Regulation
    (EC) No 1829/2003</a> on genetically modified food and feed </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R1946:EN:HTML">Regulation
    (EC) No 1946/2003</a> on transboundary movements of genetically modified
    organisms governs unintentional transboundary movements of GMOs as well as
    exports of GMOs to third countries </li>
  <li><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:31990L0219&amp;rid=2">Directive
    90/219/EEC</a>, as amended by <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31998L0081:EN:HTML">Directive
    98/81/EC</a>, on the contained use of genetically modified microorganisms
    (GMMs). This Directive regulates research and industrial work activities
    involving GMMs </li>
  <li>Labelling and traceability requirements are laid down in <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32003R1829&amp;from=EN">Regulation
    (EC) No 1829/2003</a> and <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R1830:EN:HTML">Regulation
    (EC) No 1830/2003</a> </li>
  <li><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32004R0065&amp;from=EN">Regulation
    EC 65/2004</a> on establishing a system for development &amp; assignment of
    unique identifiers for GMOs</li>
  <li>There is also a range of legislation which provides for the
    implementation of these rules. </li>
</ul><p>The GMO legislation provides that there must be an assessment of the risks
to human health and the environment <em>before</em> any GMO or product
consisting of, or containing GMOs can be released into the environment or
placed on the market. </p>

<p>The other main features of the regulation of GMOs are:</p>
<ul><li>There is a system of monitoring of GMOs after they have been put on the
    market </li>
  <li>Public information must be provided </li>
  <li>Member states must ensure labelling and traceability at all stages of the
    placing on the market. </li>

</ul><p>The <a href="https://www.fsai.ie/home.html">Food Safety Authority of Ireland
(FSAI)</a> is the competent authority for the implementation of legislation
governing genetically modified (GM) food. It ensures that only EU-authorised
genetically modified foods are allowed on the market and that they are labelled
appropriately.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/GMO/">Department of Communications,
Climate Action and Environment</a> and the <a href="http://www.epa.ie/licensing/gmo/#d.en.42858">Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA)</a> are responsible for the environmental aspects of GM
technology, including contained use, crop trials and the placing on the market
of GM crops for general cultivation purposes. </p>

<p>The seed certification division of the <a href="http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/">Department of Agriculture, Food and the
Marine (DAFM)</a> works with the EPA in respect of GM seed regulation, while
the animal feed section of DAFM regulates the importation and use of GM feed.
</p>

<p>The use of GMOs in medicines and pharmaceuticals is the responsibility of
the <a href="https://www.hpra.ie/">Health Products Regulatory Authority
(HPRA)</a>.</p>

<p>The European Commission website provides <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biotechnology/index_en.htm">information on
all aspects of GMOs,</a> their use and regulation in food and in feed.</p>

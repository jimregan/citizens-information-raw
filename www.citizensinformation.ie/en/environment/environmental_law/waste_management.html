<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>There are many different types of waste, for example, household waste,
packaging waste and electronic waste. In some cases, different types of waste
require different methods of disposal. The disposal of waste can have a
negative impact on people and the environment. For this reason, there are EU
and Irish regulations for the correct disposal of waste.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="labac0">EU waste directives </h2>

<p>The range of EU Directives dealing with waste management include the <a shape="rect" href="pollution_prevention_and_control.html">Integrated Pollution
Prevention and Control Directive (1996/61/EC)</a> as well as the following:</p>

<p><strong>Waste Framework Directive</strong></p>

<p>The Waste Framework Directive (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32008L0098">Directive
2008/98/EC</a> on waste) sets down basic requirements for handling waste and
defines what is meant by "waste". It provides that EU member states must: </p>
<ul><li>Ensure that the disposal and recovery of waste does not present a risk to
    water, air, soil, plants and animals </li>
  <li>Not allow waste disposal to constitute a public nuisance through
    excessive noise levels or unpleasant odours, or to degrade places of
    special natural interest </li>
  <li>Prohibit the dumping or uncontrolled disposal of waste </li>
  <li>Establish an integrated and effective network of waste disposal plants,
    prepare waste management plans, ensure that those who store waste handle it
    properly, and ensure that waste treatment operations are licensed </li>
  <li>Require waste collectors to have special authorisation and to keep
    records </li>
  <li>Carry out inspections of companies involved in waste collection or
    disposal </li>
  <li>Undergo periodic inspections </li>
</ul><p><strong>Hazardous waste</strong> </p>

<p>The PCB/PCT Directive (<a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31996L0059:EN:HTML">Directive
96/59/EC</a> on the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated
terphenyls) deals with the disposal of certain hazardous chemicals that
represent a particular threat to the environment and to human health. </p>

<p><strong>Sewage Sludge Directive <br></strong>The Sewage Sludge Directive (<a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31986L0278:EN:HTML">Directive
86/278/EEC</a> on the protection of the environment, and in particular of the
soil, when sewage sludge is used in agriculture) sets controls on the use of
sewage sludge in agriculture. </p>

<p><strong>Landfill Directive</strong> <br>
The Landfill Directive (<a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0031:EN:HTML">Directive
1999/31/EC</a> on the landfill of waste) sets out detailed rules on waste
landfills. It provides that the operators of existing landfill sites must have
an approved conditioning plan which indicates how the requirements of the
Directive are to be met within the required timeframe. These plans must help
prevent the negative effects of landfill on surface water, groundwater, soil
and air. The Directive also bans certain types of waste from landfill sites,
for example used tyres, and requires member states to reduce the amount of
biodegradable waste that they landfill to 35% of 1995 levels. </p>

<p><strong>Incineration of Waste Directive</strong><br>
The Directive on the incineration of waste (<a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0076:EN:HTML">Directive
2000/76/EC</a> of 4 December 2000) aims to prevent or limit the negative
effects of the incineration of waste. It imposes operational and technical
requirements and sets emission limit values for waste incineration and
co-incineration plants within the EU. </p>

<p><strong>Packaging Waste Directive</strong> <br>
The Packaging Waste Directive (<a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31994L0062:EN:HTML">Directive
94/62/EC</a> on packaging and packaging waste) sets targets for the recovery
and recycling of packaging waste and requires member states to set up
collection, recycling and recovery schemes for such waste. </p>

<p><strong>End-of-Life Vehicles Directive</strong> <br>
The End-of-Life Vehicles Directive (<a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0053:EN:HTML">Directive
2000/53/EC</a> on end-of-life vehicles) sets out measures which aim to prevent
waste from motor vehicles and vehicle components that have reached the end of
their life-cycle and to promote vehicle reuse, recycling and other forms of
recovery. It requires that collection systems be set up to ensure that
end-of-life vehicles are effectively and safely disposed of without damaging
the environment. Read more about <a href="../../travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/buying_or_selling_a_vehicle/how_to_dispose_of_an_end_of_life_vehicle.html">how
to dispose of an end-of-life vehicle.</a></p>

<p><strong>Electrical and Electronic Waste (WEEE)<br></strong>The Directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment (the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32012L0019">WEEE
Directive 2012/19/EU</a>) became effective on 14 February 2014. It aims to
prevent the generation of electrical and electronic waste and to promote reuse,
recycling and other forms of recovery in order to reduce the quantity of such
waste to be eliminated through landfilling or incineration. It requires the
collection of WEEE, recovery and reuse or recycling. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l44208">Implementation of waste directives</h2>

<p>These Directives are implemented in Ireland by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0007/index.html">Environmental
Protection Agency Act 1992</a>, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0010/index.html">Waste
Management Act 1996</a>, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0036/index.html">Waste
Management (Amendment) Act 2001</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2003/a2703.pdf">Protection
of the Environment Act 2003</a>. Several statutory instruments deal with
specific aspects of EU Directives.</p>

<p>Up to July 2016, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.environ.ie/en/">Department of the Environment, Community and
Local Government</a> had overall responsibility for waste management policy.
These functions have now been transferred to the <a href="http://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/Pages/home.aspx">Department of
Communications, Climate Action and Environment</a>. </p>

<p>Waste policy and legislation are implemented largely by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.epa.ie/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local
authorities.</a> The current waste management policy is set out in <a href="https://www.epa.ie/pubs/reports/waste/plans/Resource_Opportunity2012.pdf">A
Resource Opportunity – Waste Management Policy in Ireland (pdf),</a> which
was published in 2012. Among other things, this policy document sets out the
policy on eliminating landfill, reducing the amount of waste produced and
maximising waste as a source of products and renewable energy. </p>

<p>The Waste Management Acts provide for a general duty on everyone not to
hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is
likely to cause environmental pollution.</p>

<p><strong>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and waste<br></strong>The EPA's main activities in the waste management area are: </p>
<ul><li>Drawing up and reviewing the National Hazardous Waste Management Plan
  </li>
  <li>The integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) licensing system,
    which deals with the generation, recovery and disposal of waste </li>
  <li>Development of guidelines for the selection, management, operation and
    ending of use of landfill sites </li>
  <li>Authorisation of waste imports </li>
  <li>Maintenance of a national waste database </li>
</ul><p><strong>Local authorities<br></strong>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local
authorities</a> are responsible for:</p>
<ul><li>Authorisation and control of commercial waste collection activities </li>
  <li>Authorisation of waste exports and monitoring of internal movements of
    hazardous wastes </li>
  <li>Waste permits for small-scale recovery and disposal activities </li>
  <li>Ensuring adequate waste collection, recovery and disposal arrangements in
    their areas </li>
  <li>Monitoring and inspection of waste activities generally </li>
</ul><p><strong>Waste management plans<br></strong>The EPA is responsible for the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.epa.ie/waste/hazardous/">National Hazardous Waste Management
Plan</a>. The plan must be reviewed at least once every 5 years. </p>

<p>There are <a href="http://www.environ.ie/environment/waste/regional-waste-management-plans/regional-waste-management-plans">3
regions for the purposes of waste management planning: Southern,
Eastern-Midlands and Connacht-Ulster</a>.</p>

<p>The regional waste management plans deal with non-hazardous waste and must
include measures to:</p>
<ul><li>Prevent or minimise the production or harmful nature of waste </li>
  <li>Encourage and support the recovery of waste </li>
  <li>Ensure that the waste which cannot be prevented or recovered is disposed
    of without causing environmental pollution </li>
  <li>Ensure that the 'polluter pays' principle is effectively applied </li>
</ul><p>The region must publish a notice of its intention to draw up or review a
plan. Anyone may make a written submission within 2 months of this notice. When
the proposed plan is drawn up, it must be available for inspection and you have
2 months to make submissions about it. The plans must be reviewed at least once
every 5 years.</p>

<p><strong>Waste licences<br></strong>Certain facilities that deal with the generation, recovery and
disposal of waste require a licence from the EPA. The procedure is the same as
for the <a shape="rect" href="pollution_prevention_and_control.html">IPPC
licences</a>. The EPA keeps a <a href="http://www.epa.ie/terminalfour/waste/index.jsp">public register of waste
licences</a>.</p>

<p>Before granting a waste licence, the EPA must be satisfied, among other
things, that</p>
<ul><li>The emissions from the facility comply with the relevant standards </li>
  <li>The activity concerned will not cause environmental pollution </li>
  <li>The best available technology will be used to minimise emissions </li>
  <li>The applicant is a fit and proper person to hold a waste licence </li>
</ul><p>The local authorities operate a permit system for certain waste disposal and
recovery activities which do not require a licence from the EPA. The
application must give public notice of intention to apply for such a permit.
The application must be available for inspection at the local authority’s
offices and anyone may make a written submission about it. A permit may be
granted for up to 3 years and may have various conditions attached. The <a href="http://www.epa.ie/enforcement/wastepermit/">National Waste Collection
Permit Office (NWCPO)</a> maintains a register for waste facility permits and
certificates of registration issued by local authorities.</p>

<p><strong>Waste collection permits</strong><br>
The collection of waste on a commercial basis requires a waste collection
permit from the NWCPO. An applicant for a waste collection permit must publish
a notice of intention to apply and must give details of what is to be collected
and how this is to be done. The application may be inspected on the NWCPO
website and anyone may make a written submission on it in the 25 days after it
is made. If you make such a submission, you must be told of the NWCPO’s
decision.</p>

<p>Various conditions may be attached to the permit, including conditions
relating to the use of skips in public places. For example, it may require that
skips be lighted at night. (This may also be a requirement under bye laws
issued under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0014/index.html">Roads Act
1993</a>. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0014/sec0072.html#sec72">Section
72 of the Roads Act 1993</a> allows local authorities to make bye-laws
governing the use of skips on public roads).</p>

<p><strong>Producer responsibility obligations</strong> <br>
'Producer responsibility obligation' means a requirement to take steps for the
purpose of the prevention, minimisation, limitation or recovery of waste by the
producer of the waste. Everyone who carries on any agricultural, commercial or
industrial activity is obliged to prevent or minimise the production of waste
from that activity. Under the <a href="http://www.environ.ie/environment/waste/producer-responsibility-initiatives/producer-responsibility-initiative-model">Producer
Responsibility Initiative (PRI)</a>, as an alternative to statutory controls
and obligations, relevant business sectors were invited to formulate and
implement proposals for a voluntary producer responsibility initiative. A
review of the PRI was published in 2014. </p>

<p>There is a voluntary agreement between the Government and <a shape="rect" href="http://www.repak.ie/">Repak Ltd</a> to promote, co-ordinate and finance
the collection and recovery of packaging waste in order to achieve the
objectives set out in the Packaging Waste Directive (see above). There is an
equivalent scheme in operation for <a href="http://www.farmplastics.ie/">farm
plastics</a>. A similar scheme operates for <a href="../../travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/buying_or_selling_a_vehicle/how_to_dispose_of_an_end_of_life_vehicle.html">end-of-life
vehicles</a>.</p>

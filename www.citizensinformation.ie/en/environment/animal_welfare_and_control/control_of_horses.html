<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you own or keep a horse or similar animal, it must be microchipped and
must have an official identification document, known as a <em>horse
passport</em> – see ‘Horse identification’ below.</p>

<p>These requirements are under <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/identification/equine/index_en.htm">EU
Regulation 504/2008</a> which, along with later amendments, has been transposed
into Irish law. They apply to all members of the horse family, including
ponies, donkeys and crosses, officially known as <em>equine animals</em> but
referred to here, for clarity, as horses.</p>

<p>In addition, if you keep the horse in a <em>control area</em> designated
under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0037/index.html">Control
of Horses Act 1996</a>, you must have a horse licence for it – see ‘Control
of horses’ below.</p>

<p>You are liable for any injury or damage caused by your horse to other people
or to property.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l9021a">Horse identification</h2>

<p>There are 3 parts to the identification system for horses:</p>
<ul><li>An equine (horse) passport, which is valid for the horse’s lifetime</li>
  <li>A microchip implant, which links the animal to the passport</li>
  <li>A Unique Equine Life Number (UELN)</li>
</ul><h3>Passports</h3>

<p>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has approved a number of
organisations for the purposes of issuing identity documents for horses and
maintaining approved databases. The <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/media/migration/farmingsectors/horses/equineregistrationandpassports/ApprovalIssueEquineIdentificationDocs050916.docx">list
of these issuing bodies</a> is published on the Department’s website.</p>

<p>As well as enabling the identity of an animal to be proved, the passport
contains a declaration of whether or not the horse is intended for human
consumption. This declaration must be signed if the horse is being given
certain types of medication that render it unsuitable for the human food chain.
The owner can also choose to sign this declaration voluntarily.</p>

<p>Any horse that is born in the State must have a passport before 31 December
of the year of birth, or within 6 months of the date of birth, whichever is
later. So a horse born in May, for example, must have a passport by 31 December
of that year. A horse born in October must have a passport within 6 months –
by April of the following year.</p>

<p>In general, if a foal is leaving the holding where it was born, it must
first be microchipped (see below) and issued with a passport. However, if it is
under 6 months old, is not yet weaned and is accompanied by its dam or foster
mare, it does not need a passport.</p>

<p>Any horse being imported into the State from another EU state must be
accompanied by a valid passport. A horse being imported from outside the EU may
also already have a passport. You must register the horse’s foreign passport
with the appropriate Irish issuing body within 30 days.</p>

<p>If the horse is being imported from outside the EU and does not have a
passport, you must apply to the appropriate Irish issuing body for a passport
within 30 days.</p>

<p>The passport must accompany the horse whenever it is being moved, whether
inside the State or to somewhere else. In addition, under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/si/201/made/en/pdf">Equidae
(Change of Ownership) Regulations 2016 (pdf)</a>, when a horse changes hands,
the new owner must be given the passport and must register the change of
ownership with the appropriate issuing body.</p>

<p>When a horse dies, you should return its passport to the issuing body so
that its details on the database can be updated. If the horse has been
slaughtered, the slaughter plant will note this on the passport, which will
eventually go back to the issuing body.</p>

<h3>Microchipping and numbering</h3>

<p>In general, all horses must be microchipped. However, any horse that already
had a passport on 1 July 2009 does not need to have a microchip inserted.</p>

<p>The passport issuing bodies supply the microchips, which must be implanted
by a veterinary practitioner (a vet). The information on the microchip is
linked to the horse’s passport and to the details registered on the issuing
body’s database.</p>

<p>The horse’s Unique Equine Life Number (UELN) appears on its passport and
identifies it with the issuing body.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l0c4cf">Control of horses </h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0037/index.html">Control
of Horses Act 1996</a> allows local authorities authorities to introduce
bye-laws designating certain areas as control areas for horses. (The term
"horse" under the Act covers horses, donkeys and mules.) When the local
authority is making such bye-laws, it must follow certain procedures, including
giving details of the proposed control areas in local newspapers.</p>

<p>If you are living in a designated control area, you need a licence in order
to have a horse. A licence normally lasts for a year. The local authority keeps
a publicly available register of all licences issued.</p>

<p>When applying for a licence, you must satisfy the local authority that you
are a fit person to keep a horse and that the horse will be properly maintained
and stabled. If a person under 16 owns a horse, the head of the household in
which they live is considered to be the owner, as horses may not be sold to
anyone under 16 years of age.</p>

<p>Anyone permitted to have a horse in a public place must ensure that it is
wearing a bridle and is under adequate control. It is illegal to allow a horse
to graze, feed, stray or remain in a public place without the consent of the
local authority.</p>

<p>If you wish to ride your horse on a public road, you may do so provided that
the horse has a licence, is fitted with a bridle and is under the control of
someone over 16 years of age.</p>

<h3>Inspection and offences</h3>

<p>The Gardaí or staff authorised by the local authority may decide to inspect
your horse and you must allow them to do this. They can also ask you to produce
evidence of a horse licence. They have fairly extensive powers of search and
arrest if they suspect cruelty to horses.</p>

<p>The legislation specifies several offences, including failure to remove a
horse from a public place or control area and dangerous use of a horse. You may
be arrested without warrant for most of these offences. If convicted, you may
be fined or imprisoned (or both) and you may be disqualified from keeping a
horse for a period. The court may seize the horse and dispose of it as it sees
fit.</p>

<h3>Stray horses</h3>

<p>As well as unlicensed horses in control areas, stray or unidentifiable
horses or horses causing a nuisance or posing a danger may be seized, detained
or destroyed. If your horse has been found wandering 3 times within a 12-month
period, it can be seized and you will not get it back.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>To have a horse registered, microchipped and issued with a passport, you
will need to pay fees to the approved passport issuing body and to the vet who
implants the microchip. There may also be additional costs for DNA testing
etc.</p>

<p>Check your local authority’s website for details of its charges for horse
licences and for reclaiming a seized horse.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1986/en/act/pub/0032/index.html">Control
of Dogs Act 1986</a>, as amended by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0013/index.html">Control
of Dogs (Amendment) Act 1992</a>, local authorities are responsible for the
control of dogs. They have the power to appoint dog wardens, provide dog
shelters, seize dogs, impose on-the-spot fines and take court proceedings
against owners. </p>

<p>Local authorities may enter into agreements with each other to provide dog
wardens and dog shelters. Some local authorities may enter into agreements with
the <a href="http://www.ispca.ie/">Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals (ISPCA)</a> or, with permission from the Minister for
Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, a person or organisation connected
with animal welfare to provide these services. </p>

<p>You are liable for injury or damage caused by your dog to people or
livestock. </p>

<p>You can be disqualified from keeping a dog if you have been convicted of
cruelty to a dog under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1965/en/act/pub/0010/index.html">Protection
of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965</a>. </p>

<p>A new system of compulsory microchipping was introduced in 2015 – see
‘Dog identification’ below. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Dog licences </h3>

<p>In order to get a dog licence, you must be over 16 years of age. It is an
offence to keep a dog unless you have a licence. All dogs over 4 months of age
must have a licence. Puppies under 4 months who are still with their mothers
don't need licences, but once they leave their mothers they must have a
licence. Your dog must be accompanied by and be under your effective control or
the control of another responsible person if it is outside your home or
premises or the home or premises of the person in charge of it. A dog warden
can ask you to produce evidence of your dog licence and failure to do so can
result in an on-the-spot fine. Failure to pay this fine within a specified
period can result in prosecution by the local authority. </p>

<p>Licences are not needed for blind persons' guide dogs; for dogs in the
possession of a local authority, the ISPCA or the Gardaí; or for <span>any dog
imported into the State for less than 30 days</span>. </p>

<p>Standard annual licences for individual dogs are issued by post offices.
General dog licences for multiple dogs are issued by local authorities. The
revenue from dog licences finances the operation of dog control services.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0029/print.html#sec24">Dog
Breeding Establishments Act 2010</a> introduced a 'lifetime of dog' licence,
which is issued by local authorities. </p>

<h3>Dog identification</h3>

<p>Dogs must at all times wear a collar that bears the name and the address of
the owner inscribed on it or on a plate, badge or disc. Failure to have
identification on a dog can result in an on-the-spot fine issued by a dog
warden. Failure to pay this fine within a specific period can result in
prosecution by the local authority. </p>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/si/63/made/en/print">Microchipping
of Dogs Regulations 2015</a>, a programme of microchipping has been
introduced.</p>
<ul><li>Any pup born since 1 June 2015 must be microchipped and registered on an
    <a href="http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/media/migration/animalhealthwelfare/dogmicrochipping/Microchippingdatabases210416.pdf">authorised
    database (pdf)</a> by the time it reaches the age of 12 weeks or if it
    leaves the property on which it was born before the age of 12 weeks </li>
  <li>Since 31 March 2016, the Regulations apply to all dogs</li>
  <li>If your dog is already microchipped, you now have to register it as
  well</li>
</ul><p>Read more in <a href="http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/press/pressreleases/2016/march/title,95964,en.html">this
press release</a> and in these <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/media/migration/animalhealthwelfare/dogmicrochipping/FAQdogmicrochipping040516.pdf">Frequently
Asked Questions (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Stray dogs</h3>

<p>Stray dogs are dogs that are in a public place and are not accompanied by
the owner or a responsible person. Dogs that are not under proper control are
also considered stray dogs. You can receive an on-the-spot fine if your dog is
not under proper control. Stray dogs may be seized by the dog warden and the
Gardaí and brought to a dog pound. These dogs may be put down or re-homed if
their owners do not claim them within 5 days. If your dog has strayed or is
missing, you should contact the local dog pound directly to check if your dog
is there. Before you collect it, you will have to pay a re-claim fee and
produce a current dog licence. If you do not have a current dog licence, you
must get one before collecting your dog. </p>

<h3>Unwanted dogs</h3>

<p>Unwanted dogs should be brought to the dog pound. There may be a charge for
accepting them – check this with your local pound. Local authorities have the
power to accept unwanted dogs and put them down if they cannot be rehomed or
transferred to an animal welfare group. </p>

<h3>Dog wardens</h3>

<p>Dog wardens have the power to request the name and address of a person
suspected of an offence under the Control of Dogs Act. They also have the power
to seize and detain any dog and to enter any premises with 5 or more dogs,
other than a residence, to seize and detain a dog. You are guilty of an offence
and can be arrested by a Garda if you obstruct a dog warden in the course of
his or her work, refuse to give your name and address or give a false name and
address. </p>

<h3>Bye-laws</h3>

<p>Many local authorities have introduced bye-laws to indicate areas where dogs
must be kept on a leash or even prohibited. Your local authority will be able
to inform you of the bye-laws that apply in your area. Breaches of these
bye-laws can result in fines on summary conviction. </p>

<h3>Dog faeces</h3>

<p>Under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0012/sec0022.html#zza12y1997s22">Section
22 of the Litter Pollution Act 1997</a> it is an offence to allow a dog under
your control to foul a public place. This means the owner or person in charge
of the dog is required to remove dog faeces and dispose of them in a suitable,
sanitary manner. You can complain to the District Court under the litter laws
against an owner or someone in charge of a dog who allows that dog to foul
public places and who fails to act responsibly. Before you do this, you must
first inform the dog owner of your intention by completing a special form
available from the Dog Control Unit of your local authority. Read <a shape="rect" href="../l_protection/litter_law.html">more about litter laws</a>.
</p>

<h3>Barking dogs </h3>

<p>Excessive dog barking that causes a nuisance is an offence. You may be able
to solve such problems by talking to the dog owner.</p>

<p>If you don’t get a satisfactory response, you may complain to the District
Court and seek a hearing. When you have received a court date, you must inform
the dog owner of your complaint by using the form prescribed for this purpose
under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1986/en/act/pub/0032/sec0025.html#sec25">Section
25 of the Control of Dogs Act 1986</a>. These forms are available from the
District Courts and from <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local
authorities</a>.</p>

<p>The court may make an order requiring the occupier of the premises in which
the dog is kept to abate the nuisance by exercising due control over a dog. The
court may limit the number of dogs that can be kept on a premises or may direct
that a dog be delivered to a dog warden to be dealt with as unwanted.</p>

<h3>Guard dogs</h3>

<p>A guard dog used at a non-residential business premises must be either
accompanied by a handler or secured so that it cannot roam freely around the
premises or escape. A notice must be displayed at the entrance, informing the
public that a guard dog is on the premises. </p>

<p>The guard dog must wear a collar displaying the name and address of its
owner. It must also carry an electronic implant containing a permanent
identification mark provided by the ISPCA. This implant must be inserted by or
under the direct supervision of a veterinary surgeon authorised by the ISPCA.
The dog owner is responsible for the cost involved in inserting the implant.
</p>

<p>Kennels where more than 5 guard dogs aged over 4 months are kept must
register with the local authority. There are specific rules on the keeping of
guard dogs: the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1989/en/si/0329.html">Control of Dogs Act
1986 (Guard Dog) Regulations 1989</a>.</p>

<h3>Rules relating to certain breeds of dog</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/si/0442.html">The Control of Dogs
Regulations 1998</a> impose additional rules in relation to the following
breeds (and strains/cross-breeds) of dog:</p>

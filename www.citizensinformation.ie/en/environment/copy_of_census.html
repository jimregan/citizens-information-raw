<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Census of Population is a detailed count of every person living in the
State on a particular date, including people who are not usually resident
here.</p>

<p>It takes place every 5 years and is carried out by the <a href="http://www.cso.ie/en/index.html">Central Statistics Office (CSO)</a>. The
most recent census was taken on Sunday 24 April 2016. The previous census was
in April 2011.</p>

<p>Under Sections 26 and 27 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0021/print.html">Statistics
Act 1993</a>, there is a legal obligation to complete the census form.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l6cefc">Reasons for holding a census</h2>

<p>The Census of Population establishes the size of the population in the
State. Up-to-date population statistics are essential to help to plan for
services to meet demand for healthcare and education, for example. Detailed
figures at local level help to identify areas of high unemployment and
deprivation as well as the likely demand for local services and facilities. </p>

<p>The census also helps to provide an accurate measure of net migration (the
difference between inward and outward migration).</p>

<p>Article 16.2 of the <a href="../government_in_ireland/irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Constitution</a>
lays down that the total membership of <a href="../government_in_ireland/national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/dail_eireann.html">Dáil
Éireann</a> depends on the population as measured by the census. There must be
one TD for each 20,000 to 30,000 persons. A <a href="http://www.constituency-commission.ie/">Constituency Commission</a> must
be set up to review Dáil and European Parliament constituencies once the
preliminary results of the census have been published.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l2f26e">How the census is run</h2>

<p>Teams of enumerators deliver census forms to every household and to every
other type of place where people may be present on census night (such as
hotels, guesthouses, hospitals, ships). Everyone who is actually on the
premises in census night, including visitors, should be counted. You should
also enter the details (on List 2) of anyone who usually lives there but is
away on census night. </p>

<p>The questionnaire includes such topics as age, marital status, sex, place of
birth, occupation and industry, and housing characteristics. There is a <a href="http://census.ie/and-communities/step-by-step-filling-in-the-census-form/">step-by-step
guide to completing the form</a> on census.ie. </p>

<p>All the information that you give on the census form is confidential. The
CSO only uses it for statistical purposes. Your name and address are not
entered on any computer database, and no other organisation (including
government departments or agencies) can access information from the census that
would identify a household or a person in any way.</p>

<h3>Practical arrangements </h3>

<p>Census enumerators call to all households to deliver forms by census night
and they call back to collect completed forms over the following couple of
weeks.</p>

<p>Enumerators all carry ID, which you can ask to see if you wish. They can
help with any queries about the census form. They can also help if you have
difficulty completing the form.</p>

<p>When you have completed the form on census night, sign the declaration at
the end of the form and keep it safe until your enumerator calls back to
collect it. If nobody at all is present on census night, you should have Form E
instead of the census form. </p>

<p><strong>The 2016 census form</strong></p>

<p>You can view a <a href="http://census.ie//app/uploads/2016/02/65995-English-Household_2016-New-Version-Do-Not-Complete.pdf">sample
copy of the census form (pdf)</a> and a <a href="http://census.ie//the-census-and-you/each-question-in-detail/">list of
the questions, together with detailed explanations</a>. There were no new
questions in 2016, but the question on marital status was updated to include
registered same-sex civil partnerships. </p>

<p>As well as English and <a href="http://census.ie//app/uploads/2016/02/65996-Irish-Household-2016-NEW-Version-Do-Not-complete.pdf">Irish
(pdf)</a> versions, the main text of the form is available in <a href="http://census.ie/the-census-and-you/foreign-languages/">several foreign
languages</a>.</p>

<p>The form is also available in <a href="http://census.ie/app/uploads/2016/01/PR-101667-Large-Print-Household-Form-2016-updated.pdf">large
print (pdf)</a> and in <a href="http://census.ie/and-communities/accessibility/">MP3 format</a>. Braille
and CD versions are available on request.</p>

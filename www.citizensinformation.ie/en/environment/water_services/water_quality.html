<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>This document deals with the quality of water that is provided for human
consumption – drinking, preparing food, making ice, making drinks with water
and brushing teeth. For regulation purposes, this is called ‘drinking
water’.</p>

<p>Drinking water comes from two different sources. Water from lakes, rivers
and streams (surface water) will almost certainly have to be treated to make it
safe to drink. Water from springs and boreholes (groundwater) may have to be
treated, depending on the quality of its source. </p>

<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publishes <a href="http://www.epa.ie/water/dw/">information on drinking water quality</a>
and the Health Service Executive (HSE) publishes <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/health/hl/water/drinkingwater/">information about
drinking water and health issues</a>. Irish Water has published <a href="http://www.water.ie/help-centre/questions-and-answers/">FAQs on water
quality</a>. </p>

<p>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland publishes <a href="https://www.fsai.ie/faq/bottled_water.html">information on bottled
water</a>. The EPA publishes <a href="http://www.epa.ie/water/wm/bathing/">information on bathing water</a>.

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l3da0c">Lead and drinking water</h2>

<p>Lead can be present in drinking water, as lead piping, lead solder and
lead-lined water tanks were commonly used in plumbing up to and including the
1970s, so some people may still be getting water through these older plumbing
systems. Lead is a danger to health, especially for young children, pregnant
women and babies fed on formula, so water for drinking and cooking should
contain as little lead as possible. The legal level of lead in drinking water
is <strong>10 micrograms per litre</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are concerned that there might be lead in your drinking water, you
can contact Irish Water for advice – see ‘Contacts’ below. If your water
is not provided by Irish Water, contact your group scheme or your local
authority.</p>

<p>A new grant scheme has been set up to help low-income households with the
cost of remediating domestic lead piping. <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/Water/WaterQuality/LeadinDrinkingWater/">Details
of the scheme</a> are on environ.ie, along with a combined <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Environment/Water/FileDownLoad,44180,en.pdf">information
note and application form (pdf)</a>. </p>

<p>The HSE has published a <a href="https://www.epa.ie/pubs/advice/drinkingwater/7523%20%20-%20epa%20Drinking%20Water%20Report%20WEB.pdf">joint
position paper on lead in drinking water (pdf)</a> with the EPA, along with a
<a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/health/hl/water/drinkingwater/lead/">set of
FAQs</a>. A national <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/Water/WaterSectorReform/News/MainBody,41734,en.htm">strategy
to reduce lead exposure</a> has been published and Irish Water is preparing a

mitigation plan</a>. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lb9498">Other factors affecting water quality</h2>

<p>Several factors can affect the quality of drinking water sources (raw
water). If there is high rainfall, for example, extra organic material may be
washed into rivers and streams. Water treatment plants need to be able to deal
with this. If rainfall is low, these sources can dry up altogether. Other
factors affecting water sources include agricultural practices and the type of
soil and underlying ground.</p>

<p>Factors affecting treated drinking water (finished water) include breakdown
in the treatment process; lack of disinfection and filtration (or problems with
them); problems with equipment; power outages or dirt in distribution pipes.
Sometimes, poor quality is due to the water being drawn from an unsuitable
source and the best solution is finding an alternative source.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="http://www.askaboutireland.ie/enfo/irelands-environment/water/water-pollution/">information
about water pollution on the ENFO website</a>.</p>

<h3>Contaminated water </h3>

<p>As well as the effects of lead (see above) infectious diseases caused by
bacteria (like E Coli - also known as VTEC) and parasites (like <a href="http://www.hpsc.ie/A-Z/Gastroenteric/Cryptosporidiosis/Publications/File,14628,en.pdf">Cryptosporidium
(pdf)</a>) are the most significant health risks associated with contaminated
drinking water. These contaminants are of particular danger to children, older
people, pregnant women and people whose immune systems are compromised. A
change in the colour, taste or smell of water can indicate a problem. However,
such changes are not always present, even if the water is contaminated. </p>

<p><strong>Septic tanks:</strong> Leakage from septic tanks or other domestic
waste water treatment systems can contaminate drinking water - see <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Environment/Water/FileDownLoad,33589,en.pdf">Is
your well at risk from your septic tank? (pdf)</a>. All domestic waste water
treatment systems, including septic tanks, must be registered and an inspection
system is in place. The owner of the system must ensure that any necessary
remediation is carried out, following inspection.</p>

<p>Read more in our document on <a href="../../housing/owning_a_home/home_owners/domestic_wastewater_treatment.html">inspection
of septic tanks and other domestic waste water treatment systems</a> and in the
EPA's <a href="http://www.epa.ie/whatwedo/advice/wastewater/legislation/faq/">Frequently
Asked Questions</a>.</p>

<h3>Treatment of drinking water</h3>

<p>Most water supplies need to be treated to bring them up to the standards
required – see <a href="water_quality.en.html#lc721e">Standards and
monitoring</a> below. Groundwater can be of high quality but this depends on
the soil and rock formation and on the agricultural practices near the source.
It may only need precautionary disinfection. Surface waters almost always
contain impurities and these have to be removed by a suitable treatment
process, including coagulation, filtration and chlorination.</p>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/si/0042.html">Fluoridation of
Water Supplies Regulations 2007 (SI 42/2007)</a> fluoride is added to the water
in all public supplies. There is <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/Publications/HealthProtection/Public_Health_/Flouride_and_Public_Health.pdf">information
about fluorides and public health (pdf)</a> on the HSE’s website.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lc721e">Standards and monitoring </h2>

<p>All water for human consumption must be free from micro-organisms and any
substances which, if found in sufficient numbers or concentrations, would
endanger public health. These standards are contained in the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/si/122/made/en/print">European
Union (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014</a>. </p>

<p>These Regulations give formal effect in Irish law to the EU Drinking Water
Directive of 1988. They establish strict quality standards for water used for
human consumption and set out the maximum and guideline values for various
different physical, bacteriological and chemical contaminants. Not all of these
parameters are monitored at the same frequency. A group of 8 to 14 contaminants
are monitored regularly and others are monitored at set times, based on the
size of the supply.</p>

<p>The EPA has published detailed handbooks on the implementation of the
Regulations in <a href="http://www.epa.ie/pubs/advice/drinkingwater/privatewatersupplieshandbook/#.UsbqqImYbhk">private
water supplies</a> and <a href="http://www.epa.ie/pubs/advice/drinkingwater/publicwatersupplieshandbook/">public
water supplies</a>.</p>

<h3>Monitoring of drinking water supplies</h3>

<p>How water supplies are monitored for adherence to the standards set out in
the Regulations depends on their size and on whether or not they supply water
to the public.</p>

<p>Large supplies (supplying more than 50 people or producing more than 10
cubic metres of water a day) and small supplies that provide water to the
public (such as businesses, schools or social clubs) must meet the standards
and they are monitored under the Regulations.</p>

<p>The EPA’s <a href="http://www.epa.ie/pubs/reports/water/drinking/">drinking water
reports</a> show that the quality of water in regulated water supplies is high.
</p>

<p>Small water supplies (supplying fewer than 50 people or producing less than
10 cubic metres of water a day) and supplies with no public activity should
also meet the legal standards, but they are not monitored under the
Regulations. It is up to the owner of the supply to make sure that they meet
the standards. At present, over 10% of consumers in Ireland get their drinking
water from such unregulated supplies, the quality of which is not officially
monitored.</p>

<h3>Public water supplies</h3>

<p>The EPA is the supervisory authority for public water supplies. Irish Water
is responsible for monitoring such supplies and for informing the EPA of
non-compliant water monitoring results. The relevant local authority prepares
short-term and long-term plans to address the problem, for approval by the EPA.
The EPA has legal enforcement powers if appropriate action is not taken.</p>

<h3>Private water supplies</h3>

<p>Private water supplies include private group water schemes, public group
water schemes and other private supplies such as a water supply owned by a
developer. This category also includes small supplies that provide water to the
public.</p>

<p>A <strong>private</strong> group water scheme is one where the entire water
supply (including the source, treatment plant and distribution network) is
owned by a group of community trustees. These are commonly members of the <a href="http://www.nfgws.ie/Home">National Federation of Group Water Schemes</a>.
A <strong>public</strong> group water scheme is where the water comes from a
public drinking water supply but the distribution system is owned by a group
water scheme.</p>

<p>Local authorities often monitor private supplies on behalf of their owners
or trustees. Some of them employ the HSE to test the water quality and some do
it themselves. The trustees or owners of the supply pay the local authority for
this service.</p>

<p>In the case of private supplies, the local authority is the supervisory
authority. They have the same role that the EPA has for public supplies. If a
private water supply falls below the EC standards, the local authority notifies
the trustees of the scheme or the owners. The trustees or owners must submit an
action programme to the local authority which will address the problem within a
certain timescale. The local authority has legal enforcement powers if
appropriate action is not taken.</p>

<p>For all regulated water supplies, public and private, the HSE is informed if
there is a potential danger to human health and agrees remedial actions with
the local authority for the protection of public health.</p>

<h3>Monitoring of small water schemes and wells</h3>

<p>As noted above, for group water schemes that do not supply more than 50
people or produce more than 10 cubic metres of water per day, the same
standards apply but the quality is not monitored under the Regulations. Whoever
is responsible for the scheme is responsible for monitoring the water
quality.</p>

<p>Similarly, if your water supply comes from a private well, you are
responsible for monitoring the quality of your own supply. You must bear the
cost of the testing yourself and if your supply is contaminated, you must
organise and pay for any treatment that is needed.</p>

<p>The HSE publishes <a href="http://www.lenus.ie/hse/bitstream/10147/294332/2/A4_Precautions%20and%20advice%20for%20reducing%20risk%20of%20illness%20from%20well%20water.pdf">detailed
information on the risk of illness from well water (pdf)</a>. It recommends
that wells should be tested at least once a year for microbial contamination,
and at least once every 3 years for chemical contamination. It also publishes
information on the <a href="http://www.lenus.ie/hse/bitstream/10147/281381/7/SwitchingfromPublictoPrivateDrinkingWaterSuppliesHSEDGroupFeb2011.pdf">risks
of switching from a public to a private water supply (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>To get your supply checked, contact the local authority or HSE Environmental
Health Officer in the first instance. Alternatively, you can arrange to have a
sample tested using a private laboratory. It is not recommended that you take a
water sample yourself as equipment has to be sterile.</p>

<p>The EPA has published <a href="http://www.epa.ie/water/dw/hhinfo/">extensive
information for householders</a> on protecting private wells, including an <a href="http://erc.epa.ie/water/wells/#.U5B0wYlOXhk">online tool for assessing
whether your well is at risk</a>. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l4a2bd">Enforcement of standards</h2>

<p>The EPA is the supervisory authority for <strong>public</strong> water
supplies and the local authority is the supervisory authority for
<strong>private</strong> supplies. This means that they can legally enforce the
standards set out in the Regulations if agreed actions on a regulated water
supply have not been taken within the agreed timescale.</p>

<p>A notice (a Direction) can be served (by the EPA on Irish Water or by the
local authority on private owners or trustees) to prepare an action programme
that will bring the supply up to the necessary standard as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Owners and trustees of private supplies must prepare their action programme
in consultation with the local authority.</p>

<p>For group water schemes, it must fit in with the county’s strategic rural
water plan under the Rural Water Programme, outlined below. Advice can be
obtained from the <a href="http://www.nfgws.ie/Home">National Federation of
Group Water Schemes</a>. </p>

<p>The owners or trustees must submit the programme to the local authority
within 2 months of receiving the notice. It should contain the following
information:</p>
<ul><li>A description of the quality issues to be dealt with</li>
  <li>Details of the changes put forward to bring the water supply up to
    drinking water standards</li>
  <li>Whether a capital grant under the Rural Water Scheme is needed</li>
  <li>A timeframe for the achievement of drinking water standards</li>
  <li>Details of the management or operational changes that may have been made
    to bring the scheme into compliance with drinking water standards.</li>
</ul><p>If the programme is not produced within 2 months, the person on whom the
notice was served is guilty of an offence under the Regulations. On summary
conviction in a District Court, they could be liable to a fine and/or a prison
sentence.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="ld46a5">Agencies involved with water
quality</h2>

<p>Various public agencies have important roles to play, as follows:</p>

<h3>Irish Water and local authorities</h3>

<p>Irish Water is responsible for maintaining the public water supplies and
ensuring the quality of the water it distributes. Local authorities are the
supervisory authority for the water quality of private water supplies that are
monitored under the Regulations. They also perform certain functions on behalf
of Irish Water under service level agreements. See our document on <a href="water_supply.html">Water supply</a>.</p>

<p>If a water supply constitutes a danger to human health, Irish Water must
take action to protect public health. It does this in consultation with and
with the agreement of the HSE. It may issue a ‘Drinking Water Restriction
Notice’. Alternatively it may issue a ‘Boil Water Notice’, warning that
the water supply is not safe for human consumption unless boiled first. It must
ensure that the public are made aware of the dangers as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If you get your water from the public mains system and have doubts about its
quality, this may be due to deficiencies in your own plumbing system. If so,
you are responsible for fixing the problem. A group water scheme that gets its
water from the public mains system is also responsible for maintaining its own
equipment.</p>

<p>However, if the problem is with the public mains system, this is the
responsibility of Irish Water, which works with local authorities to respond to
emergencies relating to water mains leaks and pollution incidents. </p>

<h3>Rural Water Programme and monitoring committees</h3>

<p>The local authorities administer the <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/Water/WaterServices/RuralWaterProgramme/">Rural
Water Programme</a>, which aims to improve the quality and efficiency of group
water schemes, small public water and sewerage schemes, and private supplies
where no alternative group or public supply is available.</p>

<p>Each county has a strategic rural water plan, pinpointing areas needing
improvement and deciding how to make the most of grants and subsidies available
for improving and maintaining water supply systems. Local authorities have
compiled an inventory of group schemes and take note of the quality of their
water supply. The overall aim of the plan must be to deliver water as
efficiently and effectively as possible.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/Water/WaterServices/RuralWaterProgramme/#National%20Rural%20Water%20Services%20Committee">National
Rural Water Services Committee</a> monitors and advises on the development and
implementation of policy on the Rural Water Programme. There are local
committees in each county to enable water consumers to have a say in how the
Programme is implemented. Each local authority has a County Liaison Officer to
deal with day-to-day issues brought up by the Programme’s implementation.</p>

<h3>Health Service Executive (HSE)</h3>

<p>Under the Regulations, the HSE must be informed whenever poor water quality
poses a potential danger to human health. The local authority then prepares an
action programme in consultation with and with the agreement of the HSE.</p>

<p>In some areas, the Environmental Health section in the Local Health Office
monitors water supplies on behalf of the local authority to make sure that all
water sources meet the required public health standards. The HSE is also
responsible for monitoring the fluoride content of public water supplies.</p>

<p>The HSE can also (for a fee) analyse water from a private source, such as a
well. The fee cannot be more than the cost of the monitoring.</p>

<p>As noted above, the HSE also publishes <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/health/hl/water/drinkingwater/">advice and
guidance</a> on the dangers to human health caused by poor water quality.</p>

<h3>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</h3>

<p>The EPA collects information from Irish Water about the monitoring of
regulated water supply schemes and produces a <a href="http://www.epa.ie/pubs/reports/water/drinking/">yearly report on the
quality of drinking water in Ireland</a>. It has enforcement powers in relation
to the drinking water quality of public water supplies. These powers require
Irish Water to notify the EPA (as well as the HSE) where there is a potential
risk to human health and to comply with their directions.</p>

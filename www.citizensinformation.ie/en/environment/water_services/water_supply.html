<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Since 1 January 2014, responsibility for the efficient supply of water to
homes and businesses has transferred from local authorities to Irish Water, the
new national water services authority. Funding for maintaining and improving
the water supply infrastructure (pipes, filtration and disinfection systems)
comes from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.</p>

<p><strong>New arrangements for public water supply</strong></p>

<p>The new system is being brought into effect under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/act/pub/0006/index.html">Water
Services Act 2013</a> and the <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=24954&amp;&amp;CatID=59">Water
Services (No. 2) Act 2013</a>, as follows:</p>
<ul><li>On 1 January 2014, Irish Water assumed responsibility for water and
    wastewater services to homes and businesses connected to a public water
    supply</li>
  <li>Local authorities will now provide certain services on behalf of Irish
    Water through a Service Level Agreement</li>
  <li>Water services assets and liabilities are being transferred from local
    authorities to Irish Water on a phased basis </li>
  <li>The Commission for Energy Regulation is now the economic regulator of the
    water sector</li>
  <li>Domestic water charges will begin from 1 January 2015, with households
    receiving their first bills from April 2015</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.water.ie/billing-and-metering/metering-explained/">Water
    meters</a> are being installed at present</li>
</ul><p>Further information on the new system is available on <a href="http://www.water.ie/">www.water.ie</a>, from the <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/Water/WaterSectorReform/">Department
of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government</a>, and in <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/Water/WaterServices/News/MainBody,34963,en.htm">this
press release</a>. </p>

<p>The rest of this document describes the current system of water supply.</p>

<h3>Public water schemes</h3>

<p>Public water mains are administered and maintained by local authorities.
This water is supplied to homes and businesses in urban areas. At present,
charges are only levied on water supplied to commercial premises. The
Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government funds the
provision and upgrading of capital projects in water and wastewater services.
Local authorities administer the actual building of public water supply
projects. Stringent water testing is carried out on all public waters by local
authorities and the Health Service Executive (HSE). </p>

<h3>Group water schemes</h3>

<p>Many households that are not connected to a public water supply are served
by group water schemes. These schemes are formed by two or more households
coming together to provide their own common water supply. The group elects
trustees to act on behalf of its members in all dealings with the local
authority.</p>

<p>Usually, group schemes are established in areas where the local authority
does not intend to install a water supply system in the near future, or at all.
Group water schemes can get water supplies from the public mains, if possible,
or a private source like wells or lakes. </p>

<p>You have to pay for your water if you belong to a private group water
scheme. However, local authorities do provide subsidies for each house in a
group scheme – see <a href="water_supply.en.html#l62fd2">Rates</a> below.
Local authorities have the remit to test the water supply and ensure it is safe
to drink but they are not responsible for maintaining group scheme pipes and
filtration systems.</p>

<p>If the members of a group water scheme want the local authority to take over
the running of the scheme, they must sign a waiver to allow local authority
personnel on their land to maintain pipes, etc. The group must give the local
authority a map of the pipe system and give it access to test pipes for
leakage. If the local authority takes over the scheme, it is then responsible
for maintaining the water system. However, if a group water scheme remains
fully private, it may get technical and grant assistance from the local
authority for any necessary upgrading works.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nfgws.ie/Home">National Federation of Group Water
Schemes</a> is a co-operative society, established to represent the interests
of members of group water schemes. It also provides advisory, training,
developmental and other services to scheme members.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Private water supplies (groundwater)</h3>

<p>If you are not part of a water supply scheme (public or group), you will
have to consider boring your own well and drawing out groundwater to supply
your needs. The Institute of Geologists of Ireland (IGI) has prepared <a href="http://www.igi.ie/publications/codes-guidelines.htm">guidelines for
drilling private wells</a>. </p>

<p>When the well is drilled, you should seal it against pollution, make sure it
is disinfected and get a sample tested. See the IGI’s <a href="http://www.igi.ie/assets/files/Water%20Well%20Guidelines/Guidelines.pdf">guidelines
on Water well construction (pdf)</a> for further detail. If your water supply
has been polluted by negligence, you should contact your local authority. It
can prosecute those responsible under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1977/en/act/pub/0001/index.html">Local
Government (Water Pollution Act) 1977</a>. </p>

<h3>Ensuring water quality</h3>

<p>For further information on how the quality of both public and private water
supplies is ensured, see <a href="water_quality.html">our document on water
quality</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l99539">Water conservation</h2>

<p>The Water Services Act 2007 provides for the conservation of water where
leakage occurs due to unrepaired pipes or equipment, or where poor management
results in wastage or excessive consumption of water. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Legislation/Environment/Water/FileDownLoad,19123,en.pdf">Regulations
made under the Act (pdf)</a> also apply to water restrictions in times of water
shortages. A local authority can make an order to stop or restrict the use of
water supplies for:</p>
<ul><li>Watering gardens, recreational parks or sports grounds </li>
  <li>Washing cars and trailers (including by commercial car wash facilities)
  </li>
  <li>Filling or replenishing swimming pools, ponds and lakes </li>
  <li>Irrigating or spraying crops. </li>
</ul><p>It is an offence not to comply with a water conservation order.</p>

<h3>Individual Supply Grant Scheme</h3>

<p>Under this scheme, if your house is more than 7 years old and not connected
to either a public or a group scheme, you may be eligible for a grant (subject
to some conditions). The grant is worth up to €2,031.58 (or 75% of the cost
of the work, whichever is the lesser) and must be used to provide a new water
supply or to upgrade an existing one. Only one grant per house will be allowed
in any 10-year period. In order to qualify for the grant, the proposed work
must cost more than €635. A local authority inspection will be carried out
before any work starts.</p>

<p>The kind of work that would be eligible for the grant is the drilling of a
new well or the provision of essential pumping or water filtration/disinfection
equipment.</p>

<p>For more details and application forms, apply to your local authority.</p>

<h3>Group Water Grant Scheme</h3>

<p>Grants are available from the local authority if 2 or more householders get
together to provide their homes and farms with a water system where none
exists. A committee that represents the scheme members must propose the scheme
and the local authority must approve it. The amount of grant payable depends on
where the scheme is located. Check with your local authority for details of
your area. Generally, a grant will cover 85% of the cost, with a limit of
€6,475 for each house in the scheme. The group members must cover the
balance, but costs can be kept down if members can do some of the work
themselves.</p>

<p>An annual subsidy is available for the running costs of the group water
scheme. This must be approved by the local authority. The amount of subsidy is
100% of the qualifying expenditure up to the following limits:</p>
<ul><li>€70 for each house supplied from a from a local authority source
    (public mains) </li>
  <li>€140 for each house supplied from a private source (such as a private
    well) </li>
  <li>Where a group scheme has provided its own water treatment plant under a
    Design, Build, Operate (DBO) contract, a new subsidy will be paid to cover
    the full production cost of treated water for domestic use. </li>
</ul><p>These procedures will be updated when the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/act/pub/0030/index.html">Water
Services Act 2007</a> is fully in force.</p>

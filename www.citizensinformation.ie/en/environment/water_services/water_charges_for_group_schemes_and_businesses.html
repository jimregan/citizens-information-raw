<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>This document outlines how group schemes and businesses pay for their
water.</p>

<p>Commercial water charges are levied on all businesses and must be paid to
the local authority. If you are in a group water scheme, you may have to pay a
certain amount for your domestic water.</p>

<p>Following the introduction of <a href="water_charges.html">domestic water
charges</a>, the current State subvention of group water schemes will be
adjusted to align it with the free allowance approach for households on public
water supplies. The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local
Government will consult with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes on
arrangements for the group water sector.</p>

<p>Revenue from water charges is used to maintain and improve the water and
wastewater systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f94e">Commercial water charges</h2>

<p>All commercial organisations must pay water charges if water is being
supplied for their use. Hospitals, sanatoriums, homes for people with mental or
physical disabilities, maternity homes, convalescent homes, laboratories,
clinics, health centres, schools and clubs also pay water charges. There are
two types of commercial water charges. You can either pay a flat rate or your
water usage can be monitored using a meter.</p>

<h3>Metered accounts</h3>

<p>A metered account involves a meter being fitted to monitor commercial water
usage. Commercial metered accounts are subject to a minimum charge per year as
well as a rental charge for the meter itself. The rental charge is usually paid
on a quarterly basis. The minimum charge can vary in different local authority
areas.</p>

<p>A domestic allowance is available where the water supply is used jointly for
domestic and commercial use. The domestic allowance can vary between local
authorities. To apply for this allowance, contact your local authority.</p>

<p>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is the economic regulator
for the water sector, will make a determination on non-domestic tariff
structures, including mixed-use premises (a property with a business and a
household) in 2014 and is expected to apply the principle of equity for all
customers with a domestic supply.</p>

<h3>Flat-rate assessed commercial charges</h3>

<p>This flat-rate charge is payable to the local authority. The rate is
calculated by estimating how much water (and waste water) your business uses.
The volume of water and waste water will differ, depending on the type of
business and the number of employees. For example, a newsagent will be charged
less than a hairdresser because it uses less water. There is no minimum charge
set down in legislation. Each local authority can set its own rates, which are
reviewed every year. Some local authorities set fixed water and wastewater
tariffs that apply to all unmetered commercial properties.</p>

<p>Irish Water has confirmed that <a href="http://www.water.ie/business/pricing/">commercial water charges will not
change in 2014</a>. Read more <a href="http://www.water.ie/business/irish-water-for-business/">information for
business customers on water.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>Mixed-use premises</h3>

<p>The CER plans to make a determination on non-domestic tariff structures,
including mixed-use premises (a property with a business and a household) in
2014 and is expected to apply the principle of equity for all customers with a
domestic supply. This is in accordance with the ‘polluter pays’ principle
and the requirements of Article 9 of the EU Water Framework Directive.</p>

<p>The CER will publish a timeline for establishing a new tariff framework by
the end of 2014.</p>

<p>It has decided the following arrangements for mixed-use premises – that
is, a property with a business and a household:</p>
<ul><li>That the <strong>domestic</strong> component of usage will be charged on
    the same assessed basis as other assessed domestic customers, with the same
    free allowances applying per household and per child, regardless of whether
    a mixed-use premises has a domestic meter. A separate account will be set
    up for the domestic water charges and the bills will issue separately.</li>
  <li>For metered non-domestic customers in mixed-use premises, that the
    <strong>non-domestic</strong> component of water usage will be charged at
    the relevant non-domestic rate on usage in excess of the current local
    authority domestic allowance</li>
  <li>For unmetered non-domestic customers in mixed-use premises, that the
    <strong>non-domestic</strong> component of water charges will be charged at
    the relevant non-domestic assessed charge, less the value of the current
    local authority domestic allowance</li>
</ul></div>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l5efa2">Group water schemes</h2>

<p>Group water schemes operate in rural areas, outside the scope of urban
public mains systems. They can be public or private, depending on whether the
water comes from the public mains or a private source. All group schemes are
fitted with a water meter so the local authority can monitor the amount of
water used. Each household gets a domestic allowance of 225 cubic metres.
Domestic users rarely exceed this amount. If they do, the group scheme is
charged as a whole, as the meter monitors the water use of the whole scheme.
The meter is checked on a quarterly basis and the allowances for domestic users
are deducted. The remainder is charged at a set rate per cubic metre. This rate
varies from one local authority to another.</p>

<p>Group scheme members are entitled to a subsidy from the local authority. The
members of the scheme must meet any additional costs, such as filtration
systems and disinfection.</p>

<p>Commercial premises (like farms or other rural businesses) that are members
of group schemes are treated differently from private homes. They get a
domestic allowance to cover their domestic water usage. In most cases, they
have a water meter to monitor the amount used. The standard domestic allowance
is then deducted from the total to determine how much water was used by the
business. Alternatively, a fixed rate could be agreed and the business owner
pays this amount. If the business owner is in a private group scheme, the
amount to be paid must be decided by the other members and the trustees. If the
owner is in a public scheme, it is the responsibility of the local authority to
monitor the water usage and charge the owner accordingly.</p>

<h3>Charges for public group water schemes</h3>

<p>As a member of a public group scheme, you get your water from the public
mains system. If you are a domestic user, you do not have to pay water charges.
Commercial users like farms or businesses have to pay for the water they use in
the running of their businesses. Their water use is monitored and the local
authority charges them the set commercial rate.</p>

<h3>Charges for private group water schemes</h3>

<p>Domestic users have to pay for water if they are in a private group scheme,
where water comes from a private source such as a well or lake. Local
authorities provide a subsidy for each house in a private group scheme just as
they do for public scheme members. However, the subsidy for a private group
scheme is higher to reflect the increased costs associated with a private water
supply, such as filtration and disinfection costs. Commercial water users who
are members of a private scheme can either have a meter fixed to their premises
to monitor their water usage or they can agree a fixed rate with other group
members.</p>

<h2 class="further_info" id="laafc7">Private wells</h2>

<p>If you sink your own well, you are not liable for water charges. You are
entitled to a grant for the drilling of the well. However, the grant may not
cover the full costs of the drilling or any further costs you may run into, for
example, filtration. Your water must be tested for pollutants before you can
use it. Read more in our document on <a href="water_quality.html">water
quality</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic further_info">
<h2 class="further_info" id="lf6610">Paying water charges - current system</h2>

<p>All <strong>commercial premises</strong>, unless a personal hardship waiver
applies, must pay their water charges. If you do not pay, the local authority
can take you to the District Court to recover the charges from you.
Alternatively, it can disconnect your water supply. This is rarely done because
of implications for health and safety.</p>

<p>Water that is supplied on a fixed-rate basis must be paid for in advance.
The charges are broken into 2 equal instalments, due on 1 April and 1 October
each year. If the charges are not paid within 2 months, the local authority can
take the consumer to court to recover them.</p>

<p>If the charges remain unpaid after 2 months, the local authority can
discontinue the water supply to the premises. The cost of disconnection can be
awarded to the local authority by a District Court. The cost of reconnection is
the responsibility of the user.</p>

<p>Revenue collectors collect water charges on behalf of the local authorities,
which act as agents for Irish Water. Payments can be made directly to the
revenue collector or to the local authority in person, by post, by standing
order, bank giro or direct debit.</p>

<p>If you are unable to pay your water charges, you can apply to the local
authority for a waiver. Application forms are available from your local
authority.</p>

<p><strong>Group water schemes</strong> are responsible for monitoring
themselves. Members of group schemes who do not pay their share of the
maintenance costs must be dealt with by the group and its trustees. The local
authority cannot get involved as it has no authority over the scheme. It is up
to the members and trustees of group schemes to decide who should pay what and
the grounds on which charges can be waived or reduced.</p>

<p>If you are in a private group scheme, you must discuss any difficulties
regarding payment with the trustees of the group.</p>

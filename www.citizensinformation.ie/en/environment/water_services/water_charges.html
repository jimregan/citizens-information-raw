<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Domestic water charges were introduced in 2015 for homes that are connected
to a public water supply or to public wastewater services. Irish Water, the
national water utility, administers the water charges. </p>

<h3>Recent developments</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=33197&amp;&amp;CatID=59">Water
Services (Amendment) Bill 2016</a> is currently going through the Oireachtas.
The Bill and proposed amendments aim to:</p>
<ul><li>Suspend domestic water charges for 9 months, from 1 July 2016 to 31 March
    2017, with no charging or billing of domestic customers during that
  period</li>
  <li>Suspend issuing of domestic water bills for the second quarter of 2016,
    which had been due to issue in the third quarter of 2016</li>
</ul><p>An <a href="http://www.environ.ie/water/water-services/policy/establishment-expert-commission-domestic-public-water-services">expert
commission</a> has been established to make recommendations on a sustainable
long-term funding model for domestic water and wastewater services. An
Oireachtas committee will then consider these recommendations and develop its
own recommendations. The Oireachtas is expected to vote on the committee’s
recommendations by end March 2017.</p>

<p>The 9-month period of suspension may be extended if the Oireachtas committee
requests more time to complete its work or if the Government needs more time to
consider the Oireachtas committee’s recommendations.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/extra_social_welfare_benefits/water_conservation_grant.html">Water
Conservation Grant</a> has been suspended for 2016. Applications for the Water
Conservation Grant 2015 are now closed.</p>

<h3>Legislation and previous changes</h3>

<p>The system of domestic water charges was introduced under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2013/act/50/enacted/en/html">Water
Services (No. 2) Act 2013</a>. Related legislation is published on <a href="http://www.environ.ie/water/water-services/other/legislation">environ.ie</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0044/print.html">Water
Services Act 2014</a> brought in several revisions to the system, including
caps on annual charges, a Water Conservation Grant of €100 per year and a
statutory dispute resolution system.</p>

<p>The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government published
the <a href="http://www.environ.ie/sites/default/files/migrated-files/en/Publications/Environment/Water/FileDownLoad,39548,en.pdf">key
elements of these revisions (pdf)</a> and a set of <a href="http://www.environ.ie/sites/default/files/migrated-files/en/Publications/Environment/Water/FileDownLoad,39547,en.pdf">detailed
FAQs (pdf)</a>. </p>

<h3>Fixing of leaks</h3>

<p>Homeowners are legally responsible for water pipes and systems inside their
dwelling and between the dwelling and the property boundary. This means that
you would normally need to pay a plumber to fix a leak, whether it is inside
your home or on the external supply pipe between your home and the property
boundary. You can use Irish Water’s <a href="http://www.water.ie/water-supply/first-fix/checking-for-leaks/">checklist
to see if you have any internal leaks</a>.</p>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.water.ie/water-supply/first-fix/">First Fix
Free Scheme</a>, Irish Water will contact you by post if your water meter
indicates that there may be a leak on your external supply pipe. If you are
eligible for the scheme (see below) Irish Water will offer you a free
investigation on this pipe and free repair of identified leaks. Generally, this
will involve fully replacing the pipe from the meter to a point as close to the
dwelling as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Who is eligible?</strong></p>

<p>The First Fix Free Scheme is available to domestic customers who have
registered with Irish Water; who have water meters; whose property has a
working and accessible inside stop valve; and whose water meter indicates a
leak on the external supply pipe.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l6a2ae">Who is liable to pay?</h2>

<p>The occupier of the property that gets water and/or wastewater services from
Irish Water is liable to pay domestic water charges. If you own a property, you
are presumed to be the occupier, unless it is proven otherwise.</p>

<h3>Rental properties</h3>

<p>The tenant of a property is the occupier and is responsible for paying the
water charges. Landlords can provide the names of their tenants in order to
prove that they are not the occupier, and <a href="https://www.water.ie/news/irish-water-launches-camp/">Irish Water will
then contact the tenants</a>. </p>

<p>Since 1 October 2015, property owners have to provide information to Irish
Water on the occupiers of the property within 20 days of the start of a tenancy
and there is to be a deemed obligation, in all new tenancy agreements except
for short-term lets, for the occupier or tenant to pay water charges.</p>

<p>If there are no tenants in the property, the minimum 'not permanently
occupied' charge applies – see ‘Rates’ below.</p>

<h3>Types of water/wastewater system</h3>

<p>If your water comes from a private well or a group water scheme and you have
a private wastewater treatment system (such as a septic tank) you are not
regarded as a customer of Irish Water and do not have to pay domestic water
charges. </p>

<p>This table shows which types of system are and are not subject to domestic
water charges:</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l20ac7">Charging system</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.water.ie/billing-and-metering/metering-explained/">Irish
Water continues to install water meters</a>. Your meter measures the amount of
water supplied to your home. The amount of wastewater discharged is assumed to
be the same as the amount of water drawn from the supply.</p>

<h3>Capped charges</h3>

<p>While the meter measures your water usage, your quarterly bill is capped at
a maximum rate for your household type, so you do not have to pay any more than
this maximum capped rate – see ‘Rates’ below. The capped charges will
apply until 31 December 2018. The Water Services Act 2014 provides for the
capping of charges beyond 2018, subject to a Ministerial Order being approved
by both Houses of the Oireachtas. </p>

<p>If you need to use extra water because of a medical condition, you do not
have to provide any extra information, as your bills are capped in the same way
as for everyone else. (However, you can apply to be registered for priority
services if you are critically dependent on water.)</p>

<h3>Rebates, allowances and discounts</h3>

<p>If your metered usage is lower than the capped charge level, your bill will
be less than the capped rate. If you do not yet have a water meter, your bill
will be fixed at the relevant capped rate, but after your meter has been
installed, you will get a rebate if your metered usage over a 1-year period
turns out to be lower than the capped level.</p>

<p>Metered bills provide for a free allowance to cover each child’s normal
water/wastewater needs (21,000 litres per child), regardless of entitlement to
Child Benefit.</p>

<p>If your water quality is not what it should be and there is a Boil Notice or
Drinking Water Restriction Notice in effect, you will get a 100% discount on
the water supply element of your charge until the notice is lifted.</p>

<h3>Registering with Irish Water</h3>

<p>Irish Water has sent application packs to every house in the State, asking
people to indicate which (if any) public water services they have, and to
confirm their household details – see ‘How to apply’ below. All
households have been asked to register. </p>

<p>The requirement to provide Personal Public Service Numbers (PPS Numbers)
when registering with Irish Water is no longer in effect. Irish Water has
developed a protocol, in consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner,
for deleting all the PPS Numbers that it had collected.</p>

<h3>If you haven’t registered</h3>

<p>If you do not register with Irish Water, you will be charged a default rate
of €260 a year up to 31 December 2018. </p>
<ul><li>If you registered during 2015, your occupancy details and any allowances
    will be backdated to 1 January 2015</li>
  <li>If you register during 2016, your occupancy details and any allowances
    will be backdated for the billing period in which you register, and the
    billing period before it</li>
</ul><p>Irish Water’s First Fix Free Scheme (described above) is only available to
registered customers.</p>

<h2 class="further_info" id="lf9e27">Billing and payment</h2>

<p>Domestic water bills are issued 4 times a year. The first bills issued from
April 2015, in respect of the quarter January-March 2015. </p>

<p>You can opt for paper or paperless billing. Irish Water has developed a
confidential special services register for customers who need billing or other
customer services adapted to suit their needs and you can choose to get your
bill in a range of accessible formats.</p>

<p>There are several payment options, including direct debit; electronic funds
transfer; full or partial payment (of at least €5) at post offices and retail
outlets. If you are getting a social welfare payment through the post office,
you can use the <a href="../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/household_budget_scheme.html">Household
Budget Scheme</a> to pay regular weekly amounts (of at least €2.50) off your
water bills. </p>

<p>If you are in financial difficulty, the <a href="../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/mabs_service.html">Money
Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS)</a> can help with budgeting in general. The
<a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/exceptional_needs_payments.html">Exceptional
Needs Payment</a> is available to people who have severe financial
difficulties.</p>

<p>Irish Water has outlined its approach to customers who have payment
difficulties. This includes developing payment plans and engaging with relevant
agencies, such as MABS, with the customer’s permission.</p>

<p>Read more in Irish Water’s <a href="http://www.water.ie/docs/Domestic-Billling-Code-of-Practice.pdf">Domestic
Billing Code of Practice (pdf)</a> and in the <a href="http://www.water.ie/billing-and-charges/billing/billing-explained/">Billing
explained</a> section of its website.</p>

<h3>If you don’t pay your bills</h3>

<p>Irish Water will not cut you off or reduce your water supply, but late
payment charges will accrue on your account – see ‘Rates’ below. Irish
Water can also take people to court if they don’t pay their bills.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/Civil-Debt-(Procedures)-Act-2015">Civil
Debt (Procedures) Act 2015</a> provides for <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR15000386">2 new ways of enforcing
civil debt</a> (including unpaid water charges) – attachment of earnings and
deduction from social welfare payments, as appropriate. These provisions of the
Act (not yet in effect) will apply to debts of over €500 and under
€4,000.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/29/section/48/enacted/en/html">Section
48 of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015</a> obliges the owner
of a dwelling to pay any unpaid water charges owing to Irish Water when the
property is being sold. It also provides that social housing tenants cannot buy
their homes under a <a href="../../housing/local_authority_and_social_housing/buying_your_local_authority_house.html">tenant
purchase scheme</a> unless their water charges have been paid.</p>

<h3>Complaints and disputes</h3>

<p>Irish Water’s <a href="http://www.water.ie/docs/Domestic-Complaint-Handling-Code-of-Practice.pdf">Domestic
Complaint Handling Code of Practice (pdf)</a> outlines how you can make a
complaint if you are not satisfied with any of its services or any contacts you
have had with it. Its <a href="http://www.water.ie/docs/Customer-Charter.pdf">Domestic Customer Charter
(pdf)</a> provides a series of guarantees on how it will deal with customer
issues.</p>

<p>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is the economic regulator of
Irish Water.</p>

<p>The CER does not handle complaints about water quality. If you have a
complaint about <a href="water_quality.html">water quality</a> that has not
been resolved by Irish Water, you should refer it to the <a href="http://www.epa.ie/">Environmental Protection Agency</a>, which is the
environmental regulator of Irish Water.</p>

<p><strong>Dispute resolution service</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0044/print.html#sec8">Section
8 of the Water Services Act 2014</a> provides for the CER to operate a
statutory <a href="http://www.cer.ie/customer-care/water/complaints">dispute
resolution service</a> to handle unresolved complaints from customers of Irish
Water. If you wish to use this service, you must:</p>
<ul><li>Have been a registered Irish Water customer at the time to which the
    complaint relates</li>
  <li>Have already made your complaint to Irish Water in writing</li>
  <li>Have completed Irish Water's complaints process and received a final
    decision in writing</li>
</ul><p>The CER will issue its decision on the complaint to Irish Water. It can
require Irish Water to pay a refund or compensation. It may also require Irish
Water to comply with its decision in respect of other customers affected by the
same issue.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic further_info">
<h2 class="further_info" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>If you have a meter, your bill is either based on your metered usage or
fixed at a capped level, whichever is lower. See below for details of metered
and capped rates.</p>

<p>There is no charge for children aged under 18 – their usage is covered by
a free allowance.</p>

<p>The minimum charge for unoccupied dwellings is €62.50 per service per year
– a total of €125 for a house using both public water supply and public
wastewater services. This charge is capped at €260 per year for a house using
both services, and €130 for houses using a single service.</p>

<p>The default rate for people who do not register is €260 per year – see
‘If you haven’t registered’ above for details.</p>

<p>If you do not pay within 12 months of the demand for payment or have not
entered into a payment plan with Irish Water, or have not complied with a
payment plan, there will be a late payment fee of €30 a year for a
single-adult household and €60 a year for a household with two or more
adults. If you only have one water service, the late payment fee is halved. </p>

<p>An additional €30 or €60 will be added on every anniversary of the
original add-on date while the bill remains unpaid or a payment plan has not
been entered into with Irish Water. This provision applies to all annual
amounts that remain unpaid or where a payment plan has not been entered
into.</p>

<p>Any customers who have unpaid water charges can be pursued through the
Courts by Irish Water for the sums due and a judgment may be obtained against
the customer for the amount due.</p>

<h3>Metered rates</h3>

<p>If your household uses the public water supply <strong>and</strong> the
public wastewater service, the metered rate is €3.70 per 1,000 litres – 1
cubic metre. If your household only uses 1 public water service - supply or
wastewater services, the rate is €1.85 per 1,000 litres.</p>

<p>If you use less water than the capped levels below, you will be billed for
the lower metered usage. If your meter is installed after 1 January 2015, and
your usage during your first full year with a meter is lower than the relevant
capped rate, Irish Water will provide a rebate of the difference between the
charges paid during the unmetered period and the charges that would have been
paid under metered usage. </p>

<h3>Capped rates</h3>

<p>The capped rates are based on usage of just over 43,000 litres per year for
a single-adult household and just over 70,000 litres per year for a multi-adult
household.</p>

<p><strong>For both services:</strong> The maximum rate of domestic water
charges for a single-adult household is <strong>€160</strong> per year or
<strong>€40</strong> per quarter for a household that uses both water supply
and wastewater services. The maximum rate for a multi-adult household is
<strong>€260</strong> per year or <strong>€65</strong> per quarter.</p>

<p>The table below shows the capped charges for a sample of household types
using both water services, including the maximum amount of the quarterly bills
for each of these sample households, starting from April 2015.</p>

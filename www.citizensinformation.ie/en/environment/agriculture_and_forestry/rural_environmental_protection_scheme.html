<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Various schemes have been set up over the years to provide income support
for farmers who engage in specified environmental activities. The current <a href="http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/farmerschemespayments/glas/">Green,
Low-Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS)</a>, builds on the earlier <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/ruralenvironment/agri-environmentschemes/archivedschemes/">REPS</a>
and <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/farmerschemespayments/agri-environmentoptionsschemeaeos/">AEOS</a>
schemes.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l2ad3b">GLAS</h2>

<p>The Green, Low-Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme is part of the Rural
Development Programme 2014-2020. It provides funding to farmers in return for
delivering environmental management on their land. Farmers must commit to the
scheme for a minimum period of 5 years.</p>

<h3>Aims of the scheme</h3>

<p>GLAS has a number of interlinked aims, which include:</p>
<ul><li>Protecting agricultural land, its habitats and biodiversity</li>
  <li>Promoting environmentally sustainable methods of farming</li>
  <li>Addressing issues of climate change mitigation, water quality and the
    preservation of habitats and species</li>
  <li>Maintaining features such as traditional drystone walls and hedgerows</li>
</ul><h3>Core requirements</h3>

<p>All farmers in GLAS must comply with a list of mandatory core requirements,
which aim to ensure that farmers have an enhanced level of environmental
knowledge. Farmers must keep records of relevant actions delivered and must
also have a plan for nutrient resource efficiency on their holding. They must
also undergo training in environmental practices and standards.</p>

<h3>Structure of the scheme</h3>

<p>Access to GLAS is divided into several tiers and sub-tiers.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 1 (a)</strong> is the highest priority access to the scheme.
You can gain access to it if your holding contains <em>Priority Environmental
Assets</em> such as private Natura sites, particular farmland birds (for
example, corncrakes or hen harriers), commonages, high status water areas or
rare breeds. If your holding contains any of these, you must choose them and
plan the relevant actions.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 1 (b)</strong> is for farmers who engage in <em>Priority
Environmental Actions</em>, which include minimum tillage; catch crops
establishment from a sown crop, low-emission slurry spreading and wild bird
cover. There are detailed requirements as regards stocking rates (for livestock
farms) and area (for arable farms). Registered organic farmers may qualify for
priority access to the scheme under Tier 1(b) by selecting actions appropriate
to the farm. It is not guaranteed that all eligible applicants in Tier 1(b)
will get into the Scheme and a scoring matrix will apply if necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 2</strong> is the second level of access to GLAS. It is not
guaranteed that all eligible applicants in Tier 2 will get into the Scheme and
a scoring matrix will apply if necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 2 (a)</strong> is for farmers who do not have Priority
Environmental Assets but whose lands include a Vulnerable Water Area. You must
select the appropriate actions relevant to Vulnerable Water Areas.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 2 (b)</strong> is for farmers who do not have a Vulnerable
Water Area but who engage in one of the Priority Environmental Actions listed
under Tier 1 (b). There are different requirements as regards stocking rates
and area of holding.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 3</strong> covers a series of general actions, which aim to
enhance the environmental, water quality and biodiversity benefits delivered.
They can be chosen in addition to Tier 1 and Tier 2 actions or on their own.
However, choosing only general actions will not guarantee entry to the scheme.
These actions include bat boxes, coppicing hedgerows, low-input permanent
pasture and protection of archaeological sites.</p>

<p>A scoring matrix will be used to allow farmers to join GLAS by means of
these actions if take-up of Tier 1 and Tier 2 actions permits.</p>

<h3>GLAS+</h3>

<p>Some farmers undertaking particularly challenging actions may qualify for
GLAS+, a mechanism to provide additional compensation in return for exceptional
environmental commitment.</p>

<p>GLAS+ will typically apply where the Priority Environmental Assets on the
farm require the farmer to deliver a particularly high level of environmental
commitment.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Detailed rates of payment for the various elements of GLAS are on the <a href="http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/farmerschemespayments/glas/">website of the
Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine</a>. </p>

<p>In general, the maximum GLAS payment is €5,000 per year. However, some
farmers undertaking particularly challenging actions may qualify for GLAS+ and
for a top-up payment of up to €2,000 per year. </p>

<p>In the case of Registered Farm Partnerships, these maximum amounts may be
multiplied by the number of farm holdings brought to the Partnership, subject
to a maximum of 3 holdings.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>An <a href="http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/media/migration/farmingschemesandpayments/glastranche1/Approvedadvisorlist261016.xls">approved
GLAS advisor</a> must prepare the GLAS application. </p>

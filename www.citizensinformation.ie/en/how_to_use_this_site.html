<h2>How information is organised</h2>

<p>This website is divided into 14 information categories. Each category is
further organised into sub-categories and documents.</p>

<p>On the homepage we list all of the main information categories, along some
of the more popular documents from those categories.</p>

<p>If you click the category title on the homepage, or from the 'Categories'
dropdown in the navigation bar, you can see the subcategories within that main
category.</p>

<h3>Special documents</h3>

<p>Certain documents are indicated with a special icon. These are:</p>
<ul><li>Overview documents</li>
  <li>Life Event documents</li>
</ul><p>Some documents are checklists. You may see a link in the introduction to these checklists with the option to 'pin' the checklist. If you do this, the checklist will appear on the right-hand side of the website and stay in place until you close it. This can be useful for ensuring you have checked all of your entitlements.</p>

<h2>How documents are organised</h2>

<p>Each page has a general section which gives you the information to answer
most queries.</p>

<p>Some documents will have links to other relevant material such as case studies,
checklists or worksheets.</p>

<p>Other options associated with information pages are:</p>
<ul><li>the 'Print-ready Page' icon will display a page which is optimised for
    printing</li>
  <li>the 'Related Documents' section on the right-hand side of the website allows you to see other documents that might be of interest to you.</li>
</ul><h2>Other ways to find information</h2>

<p>You can also sort information using:</p>

<ul><li>an alphabetical list of document titles</li>
  <li>a list of 'My Situation' documents - these are documents that relate to
    people in a particular situation or who wish to find information on a
    specific topic </li>
  <li>a listing by document type, for example, reference documents </li>
</ul><h2>Languages</h2>

<p>By using the language tool, you can switch the default language for the site
or view content in another language. All content is available in English and
most in Irish, while certain key documents are available in French, Romanian,
and Polish. This tool appears on all pages, and will list the languages in
which the information is available.</p>

<h2>RSS</h2>

<p>If you use an RSS reader, you can subscribe to our RSS feeds whenever you
see the RSS icon.</p>

<h2>Search</h2>

<p>You can search using the search bar wherever you are on the website.</p>

<h2>Finding a Citizens Information Centre</h2>

<p>The 'Find a Centre' section of the website lists all the main Citizens
Information Centres around the country and also the outreach locations
associated with those centres.</p>

<h2>Finding Addresses </h2>

<h2>Keeping up to date </h2>

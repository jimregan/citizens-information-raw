<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Housing Aid for Older People Scheme is used to improve the condition of
an older person's home. In general, it is aimed at people 66 years of age and
older, who are living in poor housing conditions. However, in cases of genuine
hardship the local authority may assist people under age 66.</p>

<p>If you have a disability and your home needs to be adapted to make it more
accessible, the <a href="housing_adaptation_grant_for_people_with_disability.html">Housing
Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability</a> or the <a href="mobility_aids_grant_scheme.html">Mobility Aids Grant Scheme</a> may be
more suitable for you.</p>

<p>These 3 schemes are administered by local authorities, under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/si/0670.html">Housing (Adaptation
Grants for Older People and People with a Disability) Regulations 2007</a>,
which were amended by <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/si/104/made/en/print">new
Regulations</a> in 2014.</p>

refunds are available on aids and appliances</a> used by people with

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Local authorities have been instructed that only essential repairs should be
undertaken to make the property habitable for the applicant. </p>

<p>Local authorities vary as regards what type of work they will grant aid
under the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme. You should <strong>check with
your own local authority</strong> to see which types of work its scheme will
cover. </p>

<p>The type of work that is grant aided can include some or all of the
following:</p>
<ul><li>Structural repairs or improvements </li>
  <li>Dry-lining</li>
  <li>Repair or replacement of windows and doors </li>
  <li>The provision of water, sanitary services and heating </li>
  <li>Cleaning and painting </li>
  <li>Radon remediation </li>
  <li>Re-wiring</li>
  <li>Any other repair or improvement work considered necessary. </li>
</ul><p>Many older people may be eligible for the Housing Aid for Older People
Scheme. However, priority will be given to people on the basis of financial
need.</p>

<p>The grant can be paid to people in:</p>
<ul><li>Owner-occupied housing </li>
  <li>Houses being purchased from a local authority under the <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/buying_your_local_authority_house.html">Tenant
    Purchase Scheme</a>. </li>
</ul><h3>Priority applicants</h3>

<p>Your application will be prioritised based on medical need. Highest priority
will be given to people for whom alterations or adaptations would facilitate
their discharge from hospital or the continuance of care in their own home.</p>

<h3>Occupational therapy report</h3>

<p>When the local authority receives your application, it may request an
occupational therapist's (OT) assessment. The local authority can arrange for
this, or you can employ an OT yourself and recoup up to €200 of the cost from
the local authority as part of the grant, subject to the maximum grant limit
that applies in your case. </p>

<h3>Means test</h3>

<p>Your total household income is assessed to find out if you qualify for the
grant and at what level of assistance.</p>

<p>Household income is:</p>
<ul><li>The property owner's (or tenant's) and their spouse's or partner's annual
    gross income in the previous tax year </li>
  <li>Income of any other adults living in the household - aged over 23 years
    (or over 18 and not in full-time education) </li>
</ul><p>The following is <strong>not </strong>taken into account when calculating
your household income:</p>
<ul><li>€5,000 for each member of the household aged up to 18 years </li>
  <li>€5,000 for each member of the household aged between 18 and 23 years
    and in full-time education or on a <a href="../../education/vocational_education_and_training/apprenticeships.html">SOLAS
    apprenticeship</a> </li>
  <li>€5,000 where the person to whom the grant application relates is being
    cared for by a relative on a full-time basis </li>

    Allowance</a> (if the carer's payment is made in respect of the person to
    whom the grant application relates) </li>
</ul><h3>Information required: applicant</h3>

<p>When applying for the grant, you must provide:</p>
<ul><li>Your tax reference number</li>
  <li>Details of your tax district and</li>
  <li>A statement that, to the best of your knowledge, your tax affairs are in
    order</li>
</ul><p>You must also provide evidence of ownership of the property and evidence
that the <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/housing_taxes_and_reliefs/local_property_tax.html">Local
Property Tax</a> on it has been paid.</p>

<p>You must include a written itemised quotation from a contractor, indicating
the cost of the work required. If the local authority considers that this
quotation is unreasonable, it will ask you to get another one. It is
recommended that the proposed works should include the installation of smoke
and carbon monoxide alarms, if they are not already present and operating in
your home.</p>

<h3>Tax information required: contractor</h3>

<p>For all grant payments, contractors must provide confirmation of <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/tax-clearance.html">tax clearance</a>.</p>

<h3>Starting the work</h3>

<p>The grant will <strong>not</strong> be paid if you start work before you get
grant approval. However, it is expected that the work will start within 6
months of your grant approval. If this does not happen, the local authority may
allow a time extension.</p>

<h3>Getting the work done safely</h3>

<p>Under the Regulations governing safety, health and welfare at work,
homeowners are obliged to ensure that construction work on their home is
carried out by competent people. Read more, including a <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Publications_and_Forms/Publications/Construction/homeowners_guidance.pdf">guide
for homeowners (pdf)</a> and some <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Your_Industry/Construction/Construction_FAQ's/Homeowners_FAQs.html">Frequently
Asked Questions</a>, on the website of the <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/">Health and Safety Authority</a>.</p>

<h3>Payment of a second grant</h3>

<p>It is possible to get a grant under the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme
a second time if your needs have substantially changed over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The maximum grant available under the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme is
€8,000, which may cover 95% of the approved cost of works. </p>

<p>This maximum grant of 95% is available to people with annual household
incomes of less than €30,000, tapering to 30% for those with annual household
incomes of €50,001 to €60,000. The following table shows the current
rates.</p>

<p>Note: The maximum amounts may not be fully awarded. Grant amounts are
subject to the funding of each local authority so the local authority can
decide whether they pay the full grant or a percentage in each case.</p>

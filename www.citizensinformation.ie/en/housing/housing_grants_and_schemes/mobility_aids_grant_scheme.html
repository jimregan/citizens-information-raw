<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Mobility Aids Grant Scheme provides grants for works designed to address
mobility problems in the home, such as the purchase and installation of
grab-rails, a level access shower, access ramps or a stair-lift. The scheme is
primarily for older people, but people with a disability can also apply for
it.</p>

<p>If you need more extensive works done, or if you do not qualify under the
means test, you can apply for the <a href="housing_adaptation_grant_for_people_with_disability.html">Housing
Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability</a> instead. Depending on your
situation, the <a href="housing_aid_for_older_persons_scheme.html">Housing
Aid for Older Persons Scheme</a> may be more suitable for you.</p>

<p>These 3 schemes are administered by local authorities, under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/si/0670.html">Housing (Adaptation
Grants for Older People and People With A Disability), Regulations 2007</a>,
which were amended by <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/si/104/made/en/print">new
Regulations</a> in 2014.</p>

<p>You can apply for a <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/vat_refunds_on_aids_and_appliances_used_by_people_with_disabilities.html">refund
of VAT</a> on the aids and appliances that you need. This refund scheme also
applies to the cost of the installation work.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The Mobility Aids Grant Scheme is available to people with a household
income of <strong>less than</strong> €30,000 per year. </p>

<p>The grant can be paid to people in:</p>
<ul><li>Owner-occupied housing </li>
  <li>Houses being purchased from a local authority under the <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/buying_your_local_authority_house.html">Tenant
    Purchase Scheme</a> </li>
  <li>Private rented accommodation (the duration of your tenancy can affect
    grant approval) </li>
  <li>Accommodation provided under the voluntary housing Capital Assistance and
    Rental Subsidy schemes </li>
  <li>Accommodation occupied by people living in communal residences. </li>
</ul><p>You must satisfy the local authority that you will occupy the property as
your normal place of residence when the works have been done. If you are a
tenant, you must also get written approval from your landlord.</p>

<p>Your application for the grant will be prioritised according to your medical
need. Highest priority will be given to people who are terminally ill, or where
alterations or adaptations would facilitate their discharge from hospital or
the continuance of care in their own home. </p>

<p>When the local authority receives your application, it may request an
occupational therapist's (OT) assessment. The local authority can arrange for
this, or you can employ an OT yourself and recoup up to €200 of the cost from
the local authority as part of the grant, subject to the maximum grant limit of
€6,000.</p>

<h3>Means test<br></h3>

<p>Your total household income is assessed to find out if you qualify for the
grant and at what level of assistance.</p>

<p>Household income is:</p>
<ul><li>The property owner's (or tenant’s) annual gross income, together with
    their spouse’s or partner’s annual gross income in the previous tax
  year</li>
  <li>The income of any other adults living in the household who are aged over
    23 years if in full-time education, or aged over 18 if not in full-time
    education</li>
</ul><p>The following is <strong>not</strong> taken into account when calculating
your household income:</p>
<ul><li>€5,000 for each member of the household aged up to 18 years </li>
  <li>€5,000 for each member of the household aged between 18 and 23 years
    and in full-time education or on a <a href="../../education/vocational_education_and_training/apprenticeships.html">SOLAS
    apprenticeship</a> </li>
  <li>€5,000 where the person to whom the grant application relates is being
    cared by a relative on a full-time basis </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child
    Benefit</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
    Income Supplement</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/domiciliary_care_allowance.html">Domiciliary
    Care Allowance</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/carers/respite_care_grant.html">Respite
    Care Grant</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/carers/carers_benefit.html">Carer's
    Benefit</a> and <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/carers/carers_allowance.html">Carer's
    Allowance</a> (if the carer's payment is made in respect of the person to
    whom the grant application relates) </li>
</ul><h3>Information required</h3>

<p>When applying for the Mobility Aids Grant Scheme, you must provide:</p>
<ul><li>Your tax reference number</li>
  <li>Details of your tax district</li>
  <li>A statement that, to the best of your knowledge, your tax affairs are in
    order</li>
</ul><p>You must provide evidence that the <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/housing_taxes_and_reliefs/local_property_tax.html">Local
Property Tax</a> on the house has been paid. There is a relief from Local
Property Tax (LPT) on properties that have been adapted for occupation by a
disabled person. Read more in our document, <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/housing_taxes_and_reliefs/local_property_tax_exemptions.html">Exemptions
from Local Property Tax</a> and in <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/lpt/guidelines-reliefs-disabled-incapacitated.pdf">Revenue’s
guidelines (pdf)</a>. </p>

<p>You must include a written itemised quotation from a contractor, indicating
the cost of the work required. If the local authority considers that this
quotation is unreasonable, it will ask you to get another one. It is
recommended that the proposed works should include the installation of smoke
and carbon monoxide alarms, if they are not already present and operating in
your home.</p>

<p>If you intend to pay more than €650 to a contractor, your contractor may
be asked to submit their <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/tax-clearance.html">Tax Clearance
Certificate</a> to the local authority.</p>

<h3>Starting the work to adapt your home </h3>

<p>It is expected that the work will start within 6 months of your grant
approval. If this does not happen, the local authority may allow a time
extension.</p>

<h3>Applying for a further grant</h3>

<p>In general, the work done on your home is expected to be appropriate to your
future needs as well as your current needs. However, if your needs change
substantially over time, you may find that further works are required. You can
apply again for a Mobility Aids Grant and your application will be assessed in
the normal way. There is no minimum time limit between the payment of a first
and second grant.</p>

<p>The maximum grant available is €6,000, which may cover 100% of the cost of
the work. </p>

<p>Note: The maximum amount may not be fully awarded. Grant amounts are subject
to the funding of each local authority, so the local authority can decide
whether they pay the full grant or a percentage in each case. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>Download an application form from your local authority’s website or ask
for one to be posted to you. The form contains detailed information on the
scheme’s conditions and a checklist of documents that you must include.</p>

<p>If you are unhappy with the local authority’s decision in your case, you
can appeal the decision. The appeal must be in writing and must be made within
3 weeks of the decision. You must state the reasons and grounds for your
appeal. Further information is available from your <a shape="rect" href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local

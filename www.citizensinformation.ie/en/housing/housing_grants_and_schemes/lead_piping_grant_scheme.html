<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>A new grant scheme has been set up to help low-income households with the
cost of replacing lead piping in their homes. The scheme is being introduced
under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/si/56/made/en/pdf">Domestic Lead
Remediation (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2016 (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/Water/WaterQuality/LeadinDrinkingWater/">More
details of the scheme</a> are on environ.ie, along with a combined <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Environment/Water/FileDownLoad,44180,en.pdf">information
note and application form (pdf)</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You must own the dwelling and live in it as your principal private
residence. The lead pipes and fittings being replaced must form part of a
system that carries water for preparing food or drinks or for direct human
consumption.</p>

<p>You must get the remedial work done <strong>before</strong> applying for the
grant. Any contractor that you use must give you a current <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/tax-clearance.html">tax clearance
certificate</a>. They must provide itemised receipts, detailing the work
carried out and the associated costs. They must also certify in writing that
any materials used, including pipes and fittings, are of appropriate quality
and that a proper standard of workmanship has been applied. You will need to
enclose these certificates and receipts with your application for the grant.</p>

<p>You must also provide evidence of a risk of lead contamination in your home.
Acceptable evidence is either:</p>
<ul><li>A notification from your water supplier advising that your water system
    is likely to contain lead pipes and fittings</li>
</ul><p><strong>or</strong></p>
<ul><li>A laboratory certificate issued within the previous 6 months, showing a
    parametric value for lead in your water supply that is over the statutory
    limit. The issuing laboratory must be accredited by the <a href="http://www.inab.ie/">Irish National Accreditation Board (INAB)</a>
    for testing for lead in drinking water.</li>
</ul><h3>Evidence of income</h3>

<p>The grant is means-tested – see ‘Rates’ below. You will have to
provide evidence of your household income when applying. This is calculated as
your gross taxable income in the previous tax year, together with that of your
spouse or partner. The required evidence is:</p>
<ul><li>For employees paying tax under PAYE, a <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/personal/p21-balancing-statement.html">balancing
    statement (P21)</a> or equivalent document from Revenue</li>
  <li>For self-employed people, a notice of income tax assessment or equivalent
    document from Revenue</li>
  <li>For people on social welfare payments, a <a href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/secure/OnlineStatementRequest.aspx">statement
    of income</a> from the Department of Social Protection</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Lead can be present in drinking water, as lead piping, lead solder and
lead-lined water tanks were commonly used in plumbing up to and including the
1970s, so some people may still be getting water through these older plumbing
systems. Lead is a danger to health, especially for young children, pregnant
women and babies fed on formula, so water for drinking and cooking should
contain as little lead as possible. The legal level of lead in drinking water
is <strong>10 micrograms per litre</strong>.</p>

<p>The HSE has published a <a href="https://www.epa.ie/pubs/advice/drinkingwater/7523%20%20-%20epa%20Drinking%20Water%20Report%20WEB.pdf">joint
position paper on lead in drinking water (pdf)</a> with the EPA, along with a
<a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/health/hl/water/drinkingwater/lead/">set of
FAQs</a>. A national <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/Water/WaterSectorReform/News/MainBody,41734,en.htm">strategy
to reduce lead exposure</a> has been published and Irish Water is preparing a
<a href="http://www.water.ie/help-centre/questions-and-answers/lead-pipes-information-for-customers/?category=water-quality-queries">national
mitigation plan</a>. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/hri/index.html">Home
Renovation Incentive (HRI)</a> scheme enables homeowners or landlords to claim
tax relief on repairs, renovations or improvement work that is carried out on
their main home or rental property by tax-compliant contractors and that is
subject to 13.5% VAT. With effect from 1 January 2017, HRI has been extended to
local authority tenants who have written consent from the local authority to
carry out the works.</p>

<p>The HRI is paid in the form of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying
expenditure, which can be set against your income tax over 2 years. This
effectively reduces the rate of VAT to zero on qualifying work, up to a value
of €30,000.</p>

<p>In order to qualify for the HRI, the work must be done between 25 October
2013 and 31 December 2018 for homeowners; between 15 October 2014 and 31
December 2018 for landlords; and between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2018
for local authority tenants. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To qualify for the HRI as an owner-occupier, the work must be carried out on
your principal private residence. As noted above, landlords can qualify in
respect of work done on their rental properties, which must be <a href="../renting_a_home/registering_a_tenancy.html">registered with the
Residential Tenancies Board</a>.</p>

<p>You must be paying income tax - whether under PAYE or self-assessment - to
avail of the HRI.</p>

<p>If you are a homeowner or a landlord, you must be up to date with your
obligations under the <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/housing_taxes_and_reliefs/local_property_tax.html">Local
Property Tax</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a local authority tenant, you must get prior written consent from
the local authority to carry out the works.</p>

<p>Any contractor you use must be registered for <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/duties_and_vat/value_added_tax.html">Value
Added Tax (VAT)</a> in Ireland and be tax-compliant. Revenue has published <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/hri/hri-contractor-faqs.html">FAQs
for contractors.</a> If several contractors, such as a builder, a plumber and
an electrician, carry out qualifying work on your home or rental property, you
can combine the cost of the works to make up the minimum qualifying amount –
see 'Rates' below.</p>

<h3>Qualifying work</h3>

<p>The type of work that qualifies for the HRI is repair, renovation or
improvement work that is subject to VAT at 13.5%. This includes extensions,
garages and attic conversions; the supply and fitting of kitchens, bathrooms
and built-in wardrobes; fitting of windows; garden landscaping; plumbing,
tiling, rewiring, plastering and painting. </p>

<p>If you are having your <a href="../owning_a_home/home_owners/domestic_wastewater_treatment.html">septic
tank</a> repaired or replaced, or are installing a <a href="../../environment/environmental_protection/radon_in_buildings.html">radon
gas mitigation solution</a>, these types of work also qualify for the HRI. Work
on driveways and on rainwater harvesting systems can also qualify. There are <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/hri/hri-general-faqs.html#section12">more
examples of qualifying work on revenue.ie</a>. If you are unsure about whether
your works will qualify, contact your Revenue office – see 'Where to apply'
below.</p>

<p>Work that is subject to VAT at 23% (such as architect’s fees) is not
covered. Neither are items such as furniture, white goods or carpets.</p>

<p><strong>Homeowners:</strong> In general, the work must be carried out and
paid for between 25 October 2013 and 31 December 2018. Qualifying work between
25 October 2013 and 31 December 2013 is treated as if it was carried out and
paid for in 2014.</p>

<p><strong>Landlords:</strong> In general, the work must be carried out and
paid for between 15 October 2014 and 31 December 2018. Qualifying work between
15 October 2014 and 31 December 2014 is treated as if it was carried out and
paid for in 2015.</p>

<p><strong>Local authority tenants:</strong> The work must be carried out and
paid for between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2018. Prior written consent is
required from the local authority to carry out the works. </p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The qualifying work must cost at least €4,405 before VAT at 13.5%, which
comes to a total of €5,000 with VAT included. You will only get the tax
credit in relation to a maximum of €30,000 (before VAT) during the period
covered by the HRI.</p>

<p>The minimum credit is €595, based on the minimum qualifying expenditure of
€4,405. The maximum is €4,050, based on the maximum qualifying expenditure
of €30,000.</p>

<p>If you are claiming a grant for the works, or if they are covered by an
insurance claim, <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/hri/hri-general-faqs.html#section19">the
amount of your expenditure that qualifies for HRI will be reduced</a>. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<h3>Claiming the credit</h3>

<p>You can claim the HRI tax credit after the end of the tax year if your
qualifying expenditure has reached the minimum amount of €4,405 before VAT (a
total of €5,000) and you have paid income tax. Any unused tax credit can be
rolled over into the following year.</p>

<p>In general, the tax credit is payable over the 2 years following the year in
which the work is carried out and paid for. If you are on PAYE, your HRI tax
credit will be divided evenly across your pay dates for each of the 2 years
that it is payable. If you are a self-assessed taxpayer, it will be included in
your self-assessment over 2 years, half the tax credit each year.</p>
<ul><li>For homeowners, 2015 was the first year in which you could claim a HRI
    credit</li>
  <li>For landlords, 2016 was the first year in which you could claim a HRI
    credit</li>
</ul><p>For local authority tenants, 2018 will be the first year in which you can
claim a HRI credit – this will be for payments made in 2017. Further
information will be published shortly. In the meantime, you should contact your
Revenue office for information.</p>

<h3>Details of the work</h3>

<p>For you to be able to claim the HRI credit, your contractor(s) must enter
details of the work on the HRI <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/hri/online-admin-faqs.html">online
administration system</a>. This system is only accessible to contractors who
are registered for VAT and are tax-compliant.</p>

<p>Revenue advises applicants to log in to HRI online (see ‘Where to apply’
below) to check that their contractors have correctly entered details of the
works and payments. </p>

<h3>Checklist</h3>

<p>You should also:</p>
<ul><li>Ensure that you have paid or arranged to pay any Local Property Tax (LPT)
    that is due</li>
  <li>Check that your contractor <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/hri/hri-homeowner-faqs.html#section2">has
    a VAT number and is tax-compliant</a> </li>
  <li>Ensure that the work qualifies – see 'Qualifying work' above</li>
  <li>If you are a local authority tenant, get written authorisation from the
    local authority before getting any work done</li>
  <li>Keep all supporting documentation – <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/tax-clearance.html">tax clearance
    certificates</a>, estimates, receipts etc.</li>
  <li>Give the contractor the LPT Property ID of your property but
    <strong>not</strong> your LPT PIN or your <a href="../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">Personal

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Better Energy Homes Scheme provides grants to homeowners to improve
energy efficiency in their homes. Landlords and owners of more than one
property can also apply for a grant under the scheme. It is administered by the
Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Grants are available for the following energy-saving work:</p>
<ul><li>Roof insulation </li>
  <li>Wall insulation - for example, cavity wall, internal dry lining or
    external insulation</li>
  <li>Heating controls upgrade </li>
  <li>Installation of a high-efficiency boiler (more than 90% efficiency)
    including a heating controls upgrade </li>
  <li>A Building Energy Rating (BER) after the energy-saving work is carried
    out (you <strong>must</strong> get this BER to qualify for the grant) </li>
  <li>Solar heating </li>
</ul><p>See the <a href="http://www.seai.ie/Grants/Better_energy_homes/Better_Energy_Homes_Application_Guide.pdf">Application
Guide (pdf)</a> for summary performance requirements under each of these
measures. Your contractor(s) must carry out the works in accordance with
detailed standards set out in the <a href="http://www.seai.ie/EEOS/Full-Code-of-Practice-and-Technical-Specification.pdf">Contractor
Code of Practice and Technical Specification (pdf)</a>. </p>

<p>SEAI publishes <a shape="rect" href="http://www.seai.ie/Grants/Better_energy_homes/Better_Energy_FAQ/">detailed
FAQs about the Better Energy Homes Scheme</a>.</p>

<h3>How to qualify </h3>

<p>You must have grant approval before you buy materials or start any
grant-funded energy-saving work. If you have already started work, you will not
be eligible for a grant. The grant approval remains valid for 6 months after
the date it is issued. </p>

<p>However, a <em>before BER</em> can be done ahead of grant approval and could
prove useful if you are uncertain about your energy-saving options or what to
get done first. </p>

<p>To qualify for a grant you must:</p>
<ul><li>Be the owner of a dwelling built before 2006 </li>
  <li>Use a contractor from <a shape="rect" href="http://www.seai.ie/Grants/Better_energy_homes/homeowner/Step_2_Choose_a_registered_contractor/">SEAI’s
    registered list</a> </li>
  <li>Use newly fitted materials and products</li>
  <li>Have work done that complies with the required standards</li>
  <li>Have a BER carried out <strong>after</strong> the works are done </li>
  <li>Use a <a shape="rect" href="https://ndber.seai.ie/Pass/assessors/search.aspx">BER assessor from
    SEAI’s National Register</a> </li>
</ul><p>You may not get a grant if:</p>
<ul><li>You are replacing your existing boiler with a typical efficiency boiler
    of less than 90% efficiency </li>
  <li>You replace your boiler but do not replace the heating controls </li>
  <li>The measures do not comply with the required standards</li>
  <li>The relevant measure (the work on your home) was already incentivised
    under another grant programme</li>
</ul><h3>How to find out if your home would benefit from energy-saving work </h3>

<p>You can use the <a shape="rect" href="https://hes.seai.ie/MeasureRecommendations/MeasureRecommendations.aspx">Home
Energy Self Survey</a> to identify areas in your home which could be improved
to increase its energy efficiency.</p>

<p>You can also get a Building Energy Rating (BER) done in advance of any
works. A BER assessor will energy rate your home and provide you with an
advisory report, which will help identify areas that could be improved to
increase the energy efficiency of your home.</p>

<h3>Planning permission</h3>

<p>In general, you will not need <a href="../planning_permission/planning_perm_altering_a_house.html">planning
permission</a> for the measures that are grant-aided under this scheme, though
you may require it for external wall insulation. This will depend on matters
such as whether the insulation will affect the external appearance of the
building or whether the building is a protected structure. Contact your <a shape="rect" href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local
authority</a> to check if you need planning permission. </p>

<h3>Getting the work done safely</h3>

<p>Under the Regulations governing safety, health and welfare at work,
homeowners are obliged to ensure that construction work on their home is
carried out by competent people. Read more, including a <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Publications_and_Forms/Publications/Construction/homeowners_guidance.pdf">guide
for homeowners (pdf)</a> and some <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Your_Industry/Construction/Construction_FAQ's/Homeowners_FAQs.html">Frequently
Asked Questions</a>, on the website of the <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/">Health and Safety Authority</a>.</p>

<h3>Home Renovation Incentive</h3>

<p>As well as getting a grant under the Better Energy Homes Scheme, you may be
able to claim a tax credit on part of the cost of the work. Read more in <a href="home_renovation_incentive.html">our document on the Home Renovation
Incentive</a> and in <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/hri/hri-general-faqs.html">these
FAQs published by Revenue</a>. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Grants are paid after the work is completed and you have paid your
contractor. </p>

<p>Applications received from <a href="http://www.ahg.gov.ie/gaeltacht/islands/populated-off-shore-islands/">specific
offshore islands</a> are eligible for 50% additional grant support. </p>

<p>If the cost of the work (including <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/duties_and_vat/value_added_tax.html">VAT</a>) is less
than the maximum grant amount, you will get a grant for the actual cost of the
work.</p>

<p>If you are claiming a tax credit under the Home Renovation Incentive, the
amount of expenditure that qualifies for the credit will be reduced, as
outlined in <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/hri/hri-general-faqs.html#section19">this
FAQ</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Bonuses:</strong> A bonus of €300 is payable when you have
completed 3 qualifying measures and a further €100 is payable on completion
of a 4th measure. The full grant history of your home is taken into account
when calculating whether a bonus is due. A BER does not count as a measure when
calculating entitlement to a bonus.</p>

<p>The following table shows the maximum levels of grant and the bonuses
payable for extra measures.</p>

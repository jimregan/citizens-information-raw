<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>A new Repair and Leasing Scheme has been developed to bring vacant
properties into social housing use. The scheme is aimed at owners of vacant
properties who cannot afford the repairs needed to bring their property up to
the standard for renting. </p>

<p>If your vacant property is suitable for social housing, the cost of
necessary repairs is met up-front by the local authority or an <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/housing_associations.html">approved
housing body (AHB)</a>. You then lease the property to the local authority or
AHB, who will make it available for social housing. You will get an agreed
lease payment from the local authority or AHB and the value of the repairs will
be gradually offset against this lease payment over a specified period.</p>

<p>A pilot was launched in Waterford and Carlow in October 2016. The scheme is
gradually being extended to all local authorities. Read more in <a href="http://www.housing.gov.ie/housing/rebuilding-ireland/coveney-announces-eu32m-rollout-repair-and-leasing-scheme">this
press release</a> and in these <a href="http://www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/repair-leasing-faqs_feb-2017.pdf">FAQs

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Properties suitable for the scheme</h3>

<p>The property must have been vacant for at least 12 months before being
submitted for the Repair and Leasing Scheme. You will need to provide proof
that it has been vacant for this time.</p>

<p>There must be a social housing demand for the property and it must be
assessed as being viable to provide social housing.</p>

<h3>Repairs required</h3>

<p>If the property meets the above suitability requirements, staff of the local
authority or AHB will inspect it and provide you with a checklist of the works
that are necessary to bring it up to the standard that they require. These
requirements may vary, but as a minimum each property must:</p>
<ul><li>Be in good structural condition and be subject to inspection by the local
    authority or AHB</li>
  <li>Comply with the <a href="../renting_a_home/repairs_maintenance_and_minimum_physical_standards.html">minimum
    standards for rented houses</a></li>
  <li>Have a <a href="http://www.seai.ie/Your_Building/BER/">Building Energy
    Rating (BER) certificate</a> – minimum BER criteria may apply in some
    local authority areas</li>
</ul><p>All properties must be furnished and include certain appliances. Market rent
is typically agreed on the basis of a furnished property. There is more detail
in the <a href="http://www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/repair-leasing-faqs_feb-2017.pdf">FAQs
(pdf)</a> on the scheme.</p>

<h3>Agreeing the lease</h3>

<p>You will have to prove that you own the property and that you are
tax-compliant. You should consult with your finance/mortgage provider and get
their consent (if required) before entering into the leasing arrangement.</p>

<p>You and the local authority or AHB will sign an Agreement to Lease,
indicating your agreement to the length of the lease arrangement, the market
rent of the property and a schedule of the works required. You will also agree
how the cost of the works will be recouped through the lease payments.</p>

<p>The minimum lease term is 10 years, but it can be 15 years or 20 years,
depending on the cost of the works. The lease payments will be based on the
rates for social leasing, which are set at 80% (85% for apartments) of the
current market rental rates in the area. There will be a further adjustment to
the lease payment to offset the cost of the repair works until it has been
repaid.</p>

<h3>Arranging the repairs</h3>

<p>You can arrange a contractor yourself to carry out the repairs. If you are
not in a position to do this, the local authority or AHB can engage a
contractor instead. You will need to give formal written permission to the
local authority or AHB to arrange for works to be done on the property.</p>

<p>If you are arranging a contractor yourself, you must list out the works to
be done and get a quote from the contractor. This must be agreed with the local
authority or AHB before the work starts. The contractor must be tax-compliant
and be able to provide evidence of this on request.</p>

<p>When the work is finished, you should get an invoice from the contractor and
give it to the local authority or AHB, who will arrange a site visit to check
that the work meets the required standard.</p>

<p>If all is in order, the local authority or AHB will pay you the agreed
amount to settle the contractor’s invoice. You will need to provide a receipt
from the contractor.</p>

<h3>Repaying the cost of repairs</h3>

<p>The cost of the repairs will be offset against the agreed lease payment
until the value of the works is repaid. The local authority or AHB will agree
with you what the appropriate offset period will be in your case. There are
several ways of doing the offset - for example, through a reduction over a term
that is scaled against the duration of the lease, as in the table below.</p>

<h3>Sample arrangement</h3>

<table border="1" style="width: 100%"><caption></caption>
  <col><col><col><tbody><tr><td><strong>Cost of repairs</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Minimum duration of lease</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Offset to be cleared by</strong></td>
    </tr><tr><td>Up to €10,000</td>
      <td>10 years</td>
      <td>Year 8</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Up to €20,000 </td>
      <td>15 years </td>
      <td>Year 12</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Over €20,000 </td>
      <td>20 years </td>
      <td>Year 15</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<p>The lease agreement will contain a clawback clause to ensure that the full
value of the works will be repaid if the property becomes unavailable during
the agreed period.</p>

<h3>Landlord/tenant arrangements</h3>

<p>The properties acquired under the Repair and Leasing Scheme will be offered
to households who have been approved by the local authority for <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/applying_for_local_authority_housing.html">social
housing</a>. Tenants will sign a tenancy agreement with the landlord, which
will be the local authority or AHB. The landlord will manage the property and
provide support to its tenants. These properties will not be available to
tenants on the <a href="../renting_a_home/housing_assistance_payment.html">Housing Assistance
Payment (HAP)</a> or the <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/rental_accommodation_scheme.html">Rental
Accommodation Scheme (RAS)</a>.</p>

<h3>Ongoing maintenance, repairs and charges</h3>

<p>The local authority or AHB is responsible for internal maintenance and
repairs during the term of the lease. At the end of the term, the property will
be returned to you in good repair, except for fair wear and tear.</p>

<p>You are responsible for structural insurance, structural maintenance and
structural repair. You are also responsible for paying management company
service charges, if applicable, and any other charges for which you are liable,
such as <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/housing_taxes_and_reliefs/local_property_tax.html">Local
Property Tax</a>.</p>

<p>You will accept that furnishings and appliances may not be returned at the
end of the term. However, any furniture and appliances that are left in the
property will belong to you. There is no requirement to have them in the same
condition as at the start of the lease.</p>

<h3>Selling the property</h3>

<p>You can sell the property during the lease term. You must notify the local
authority or AHB in advance and you must transfer the lease agreement to the
new owner.</p>

<p>In some cases, the property owner may agree with the local authority or AHB
to include an ‘option to purchase’ as a condition of the lease. This gives
the local authority or AHB the option to buy the property during the term of
the lease. Such a condition can only be included if both parties agree.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The maximum repair cost allowable under the scheme is €40,000. This can
include the cost of required furniture, as agreed with the local authority or
AHB.</p>

<p>The cost of the repairs will be offset against the agreed lease payment
until the value of the works is repaid. The local authority or AHB will agree
with you what the appropriate offset period will be in your case.</p>

<p>The amount payable to you will be agreed through negotiation with the local
authority or AHB. The maximum to be agreed will be 80% (85% in the case of
apartments) of the current market rent. Reviews will usually take place every 3
or 4 years.</p>

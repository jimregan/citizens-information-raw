<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme aims to improve the energy efficiency
and warmth of homes owned by people on low incomes. It is operated by the
Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and replaces the earlier Warmer
Homes Scheme.</p>

<p>Full details of the scheme are on the <a href="http://www.seai.ie/Grants/Warmer_Homes_Scheme/">SEAI’s website</a> and
further useful information is <a href="http://www.seai.ie/WellandWarm/">on the
Keeping Well and Warm website</a>. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l359f9">How does it work?</h2>

<p>The work funded under the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme includes:</p>
<ul><li>Attic insulation </li>
  <li>Draught-proofing </li>
  <li>Lagging jackets </li>
  <li>Low-energy light bulbs</li>
  <li>Cavity wall insulation </li>
  <li>Energy advice. </li>
</ul><p>The services are provided by a panel of non-profit community-based
organisations and a panel of private contractors. Both panels are appointed by
SEAI. A surveyor calls to your home to confirm that you are eligible and assess
the amount of work needed. The work is then done by an installer, if budget is
available. Inspections are carried out on a sample of homes completed to ensure
that standards are maintained.</p>

<p>The Environmental Protection Agency encourages anyone availing of this
scheme to <a href="http://www.epa.ie/radon">have their home tested for
radon</a>.</p>

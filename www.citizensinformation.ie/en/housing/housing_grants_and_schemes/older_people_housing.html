<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Local authorities are obliged to provide housing for older people on broadly
the same basis as for the rest of the population. In general, they take age
into account when prioritising applications for housing. Some local authorities
and voluntary organisations provide specific housing for older people. </p>

<p>There are some housing-related grants that are particularly relevant to
older people or people with disabilities. In addition, the <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/vat_refunds_on_aids_and_appliances_used_by_people_with_disabilities.html">VAT
refund scheme on aids and appliances</a> used by people with disabilities also
applies to the cost of installation and adaptation work. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l23ff3">Social housing options</h2>

<h3>Local authority housing</h3>

<p>Some local authorities provide special accommodation for older people -
usually community accommodation with special security features, such as wardens
and security cameras. Each local authority allocates housing in accordance with
its own housing allocation scheme (formerly known as schemes of letting
priorities).</p>

<p>Age limits for older people’s accommodation can vary from one local
authority’s housing allocation scheme to another. Check with your own local
authority.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Voluntary housing </h3>

<p><a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/housing_associations.html">Voluntary
housing organisations</a> provide housing in a similar way to local
authorities. They provide two types of housing for older people: group schemes
and sheltered housing. They have some discretion about whom they house, but
most of their housing is assigned in consultation with the local authority.
Tenants in sheltered housing pay rent and they may qualify for <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a>.</p>

<p>Most of these organisations are community-based and were set up to meet
specific housing needs. They are known as 'approved housing bodies' as they
must be approved by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local
Government. </p>

<h3>Housing Aid for Older Persons Scheme</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="housing_aid_for_older_persons_scheme.html">Housing
Aid for Older Persons Scheme</a> aims to improve the living conditions of older
people by carrying out minor repairs to the main areas of their homes.</p>

<p>The type of work that is grant-aided varies from one local authority to
another. In general, it can include structural repairs or improvements;
rewiring; repair or replacement of windows and doors; the provision of water,
sanitary services or heating; cleaning and painting; radon remediation; and any
other repair or improvement work considered necessary.</p>

<p>Check with your local authority to see what types of work it covers under
the scheme. </p>

<h3>Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability</h3>

<p>If you need to adapt your home to meet the needs of a member of the
household who has a disability, you can apply for a <a shape="rect" href="housing_adaptation_grant_for_people_with_disability.html">Housing
Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability</a>. </p>

<p>The grant can help you to make changes and adaptations to your home, for
example, making it wheelchair-accessible, extending it to create more space,
adding a ground-floor bathroom or toilet or a stair-lift.</p>

<p>If you are buying or building a new home, you may qualify for this grant,
but at a lower rate.</p>

<h3>Mobility Aids Grant Scheme</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="mobility_aids_grant_scheme.html">Mobility Aids
Grant Scheme</a> provides grants for works designed to address mobility
problems in the home. For example, the grant can be used for the purchase and
installation of handrails. It is mainly for older people, but people with
disabilities can also access it. </p>

<p>The amount of assistance you can get under this Scheme is less than under
the Housing Aid for Older Persons Scheme and the Housing Adaptation Grant for
People with a Disability. It is a useful scheme if you need minor adaptations
or improvements done quickly.</p>

<h3>Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme</h3>

<p>The <a href="warmer_homes_scheme.html">Better Energy Warmer Homes
Scheme</a> aims to improve the energy efficiency and warmth of homes owned by
people on low incomes. It is operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of
Ireland (SEAI) and is available nationwide. It covers attic insulation,
draught-proofing, lagging jackets, energy-efficient bulbs, cavity wall
insulation and energy advice.</p>

<h3>Security measures for older people</h3>

<p>The Seniors Alert Scheme provides funds to local community and voluntary
organisations to install personal monitored alarms and items of home security.
Grants can be made to provide security measures for people aged 65 or over who
are living alone, or only with other older people, and who are unable
themselves to install or buy such equipment.</p>

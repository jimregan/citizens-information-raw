<p>Development plans set out the overall planning policies of your local
authority for a 6-year period. It consists of a written statement and a series
of maps. Work on putting together a new development plan for your area must
begin 4 years after the date of the last plan. </p>

<p>The development plan sets out your local authority's objectives for the use
of particular areas where you live (for example, residential areas, industrial
areas, agricultural areas). It also sets out your local authority objectives
for development in the area, road improvements, renewal of obsolete areas and
for improving amenities. </p>

<p>When a new development plan is being prepared, you can become involved at
the initial stage when your local authority publishes its intention to review
the plan. You will see notices about this intention in your local or national
newspaper, or you might hear an announcement on local radio. You can also
participate at the draft plan stage and if applicable, you can also participate
at the amended draft plan stage. At all of these times, you can make
observations, submissions and suggestions (within specified timeframes) about
what your local authority is proposing. </p>

<p>When the notice is published that your local authority intends to make a new
draft plan, the plan will be on public display for at least 10 weeks, during
which time you can make submissions. All submissions that are made within the
specified period must be considered before the final plan is adopted. Before
the final plan has been adopted, various statutory agencies, voluntary and
community organisations in your area are consulted and asked to give any
specialist advice and observations.</p>

<p>All planning applications in your area are measured against the development
plan, and planning permission will normally only be given where the application
is in accordance with the plan. For example the plan will contain various areas
zoned "residential" or "industrial". This indicates that developments of the
appropriate type may get planning permission.</p>

<p>If you are proposing to apply for planning permission, especially if you
want to build a house, you should look at the development plan first. </p>

<h3>National Spatial Strategy</h3>

<p>Regional guidelines and development plans must take into account the
National Spatial Strategy. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishspatialstrategy.ie/pdfs/Completea.pdf">National Spatial
Strategy (pdf)</a> is a national planning framework for Ireland from 2002-2020.
The key to the strategy is balanced regional development through the
co-ordinated development of gateway cities and towns and hub towns. The
National Strategy also takes account of the <a shape="rect" href="http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docoffic/official/reports/som_en.htm">European
Spatial Development Perspective</a>.</p>

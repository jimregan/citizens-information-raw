<p>Anyone has the right to see a planning application made to a local
authority. On payment of a fee, you also have the right to make a written
submission or observation on the application. The submission or observation
must be made within 5 weeks of the date of receipt of the planning application
(by the local authority). </p>

<p>Applicants for planning permission must put up a site notice and advertise
in a local newspaper so you may find out about an application that way. Local
authorities must prepare weekly lists of planning applications and make them
available for inspection for at least 8 weeks in their offices and public
libraries.</p>

<p>You are entitled to see all the documents submitted with a planning
application, which will be kept at the offices of your local authority.
Planning authorities cannot rule on an application until 5 weeks have elapsed
from the date of its receipt.</p>

<p>Your comments must be in writing to your local authority. If possible, you
should quote the planning application's reference number. You must quote your
name and address and postal address (if different).</p>

<p>Your submission or observation must be acknowledged by the local authority
and you must be notified of the planning decision. </p>

<p>Your comments must be based on planning considerations, not on personal
likes, dislikes or grievances. These planning considerations include:</p>
<ul><li>National and regional guidelines and ministerial directives</li>
  <li>Policies and objectives of the development plan</li>
  <li>Policies and objectives of any local plan. A local plan shall be
    consistent with the objectives of <a shape="rect" href="planning_devel_plans.html">the development plan</a> and shall consist
    of a written statement and a plan or plans indicating the objectives for
    the proper planning and sustainable development of the area to which it
    applies. It can include detail on community facilities and amenities and on
    standards of design in developments and structures. </li>
  <li>Local considerations such as site development density, parking provision,
    traffic hazards, overlooking, effects on residential amenity</li>
  <li>Public health</li>
  <li>Environmental, amenity and shopping impacts</li>
  <li>Other material planning matters.</li>
</ul><p>Anyone who has made written submissions or observations and paid the
necessary fee must be informed of the decision by the local authority within 3
days of making the decision.</p>

<p>If you made a submission or observation that has been acknowledged by the
local authority, you have the right to <a shape="rect" href="appealing_planning_permission_decision.html">appeal its planning decision
to An Bord Pleanála</a>. You also have the right to be informed of any other
appeals that have been lodged to An Bord Pleanála and to receive a copy of the
appeal. </p>

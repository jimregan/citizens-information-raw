<p>A person applying for planning permission and any person who made written
submissions or observations to the planning authority on a planning application
can appeal a planning decision made by a local authority to <a href="an_bord_pleanala.html">An Bord Pleanála</a>. </p>

<p>For example, you can:</p>
<ul><li>Appeal against a refusal to grant you planning permission or conditions
    attached to your permission or </li>
  <li>Appeal against a decision to give someone else planning permission (this
    is called a third party appeal). In this case you must have made a written
    submission/observation to the planning authority on the relevant
    application*. </li>
</ul><p>*There are 3 exceptions to the requirement to have made prior submissions or
observations:</p>
<ol><li>If a prescribed body was not notified in accordance with law, they may
    appeal without having made a submission or observation on the planning
    application. </li>
  <li>If an environmental impact statement (EIS) was required to be submitted
    with the planning application, a body that promotes environmental
    protection and meets certain other requirements may appeal the decision
    without have made a submission or observation.</li>
  <li>A person who has an interest in adjoining lands where permission has been
    granted can apply to the Board for leave to appeal the decision without
    having made a submission or observation. </li>
</ol><p>If an appeal has already been made by either the applicant and/or a valid
third party, any other person can become an "observer" and make submissions or
observations. </p>

<p>A valid appellant may request an oral hearing on payment of an additional
fee. An Bord Pleanála will normally only grant an oral hearing if the case is
particularly complex or significant national or local issues are involved.</p>

<p>An Bord Pleanála aims to make a decision within 18 weeks. If this is not
possible, it will inform all the parties of this.</p>

<p>In general, An Bord Pleanála will either:</p>
<ul><li>Grant planning permission </li>
  <li>Grant planning permission with conditions, or </li>
  <li>Refuse planning permission. </li>
</ul><p>An Bord Pleanála's decision is final and can only be challenged by judicial
review in the High Court. This process will judge whether the Board followed
due process in reaching its decision and will not include an examination of the
planning merits.</p>

<p>Files on appeals received by the Board can be inspected by members of the
public after the appeals have been determined by the Board. These files can be
inspected, free of charge, at the Board's offices for a period of at least 5
years after the appeal decision. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You must make the appeal to An Bord Pleanála within 4 weeks of the decision
by the local authority.</p>

<p>Your appeal must include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Your own name and address. </li>
  <li>Details of the proposed development, the name of the local authority, the
    planning register number and (if you are a third party) the applicant's
    name and address. </li>
  <li>The full grounds of the appeal with supporting material and arguments. No
    further submissions or elaborations on these grounds of appeal can be
    accepted by the Board. The grounds of the appeal must relate to planning
    issues only. The Board cannot take other issues into consideration. </li>
  <li>The correct fee. </li>
  <li>If you are a third party appellant, an acknowledgement from the planning
    authority that you made a submission or observations on the application to
    it. </li>
</ul><p>If you do not submit all the documentation, the appeal will be considered
invalid and cannot be considered by An Bord Pleanála. </p>

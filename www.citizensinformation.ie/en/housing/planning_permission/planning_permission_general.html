<p>If you are going to build a house, you <span>will </span>need planning
permission. If you are going to <a shape="rect" href="planning_perm_altering_a_house.html">build an extension or make other
changes to your existing house</a>, you <span>may</span> need planning
permission. Some small extensions and conservatories do not need planning
permission but you should make sure of this before you start building. Your
local authority will be able to advise you about this and tell you how to apply
as well as giving you general advice about your application. Your local
authority will also be able to tell you whether your proposals are likely to
comply with <a shape="rect" href="planning_devel_plans.html">the development
plan</a> for your area.</p>

<p>There are 3 types of planning permission: <span>permission, outline
permission and permission consequent on outline permission</span>. The most
common type is permission, sometimes called full permission. However, if you
want to see if the planning authority agrees in principle to you building a
house on a particular site or building a large extension, you might apply for
outline permission, which will require you to produce only the plans and
particulars that are necessary to enable the planning authority to make a
decision in relation to the siting, layout or other proposals for development.
If you get outline permission, you will have to submit detailed drawings and
receive consequent permission before you start building work. Generally,
outline permissions have a 3-year duration.</p>

<p>It is an offence to carry out any work that requires planning permission,
without planning permission, and the offence can carry very heavy fines and
imprisonment. However, if a genuine mistake has been made, it is possible to
apply for planning permission to retain an unauthorised development. This
permission may be refused, in which case, the unauthorised development will
have to be demolished.</p>

<p>Generally, the local planning authority must make a decision on a planning
application within 8 weeks of receiving the application, but if the local
authority needs more information, or the decision is appealed, it may take much
longer.</p>

<p>Anyone can see a copy of your application and on payment of a fee of €20,
can make <a shape="rect" href="commenting_on_planning_application.html">a
written submission or observation</a> on it. The decision on your planning
permission will be notified to you and anyone who commented in writing on it.
</p>

<p>If the local authority decides to give you planning permission, you will get
a <span>notice of intention</span> to grant planning permission. If no one
appeals the decision to <a shape="rect" href="http://www.pleanala.ie/">An Bord
Pleanála</a> within 4 weeks of the date of this decision, you will get
<span>grant of permission</span> from the local authority.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You must give a public notice of your proposals <span>before </span>making
an application. This must be done by placing a notice in a locally circulating
newspaper (your local authority will have a list) <span>and</span> putting up a
site notice that can be clearly read. You will find details of information that
must be contained in the notices in the planning application form.</p>

<p>The application must be received by the local authority within 2 weeks of
the notice appearing in the local newspaper and the erection of the site
notice. The site notice must remain in place for at least 5 weeks from the date
of receipt of the planning application. (Please note, nine days over Christmas,
from 24 December to 1 January, are <strong>not taken into account</strong> when
calculating the 5-week period).</p>

<p>You must not start building before you receive the <span>grant of
permission</span>. </p>

<p>Normally, planning permission is subject to conditions, some of which may
require changes to your proposals.</p>

<p>Planning permission normally lasts for 5 years. You may be required to make
a financial contribution towards the construction of any road, water supply or
sewerage that may be necessary.</p>

<p>If the local authority refuses your application, it will give you the
reasons for this. You have 4 weeks from the date of this decision to appeal to
An Bord Pleanála. </p>

<p>You have to pay a fee with your application. Different fees apply to
different types of development. The current fee for an application to build a
house is €65. The fee for a house extension or the conversion of a garage for
use as part of a house is €34. </p>

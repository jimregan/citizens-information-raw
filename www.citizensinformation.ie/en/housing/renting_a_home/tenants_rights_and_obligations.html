<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Several new provisions came into effect on 17 January 2017. They include:</p>
<ul><li>Extending the tenancy cycle for Part 4 tenancies from 4 years to 6
  years</li>
  <li>Requiring a landlord to give reason when terminating a Further Part 4
    tenancy in the first 6 months</li>
</ul><p>They also include restrictions on the sale of 10 or more rented units in a
development (the “Tyrrelstown amendments”).We are currently updating the
relevant documents on citizensinformation.ie with these and other recent
changes. <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/search-results/news/article/2017/01/19/further-changes-to-policy-and-the-law">Read
more on the Residential Tenancies Board’s website</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Your main legal rights and responsibilities as a private tenant derive from
landlord and tenant law as well as from any lease or tenancy agreement between
you and your landlord. </p>

<p>The main legislation governing these rights and obligations is contained in
the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0020/index.html">Landlord
and Tenant Acts 1967 to 1994</a>, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/enacted/en/html">Residential
Tenancies Act 2004</a> and the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/42/enacted/en/html">Residential
Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015</a>. However, if you are renting a room in your
landlord's home you are not covered by landlord and tenant legislation (though
you are covered if you rent a self-contained flat in your landlord’s home).
Read more in our document on <a shape="rect" href="sharing_accommodation_with_your_landlord.html">sharing accommodation with
your landlord</a>.</p>

<p>Leases or other tenancy agreements cannot take away from your rights under
the legislation, but you and your landlord can agree on matters that are not
dealt with in it. </p>

<h3>New legislation</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=33811&amp;&amp;CatID=59">Planning
and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016</a> contains
several amendments to the residential tenancies legislation. It was signed into
law on 23 December 2016. <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/search-results/news/article/2016/12/23/changes-to-policy-and-the-law">Some
of the changes take effect from 24 December 2016</a>, some took effect from 17
January 2017, and some others will require Commencement Orders.</p>

<p>The changes include:</p>
<ul><li>Measures to prevent the simultaneous serving of <a href="if_your_landlord_wants_you_to_leave.html">termination notices</a>
    on large numbers of residents in a single development</li>
  <li>Increased <a href="types_of_tenancy.html">security of tenure</a> for
    tenancies created from 24 December 2016</li>
  <li>Designation of Rent Pressure Zones, in which <a href="rent_increases.html">rent increases</a> will be capped - with
    effect from 24 December 2016</li>
  <li>Simplified procedures for <a href="disputes_between_landlords_and_tenants.html">dispute
  resolution</a></li>
</ul><p>We are currently updating the relevant documents on citizensinformation.ie
with these and other recent changes. <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/search-results/news/article/2017/01/19/further-changes-to-policy-and-the-law">Read

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l257dd">Rights as a tenant</h2>
<ul><li>You are entitled to quiet and exclusive enjoyment of your home. If noise
    from other tenants or neighbours is disturbing you, ask them to stop and
    also inform your landlord. If this does not work, you can <a href="../../environment/environmental_protection/noise_regulations.html">make
    a formal complaint</a>. </li>
  <li>You are entitled to certain <a shape="rect" href="repairs_maintenance_and_minimum_physical_standards.html">minimum
    standards of accommodation</a> </li>
  <li>You are entitled to a <a shape="rect" href="rent_books.html">rent
    book</a> </li>
  <li>You have the right to contact the landlord or their agent at any
    reasonable times. You are also entitled to have appropriate contact
    information (telephone numbers, email addresses, postal addresses, etc.)
  </li>
  <li>Your landlord is only allowed to enter your home with your permission. If
    the landlord needs to carry out repairs or inspect the premises, it should
    be by prior arrangement, except in an emergency</li>
  <li>You are entitled to reimbursement for any repairs that you carry out that
    are the landlord's responsibility </li>
  <li>You are entitled to have visitors to stay overnight or for short periods,
    unless specifically forbidden in your tenancy agreement. You must tell your
    landlord if you have an extra person moving in </li>
  <li>You are entitled to a certain amount of notice of the <a shape="rect" href="if_your_landlord_wants_you_to_leave.html">termination of your
    tenancy</a> </li>
  <li>You are entitled to refer any disputes to the Residential Tenancies Board
    (RTB) without being penalised for doing so </li>
  <li>You have the right to a copy of any <a shape="rect" href="registering_a_tenancy.html">register entry held by the RTB</a>
    dealing with your tenancy </li>
  <li>All homes for rent must have a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.seai.ie/Your_Building/BER/">Building Energy Rating
    (BER),</a> stating how energy-efficient the home is. This will help you to
    make an informed choice when comparing properties to rent. </li>
</ul><h3>Tenants of housing associations</h3>

<p>If you are renting from a housing association, a co-operative or similar
voluntary organisation (known as <em>approved housing bodies</em> or AHBs) <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/docs/default-source/legislative-changes/changes-commenced-7th-april-2016.docx?sfvrsn=2">your
tenancy now comes under the residential tenancies legislation</a> and you have
most of the same rights that private tenants have. However, there are some
differences:</p>
<ul><li>You may not assign or sublet the tenancy</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.prtb.ie/dispute-resolution/dispute-resolution/the-three-stages-of-a-tenancy/rent-reviews">Rent
    reviews</a> will be carried out in accordance with the tenancy agreement
    (if there is one) or else no more than once a year</li>
  <li>While most tenants of AHBs will get <a href="types_of_tenancy.html">security of tenure</a> – known as
    <em>Part 4</em> rights – after 6 months or more into the tenancy, this
    does not apply if you are living in transitional accommodation and the
    tenancy is for 18 months or less</li>
  <li>The landlord’s right to <a href="if_your_landlord_wants_you_to_leave.html">terminate a Part 4
    tenancy</a> for the reason that they require the dwelling for their own or
    family member occupation does not apply to AHB tenancies</li>
  <li>The <a href="repairs_maintenance_and_minimum_physical_standards.html">minimum
    standards</a> for food preparation, storage and laundry purposes do not
    apply to AHBs, so they do not have to provide their tenants with white
    goods, such as washing machines</li>
</ul><p></p>

<h3>Security of tenure</h3>

<p>In general, you may have security of tenure for 4 years, though your
landlord may end the tenancy during the first 6 months without giving any
reason. After 6 months, you have the right to stay for a further 3 years and 6
months, provided you keep the terms of the contract. These provisions are in
Part 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, so a tenancy that is in existence
for more than 6 months is known as a <em>Part 4 tenancy</em>. All tenancies are
deemed to end after 4 years.</p>

<p>If you continue to be the tenant at the end of the 4 years, you have a
<em>Further Part 4 tenancy</em>. You may stay in the property but you are
considered to have a new tenancy. You can read more about the different <a shape="rect" href="types_of_tenancy.html">types of tenancy here</a>. </p>

<p>If you intend to stay in the property, you should inform your landlord in
writing between 3 months and 1 month before the expiry of your fixed-term
tenancy or lease agreement.</p>

<p>This right to remain is subject to certain rights that the landlord
continues to have. The landlord may reclaim the property for a number of
reasons – read more in our document, <a href="if_your_landlord_wants_you_to_leave.html">If your landlord wants you
to leave</a>.</p>

<h3>Paying and reclaiming your deposit</h3>

<p>You will probably have to pay a security deposit when you agree to rent the
property. The landlord holds this deposit as security to cover any rent
arrears, bills owing or damage beyond normal wear and tear at the end of the
tenancy. There are no rules about the amount of the deposit, but it is usually
equal to one month’s rent.</p>

<p>Threshold provides <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/advice/seeking-private-rented-accommodation/paying-a-deposit/">useful
tips</a> on what to bear in mind before you pay a deposit, including a <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/download/pdf/avoid_getting_scammed_dont_lose_your_deposit.pdf">guide
to avoiding scams (pdf)</a>. Your landlord must provide you with an inventory
of the contents of the property. It is advisable to record the condition of
everything that is listed, taking photos if possible, and agree this in writing
with your landlord.</p>

<p>In general, when you leave a property at the end of the agreed rental period
or after giving the agreed notice, the landlord must return your security
deposit, promptly and in full. Read <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/advice/ending-a-tenancy/how-to-get-your-deposit-back/">Threshold’s
advice on getting your deposit back</a>. </p>

<p>However, if you leave before the end of the agreed period, the landlord may
keep your deposit, even if you have given notice. (You may also be liable for
the amount of rent due until the end of the lease, depending on what is stated
in the lease agreement.)</p>

<p>The landlord may keep part or all of the deposit in the following
situations:</p>
<ul><li>Rent arrears</li>
  <li>Unpaid bills</li>
  <li>Damage above normal <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/media-research/publications/wear-and-tear-in-respect-of-furniture">wear
    and tear</a></li>
  <li>If you have not given adequate notice</li>
</ul><p>The landlord may not hold your possessions against money that you owe, but
he can apply to the RTB if he feels that your deposit does not cover rent
arrears or the cost of damage to the property.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/42/enacted/en/html">Residential
Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015</a> provides for a new <a href="http://www.kildarestreet.com/wrans/?id=2014-06-17a.35">tenancy deposit
protection scheme</a>. These provisions are not yet in effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lc9e82">Obligations of a tenant</h2>

<p>You must: </p>
<ul><li>Pay your rent on time </li>
  <li>Pay any other charges that are specified in the letting agreement, for
    example, waste collection charges; utility bills; management fees to the
    management company in an apartment complex – see ‘Other charges and
    payments’ below</li>
  <li>Keep the property in good order </li>
  <li>Inform the landlord if repairs are needed and give the landlord access to
    the property to carry out repairs </li>
  <li>Give the landlord access (by appointment) for routine inspections </li>
  <li>Inform the landlord of who is living in the property </li>
  <li>Avoid causing damage or nuisance </li>
  <li>Make sure that you do not cause the landlord to be in breach of the law
  </li>
  <li>Comply with any special terms in your tenancy agreement, oral or written
  </li>
  <li>Give the landlord the information required to register with the RTB and
    sign the registration form when asked to do so</li>
  <li>Give the landlord proper notice when you are <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/advice/ending-a-tenancy/ending-your-tenancy/">ending
    the tenancy</a></li>
</ul><p>You should note that it may be more difficult to assert your rights if you
have broken conditions of your tenancy.</p>

<h3>Other charges and payments</h3>

<p>The owner (your landlord) is responsible for paying the <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/housing_taxes_and_reliefs/local_property_tax.html">Local
Property Tax</a> to the Revenue Commissioners. There may be an agreement that
you will pay this amount, but your liability will be to the landlord and not to
Revenue.</p>

<p>As the tenant of a property, you are the <em>occupier</em> and are
responsible for paying the <a href="../../environment/water_services/water_charges.html">water
charges</a>.</p>

<p>Whether or not you have to pay for services such as heating, electricity,
gas or TV connections depends on the terms of your letting agreement. In
practice, if you are renting a house, you are likely to be liable for all these
charges.</p>

<p><strong>Multi-unit developments</strong></p>

<p>In some multi-unit developments, such as apartment complexes, the heating
may be operated centrally and you may not have to pay separately for it. In
some complexes, cable TV may be supplied. In most complexes, bin collection is
organised by the <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning_a_home/home_owners/management_companies_for_apartment_blocks.html">management
company</a> and you may not have to pay charges for this.</p>

<p>There are annual charges in multi-unit developments to pay for the
maintenance, insurance and repair of common areas; for the provision of common
services to unit owners; and to contribute to a sinking fund for non-routine
refurbishment and maintenance expenses. Your landlord may pass these charges on
to you if this is agreed, but if they are not paid, the owners’ management
company may pursue the owner (the landlord) for them.</p>

<h3>Private tenancies and receivership</h3>

<p>If your landlord’s mortgage is in arrears and the mortgage lender has
appointed a receiver, you must pay the rent to the receiver, but it is the
landlord who remains legally responsible for matters such as returning your
deposits. The receiver may arrange for repairs to be carried out, but it is
unclear whether the receiver is required to do this or whether the receiver
takes on any of the responsibilities of a landlord.</p>

Tenant’s Guide to Receivership</a> and in Threshold’s <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/download/pdf/tips_for_receivership.pdf">tips for
tenants when a property is in receivership (pdf)</a>. </p>

<h3>Tax issues</h3>

<p>If you pay income tax and you were already renting on 7 December 2010, you
may be eligible for some tax relief on the rent. If your landlord lives outside
the State, you must deduct tax for the rent and account for it to the Revenue
Commissioners. Read more in <a shape="rect" href="tax_relief_for_tenants.html">our document on tax issues for
tenants</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you feel your rights as a tenant have been infringed, you have some
methods of redress. Our document on <a href="disputes_between_landlords_and_tenants.html">resolving disputes
between landlords and tenants</a> describes several options. These include
taking your case to the <a href="private_residential_tenancies_board.html">Residential Tenancies
Board</a>, which provides a dispute resolution service for both private and AHB
tenancies.</p>

<p><a href="http://threshold.ie/index.asp">Threshold</a> provides a free advice
and information service to tenants - see 'Where to apply' below – and has
published a <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/download/pdf/thresholdresolvingmay2016.pdf">leaflet
on resolving problems during your tenancy (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>If your landlord is not maintaining the property to the <a href="repairs_maintenance_and_minimum_physical_standards.html">proper
standards</a> you can contact your <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local
authority</a>, which is responsible for enforcing standards in rented
housing.</p>

<h3>Further information</h3>

<p>The RTB has published a <a href="http://prtb.ie/tenants/rights-responsibilities-obligations/good-tenant-guide">Good
Tenant Guide</a>, a brief summary of common issues. It has also published a <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/dispute-resolution/disputes/the-three-stages-of-a-tenancy/tenants-checklist-dispute-prevention">checklist
for tenants</a> on how to prevent disputes and a similar <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/dispute-resolution/disputes/the-three-stages-of-a-tenancy/landlord-checklist-dispute-prevention">checklist
for landlords</a>. The FLAC (Free Legal Advice Centres) website has a <a href="http://www.flac.ie/download/pdf/landlord_tenant.pdf">leaflet (pdf)</a> on
the basic rights and duties of landlords and tenants.</p>

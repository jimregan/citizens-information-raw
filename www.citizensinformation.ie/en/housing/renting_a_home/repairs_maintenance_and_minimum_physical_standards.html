<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Your landlord has a legal duty to make sure that your home meets certain
minimum physical standards. </p>

<p>In general, the standards apply to dwellings rented from private landlords,
<a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/applying_for_local_authority_housing.html">local
authorities</a> and approved housing bodies (usually called <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/housing_associations.html">housing
associations</a>). However, they do <strong>not</strong> apply to communal
housing being let by the HSE or an approved housing body.</p>

<p>These standards are set out in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2008/si/534/made/en/print">Housing
(Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008</a> as amended by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/si/462/made/en/print">Housing
(Standards for Rented Houses) (Amendment) Regulations 2009</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.housing.gov.ie/housing/private-rented-housing/minimum-standards/coveney-signs-new-regulations-standards-rental">It
was announced</a> in February 2017 that a further set of <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/si/17/made/en/pdf">Regulations
(pdf)</a> would take effect from 1 July 2017. See ‘Extra requirements from
July 2017’ below.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l629ff">Details of minimum standards</h2>

<h3>General</h3>

<p>For each apartment, flat or house being rented as a separate unit, the
landlord must ensure that the rental property is in a proper state of
structural repair. The Regulations require the landlord to maintain the
property in a sound state, inside and out. They specify that roofs, roofing
tiles, slates, windows, floors, ceilings, walls, stairs, doors, skirting
boards, fascias, tiles on any floor, ceiling and wall, gutters, down pipes,
fittings, furnishings, gardens and common areas must be maintained in good
condition and repair. They must not be defective due to dampness or
otherwise.</p>

<p>The landlord must ensure that electricity or gas supplies are safe and in
good repair, and that every room has adequate ventilation and both natural and
artificial lighting.</p>

<h3>Laundry, food preparation and food storage</h3>

<p>Article 8 of the 2008 Regulations (as amended) requires <strong>private
landlords</strong> to provide access to:</p>
<ul><li>A washing machine </li>
  <li>A clothes-dryer if the dwelling does not have a private garden or
  yard</li>
</ul><p>They must also provide facilities for cooking and for the hygienic storage
of food, to include the following:</p>
<ul><li>4-ring hob with oven and grill</li>
  <li>Cooker hood or extractor fan</li>
  <li>Fridge and freezer, or a fridge-freezer</li>
  <li>Microwave oven</li>
  <li>Kitchen cupboards that are suitable and adequate for storing food</li>
  <li>Sink with mains water supply, hot water and draining area</li>
</ul><p>For dwellings rented from <strong>local authorities and approved housing
bodies</strong>, the relevant requirements are in Article 7 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/si/0147.html">Housing (Standards
for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993</a>. This Article requires the landlord to
provide facilities for:</p>
<ul><li>Installation of cooking equipment with provision, where necessary, for
    the safe and effective removal of fumes</li>
  <li>Hygienic storage of food</li>
</ul><h3>Other requirements</h3>

<p>All landlords must provide:</p>
<ul><li>A sink with hot and cold water</li>
  <li>A separate room, for the exclusive use of each rented unit, with a
    toilet, a washbasin and a fixed bath or shower with hot and cold water</li>
  <li>A fixed heating appliance in each room, which is capable of providing
    effective heating and which the tenant can control</li>
  <li>A fire blanket and smoke alarms</li>
  <li>Access to vermin-proof and pest-proof refuse storage facilities</li>
</ul><p>In multi-unit buildings, the landlord must provide each unit with a
mains-wired smoke alarm; a fire blanket; and an emergency evacuation plan.
There must also be emergency lighting in common areas.</p>

<h3>Extra requirements from July 2017</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/si/17/made/en/pdf">Housing
(Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017 (pdf)</a> will take effect from
1 July 2017. They specify that:</p>
<ul><li>Windows that are located above a certain height will have to be fitted
    with safety restrictors, in order to prevent falls</li>
  <li>Landlords will have to provide a permanently fixed heater in each
    bathroom/shower room and to ensure proper ventilation and maintenance of
    these heaters</li>
  <li>Landlords will also have to provide carbon monoxide detectors and alarms,
    which must be suitably located</li>
</ul><h3>Damage to your possessions</h3>

<p>It is important to note that your landlord's responsibilities (to keep the
water pipes, for example, in good repair) do not normally cover you for any
damage to your possessions (caused by burst pipes, for example) and the
landlord's insurance policy is unlikely to cover your personal belongings. </p>

<p>Several insurance companies provide contents insurance for private tenants.

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ldcb2a">Inspections and enforcement</h2>

<p>Local authorities (in their role as housing authorities) are responsible for
enforcing these minimum standards.</p>

<p>If you are renting accommodation under the <a href="housing_assistance_payment.html">Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)</a>
scheme, the local authority will inspect your accommodation within the first 8
months of your tenancy. Local authorities also carry out <a href="http://www.environ.ie/housing/statistics/house-building-and-private-rented/private-housing-market-statistics">planned
programmes of inspection of rented properties</a>. </p>

<p>If you think that your home does not comply with the standards, you should
first bring the problem to your landlord’s attention, whether you are renting
from a private landlord, a local authority or a housing association.</p>

<p>If you think your accommodation is sub-standard or your landlord refuses to
carry out repairs as required, you can ask the local authority to make the
landlord comply with the standards. See 'Where to apply' below.</p>

<p>Failure to comply with the minimum standards can result in penalties and
prosecution. Housing authorities can issue Improvement Notices and Prohibition
Notices to landlords who breach the minimum standards regulations. An
Improvement Notice sets out the works that the landlord must carry out to
remedy a breach of the regulations. If the landlord does not do these works,
the housing authority may issue a Prohibition Notice, directing the landlord
not to re-let the property until the breach of the regulations has been
rectified.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>In many cases, disputes between landlords and tenants can be resolved
informally between both parties. However, sometimes a third party is needed to
hear both sides and recommend a resolution. This document outlines how to deal
with such disputes in residential tenancies and where to get help.</p>

<p>Most <a href="types_of_tenancy.html">private residential tenancies</a>
are covered by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0027/index.html">Residential
Tenancies Act 2004</a> and the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/42/enacted/en/html">Residential
Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015</a>. All such tenancies should be <a href="registering_a_tenancy.html">registered</a> with the <a href="private_residential_tenancies_board.html">Residential Tenancies Board
(RTB)</a>, which provides a dispute resolution service (see below). With effect
from 7 April 2016, <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/housing_associations.html">housing
associations</a> are covered by the legislation and come under the remit of the
RTB.</p>

<p>The legislation does not apply to <a href="sharing_accommodation_with_your_landlord.html">tenants who rent a room
in their landlord’s home</a> or to tenants of <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/">local authorities</a>. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l3afa0">Dealing with disputes</h2>

<p>If a dispute arises between you and your landlord, you can first try to
resolve it between you. If your landlord is a housing association, you should
use its complaints procedure. </p>

<p>Make sure that you are aware of your <a href="tenants_rights_and_obligations.html">rights and obligations</a>, that
you know what you want to say and that your facts are correct. It may be useful
to write to your landlord giving details of your complaints and providing any
evidence needed to back up your points, such as photographs or receipts for
repairs. Keep a record of all contacts between yourself and your landlord,
including copies of all correspondence and documents.</p>

<p>If you cannot resolve the dispute in this way, you may need outside help.</p>
<ul><li>For any problems with your tenancy, you can contact Threshold, the
    national housing charity, which provides information and advice to people
    in private rented housing</li>
  <li>If your dispute is about your home not meeting <a href="repairs_maintenance_and_minimum_physical_standards.html">minimum
    physical standards</a>, you can complain to the Environmental Health
    Service of your <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local
    authority</a>, which is responsible for ensuring that private rented
    accommodation <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/advice/dealing-with-problems-during-your-tenancy/standards-and-repairs/">meets
    these standards</a></li>
  <li>If your dispute is about the landlord’s failure to give you a <a href="rent_books.html">rent book</a>, receipts or statements of rent
    paid, you can complain to the housing department of your <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local
    authority</a>, which is responsible for enforcing the <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/advice/seeking-private-rented-accommodation/should-i-be-given-a-rent-book/">regulations
    on rent books</a></li>
  <li>If your dispute still cannot be resolved, you may decide to take your
    case to the RTB</li>
</ul></div>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="le9aba">The RTB's dispute resolution service</h2>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.prtb.ie/">The Residential Tenancies Board
(RTB)</a> offers a dispute resolution service to landlords (now including
housing associations) and tenants. Any agreement reached with its help, or
adjudicated by it, is legally binding on both parties. Landlords, tenants or
other parties who have been directly affected, such as neighbours, can initiate
the process. Landlords must be registered with the RTB to use the service but
tenants can use it even if their landlord has not registered the tenancy.</p>

<p>The service covers disputes about deposits, lease terms, termination of
tenancies, rent arrears, market rents, complaints by neighbours, breaches of
statutory obligations by either landlord or tenant and any other matters
related to the tenancy. It can also deal with disputes about terms of a lease
or other tenancy agreement that are not specified in the Residential Tenancies
Act 2004. You do not need legal representation when taking a case to the
RTB.</p>

<h3>Time limits</h3>

<p>Certain types of dispute have defined limited periods. The RTB may extend
these limits in exceptional circumstances.</p>
<ul><li>You must refer any dispute about <a href="rent_increases.html">rent
    increases</a> to the RTB before the rent increase is due to take effect or
    within 28 days after receiving formal notice of the new rent (whichever is
    later)</li>
  <li>You cannot refer disputes about rent more than 28 days after the tenancy
    has terminated</li>
  <li>You must refer disputes about <a href="if_your_landlord_wants_you_to_leave.html">notices of
    termination</a> within 28 days of receipt of the notice</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l96077">How the process works </h2>

<p>There are 2 stages to the RTB’s dispute resolution process. Stage 1 is
confidential mediation or adjudication. The parties (landlord and tenant) can
decide which method they prefer. If the parties do not wish to accept the
mediator’s or adjudicator’s decision, the dispute can be appealed to the
Stage 2, which is a public hearing by a 3-person Tenancy Tribunal. This appeal
must be made within 21 days.</p>

<p>A mediated agreement or the decision by an adjudicator or the Tribunal
results in a determination order from the RTB. Determination orders are
enforced through the Circuit Court. You can appeal a Tribunal decision to the
High Court, but only on a point of law.</p>

<h3>Mediation</h3>

<p>Mediation means that an impartial mediator helps the parties to come to an
agreement together. It can only go ahead if the RTB considers it to be the most
appropriate means of resolving the dispute and if both parties agree to it. You
can opt for face-to-face mediation or fast-track telephone mediation.</p>
<ul><li>In <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/telephone-mediation">telephone
    mediation</a>, the mediator contacts each side individually in a series of
    telephone calls</li>
  <li>For face-to-face mediation, the mediator arranges a private hearing,
    where each party can state their case and present any supporting
  evidence</li>
</ul><p>The mediator aims to help both sides to reach a resolution that is
acceptable to everyone. A report of the mediation is sent to each side, along
with a letter of acceptance and a letter of rejection of the proposed
agreement. There is a cooling-off period of 21 days, after which the parties
must return either the acceptance letter or the rejection letter to the RTB. If
both accept the mediation agreement, it becomes a legally binding determination
order of the RTB.</p>

<h3>Adjudication</h3>

<p>If the two parties do not agree to the mediation process, or if the RTB
decides that mediation is not the best option, the case goes to adjudication.
This means that an adjudicator makes a decision, which may or may not reflect
any agreement reached between the parties. The parties then decide whether they
are willing to accept this decision.</p>

<p>The adjudicator is appointed to investigate the case fully. Based on the
evidence and witnesses of the two parties, the adjudicator decides how the
dispute is to be resolved. In some cases, a <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/dispute-resolution/disputes/dispute-resolution-guide/paper-based-assessment-(pba)">paper-based
assessment process</a> is used.</p>

<p>As with the mediation process, the adjudicator's report is sent to both
parties, along with letters of acceptance and rejection, one of which must be
filled out and returned to the RTB within 21 days. If both accept the
adjudication decision, it becomes a legally binding determination order of the
RTB.</p>

on dispute resolution</a>.</p>

<h3>Tenancy Tribunal</h3>

<p>The Tenancy Tribunal is the second stage of the RTB's dispute resolution
service. A dispute can be referred to the Tenancy Tribunal for any of the
following reasons:</p>
<ul><li>If an agreement cannot be reached using mediation</li>
  <li>If either party wants to appeal an adjudicator's decision within 21
  days</li>
  <li>If any of the parties request a Tribunal hearing</li>
  <li>If the RTB refers the dispute directly to the Tribunal, for example,
    where there appears to be imminent risk of damage to the property or danger
    to the parties involved</li>
</ul><p>If your case is to go before the Tribunal, the RTB will notify you in
writing. This letter tells you the date, time and venue of the hearing and
gives an outline of the dispute and of the procedures that will be adopted at
the hearing.</p>

<p>The decision of the Tenancy Tribunal is issued to all parties as a
determination order of the RTB and is legally binding. You can view <a href="http://public.prtb.ie/disputes.htm">determination orders on the RTB
website</a>. Tribunal decisions can only be appealed to the <a href="../../justice/courts_system/high_court.html">High Court</a> on a point
of law and the appeal must be lodged within 21 days.</p>

FAQs</a>.</p>

<h3>Enforcement</h3>

<p>The Circuit Court is responsible for the enforcement of RTB Determination
Orders. If any of the parties do not comply with a determination order, they
can be reported to the RTB, which can apply for a Circuit Court Order directing
them to comply. You can also apply to the Circuit Court directly if you are
affected by someone's failure to comply with an order. Read more about <a href="http://prtb.continuous.ie/dispute-resolution/enforcement-of-orders">enforcement

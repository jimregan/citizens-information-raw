<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Several new provisions came into effect on 17 January 2017. They include:</p>
<ul><li>Extending the tenancy cycle for Part 4 tenancies from 4 years to 6
  years</li>
  <li>Requiring a landlord to give reason when terminating a Further Part 4
    tenancy in the first 6 months</li>
</ul><p>They also include restrictions on the sale of 10 or more rented units in a
development (the “Tyrrelstown amendments”). We are currently updating the
relevant documents on citizensinformation.ie with these and other recent
changes. <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/search-results/news/article/2017/01/19/further-changes-to-policy-and-the-law">Read
more on the Residential Tenancies Board’s website</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You are a landlord if you own land or a building and you have leased all or
part of it to another person – a tenant. Your main legal rights and
obligations as a landlord derive from landlord and tenant law as well as from
any lease or tenancy agreement (written or spoken) between you and your tenant.
</p>

<p>The main legislation governing these rights and obligations in private
rented accommodation is set down in the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0020/index.html">Landlord
and Tenant Acts 1967 to 1994</a>, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/enacted/en/html">Residential
Tenancies Act 2004</a> and the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/42/enacted/en/html">Residential
Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015</a>. However, if you are <a shape="rect" href="sharing_accommodation_with_your_landlord.html">renting a
<strong>room</strong> in your home to your tenant</a>, the tenancy does not
come under the residential tenancies legislation (though renting out a
<strong>self-contained flat</strong> in your home is covered). Read more in our
document <a href="sharing_accommodation_with_your_landlord.html">Sharing
accommodation with your landlord</a>.</p>

<p>Leases or other tenancy agreements cannot take away from your rights under
the legislation, but you and your tenant can agree on matters that are not
dealt with in it.</p>

<p>The <a href="private_residential_tenancies_board.html">Residential
Tenancies Board (RTB)</a> has published a <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/landlords/rights-responsibilities-obligations/good-landlord-guide">Good
Landlord Guide</a>.</p>

<h3>New legislation</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=33811&amp;&amp;CatID=59">Planning
and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016</a> contains
several amendments to the residential tenancies legislation. It was signed into
law on 23 December 2016. <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/search-results/news/article/2016/12/23/changes-to-policy-and-the-law">Some
of the changes take effect from 24 December 2016</a>, some took effect from 17
January 2017, and some others will require Commencement Orders. The changes
include:</p>
<ul><li>Measures to prevent the simultaneous serving of termination notices on
    large numbers of residents in a single development</li>
  <li>Increased <a href="types_of_tenancy.html">security of tenure</a> for
    tenancies created from 24 December 2016 </li>
  <li>Removing the provision that allows a landlord to end a <em>further Part 4
    tenancy</em> during the first 6 months without having to give a reason</li>
  <li>Changes to declarations required when a termination is due to sale of the
    dwelling</li>
</ul><p>We are currently updating the relevant documents on citizensinformation.ie
with these and other recent changes.<a href="http://www.rtb.ie/search-results/news/article/2017/01/19/further-changes-to-policy-and-the-law">Read

<h3>Housing associations</h3>

<p>Landlords such as housing associations, co-operatives and similar voluntary
housing organisations (known as approved housing bodies or AHBs) <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/docs/default-source/legislative-changes/changes-commenced-7th-april-2016.docx?sfvrsn=2">are
now covered by the residential tenancies legislation</a> and have most of the
same rights and obligations that private landlords have. However, there are
some differences, including the rules on <a href="rent_increases.html">rent
reviews</a>, the <a href="repairs_maintenance_and_minimum_physical_standards.html">minimum
standards</a> required and the landlord’s right to <a href="if_your_landlord_wants_you_to_leave.html">end a tenancy</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l51a46">Rights as a landlord</h2>

<p>You have the right to:</p>
<ul><li>Set the rent </li>
  <li>Receive the correct rent on the date it is due – but see 'Private
    tenancies and receivership' below </li>
  <li>Receive any charges associated with the property (this means taxes and
    duties or payments) </li>
  <li>Terminate a tenancy during the first 6 months without giving a reason
  </li>
  <li>In certain circumstances – <a href="if_your_landlord_wants_you_to_leave.html">terminate a tenancy</a>
    at a later stage </li>
  <li>Be informed about who is ordinarily living in the property (this does not
    include overnight visitors or short stays) </li>
  <li>Be informed of any repairs needed </li>
  <li>Be given reasonable access to the property to carry out repairs </li>
  <li><a href="disputes_between_landlords_and_tenants.html">Refer
    disputes</a> to the RTB – but only if you have fulfilled your obligation
    to register the tenancy - see below </li>
  <li>For private tenancies only – <a href="rent_increases.html">review the
    rent</a> every 2 years (AHB rents are reviewed every 12 months, or
    according to the tenancy agreement)</li>
  <li>For private tenancies only – decide whether the tenant may sub-let or
    assign a tenancy. However, if you refuse to allow a tenant to assign or
    sublet a tenancy, this refusal can give the tenant the right to terminate a
    fixed-term tenancy before its expiry date. </li>
</ul><p>You do <strong>not</strong> have the right to: </p>
<ul><li>Enter your tenant's home without permission </li>
  <li>Take or retain your tenant’s property – even if they haven’t paid
    the rent </li>
  <li>Charge more than the market rate for the property</li>
  <li>Penalise your tenant for bringing a dispute to the <acronym title="Private Residential Tenancies Board">RTB</acronym>.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l78a59">Obligations of a landlord</h2>

<p>As a landlord, you must:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://prtb.ie/landlords/registering-a-tenancy-what-you-need-to-provide">Register
    the tenancy</a> with the <acronym title=" Private Residential Tenancies Board">RTB</acronym> </li>
  <li>Provide your tenant with a <a shape="rect" href="rent_books.html">rent
    book</a> or statement of rent paid </li>
  <li>Make sure that the property meets <a shape="rect" href="repairs_maintenance_and_minimum_physical_standards.html">certain
    minimum standards</a> (though the standards for food preparation, storage
    and laundry purposes do not apply to AHBs) </li>
  <li>Repair and maintain the interior of the property to the standard it was
    in at the start of the tenancy </li>
  <li>Repair and maintain the structure of the property </li>
  <li>Provide a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.sei.ie/Your_Building/BER/Householders/">Building Energy
    Rating (BER)</a> for the property</li>
  <li>Reimburse tenants for any repairs they carry out which are your
    responsibility </li>
  <li>Insure the property (if it is impossible to get insurance, or if the cost
    is unreasonable, this obligation doesn’t apply) </li>
  <li>Provide the tenant with information about any agents who are authorised
    to deal on your behalf (such as management companies, agencies, personal
    representatives) </li>
  <li>Ensure that the tenant knows how to contact you or your agent </li>
  <li>Give private tenants 90 days’ notice of a <a href="rent_increases.html">rent review</a> (AHBs should give notice “as
    soon as is practicable”) </li>
  <li>Provide tenants with a valid written notice of termination if you are <a href="if_your_landlord_wants_you_to_leave.html">terminating the tenancy</a>
  </li>
</ul><p>You must also make sure that the tenants meet <a href="tenants_rights_and_obligations.html">their obligations</a>. Anyone who is
affected by your tenants’ failure to meet their obligations can make a
complaint against you to the <acronym title=" Private Residential Tenancies Board">RTB</acronym>. </p>

<h3>Deposits</h3>

<p>You may withhold all or part of a tenant’s deposit only if:</p>
<ul><li>The tenant has not given you proper notice when <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/advice/ending-a-tenancy/ending-your-tenancy/">ending
    the tenancy</a> </li>
  <li>You have been left with outstanding bills (for electricity, gas etc.) or
    unpaid rent </li>
  <li>The tenant has caused damage beyond normal <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/media-research/publications/wear-and-tear-in-respect-of-furniture">wear
    and tear</a> </li>
</ul><p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 provides for a new <a href="http://www.environ.ie/tenancy-deposit-protection-scheme">tenancy deposit
protection scheme</a>. These provisions are not yet in effect.</p>

<h3>Refusal to grant a tenancy</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_2000_0008.HTM">Equal
Status Acts 2000–2015</a> apply to lettings and accommodation. Landlords
cannot discriminate against potential tenants on grounds of gender, civil
status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race or
membership of the Traveller community.</p>

<p>In addition, since 1 January 2016, you cannot discriminate against a tenant
or potential tenant because they are getting <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a> or any other social welfare payment, or a <a href="housing_assistance_payment.html">Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)</a>.
This means that you cannot state when advertising accommodation that Rent
Supplement or HAP is not accepted and you cannot refuse to rent accommodation
to someone because they are getting a social welfare payment. Read more on the
website of the <a href="http://www.ihrec.ie/download/pdf/important_changes_to_equality_law_for_rental_market.pdf">Irish
Human Rights and Equality Commission (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Taxation issues</h3>

<p>Landlords pay tax on rental income under <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it10.html">Revenue's
self-assessment system</a>. You can <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it70.html">deduct the interest
on money borrowed to purchase, improve or repair rented property</a> when
working out your rental income for tax purposes. You must show that you have
registered all tenancies in the property with the RTB.</p>

<p>In general, for residential properties this deduction is restricted to 75%
of the interest accruing on loans. Interest is treated as accruing on a daily
basis and the date the loan was taken out is not relevant. Interest can only be
deducted during the period in which the property is let.</p>

<p>However, since January 2016, landlords who rent residential property for 3
years to tenants who are getting social housing supports can deduct all of the
interest that accrues during that 3-year period. Social housing supports
include the <a href="housing_assistance_payment.html">Housing Assistance
Payment</a>, the <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/rental_accommodation_scheme.html">Rental
Accommodation Scheme</a> and <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a>. You must submit an undertaking to the RTB, stating that you
commit to renting a residential property to tenants on social housing supports
for 3 years. The RTB will register these undertakings in its Register of
Tenancies. You can get the form for <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/docs/default-source/registration-docs/declaration-of-undertaking-form-final-3.pdf?sfvrsn=4">registering
an undertaking on the RTB's website (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>If you <a shape="rect" href="../owning_a_home/home_owners/rent_a_room_scheme.html">rent out a room or
flat in your home</a> you are exempt from income tax on the amount that your
tenant pays you for rent and other services, up to €12,000 in a tax year. </p>

<p>If you are living outside Ireland and your tenant pays rent directly to you,
the tenant must deduct tax from the gross rent and account for it to Revenue.
If the rent is being paid to a collection agent, the agent must account for the
tax. Read more in our document on <a href="tax_relief_for_tenants.html">tax
issues for tenants</a>. </p>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l48812">Private tenancies and
receivership</h2>

<p>If the mortgage on the dwelling is in arrears and the mortgage lender has
appointed a receiver, your tenants must pay the rent to the receiver, but you
remain legally responsible for matters such as returning the tenants’
deposits. The receiver may arrange for repairs to be carried out, but it is
unclear whether the receiver is required to do this or whether the receiver
takes on any of the responsibilities of a landlord.</p>

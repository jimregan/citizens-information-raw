<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a form of social housing support for
people who have a long-term housing need. HAP will eventually replace long-term
<a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a>. It has been introduced under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0021/index.html">Housing
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014</a> and a series of Statutory
Instruments.</p>

<p>The HAP scheme aims to allow all social housing supports to be accessed
through one body - the local authority - and to enable people to take up
full-time employment and keep their housing support.</p>

<p>Under the scheme, local authorities pay landlords directly*. The rent being
charged for the accommodation must be within the limits set down for the
household type in that local authority’s area – see ‘Rent limits’
below. Tenants pay a weekly HAP rent contribution to the local authority*,
based on their income and ability to pay.</p>

<p>*all local authorities use the HAP Shared Services Centre, which is based in
Limerick, to collect rents from HAP tenants and make HAP rental payments to
landlords.</p>

<p>There is detailed information about HAP on <a href="http://hap.ie/">hap.ie</a>, including booklets for <a href="http://hap.ie/uploads/files/pdf/landlord-booklet-english.pdf">landlords
(pdf)</a> and <a href="http://hap.ie/uploads/files/pdf/tenants-booklet-english.pdf">tenants
(pdf)</a>, along with a <a href="http://hap.ie/uploads/files/pdf/hap-info-leaflet-english.pdf">general
information leaflet (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Where does HAP operate?</h3>

<p>HAP has been rolled out gradually and, with effect from 1 March 2017, is now
available in all local authority areas throughout the State. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Who is eligible for HAP?</h3>

<p>You must be on the <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/social_housing_waiting_lists.html">local
authority’s housing list</a> – which means that you qualify for social
housing support. See our document on <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/applying_for_local_authority_housing.html">applying
for local authority/social housing</a> for details of assessment for social
housing support. You cannot transfer from any other form of social housing to
HAP.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.homelessdublin.ie/housing-assistance-payment-homeless-households">Homeless
HAP Pilot</a>, which is operated by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE)
on behalf of the Dublin local authorities, provides discretion to exceed the
HAP rent limits for homeless households, if this is necessary in order to
source suitable accommodation. To qualify for HAP under the pilot scheme, a
household must be accepted as homeless within the meaning of <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1988/act/28/section/2/enacted/en/html">section
2 of the Housing Act 1988</a> by one of the 4 Dublin local authorities. The <a href="http://www.homelessdublin.ie/housing-assistance-payment">Dublin Place
Finder Service</a> supports homeless households in the Dublin region to find a
tenancy using HAP. </p>

<h3>Transferring from Rent Supplement to HAP</h3>

<p>If you live in an area where HAP is available and you have been getting Rent
Supplement for a long time (generally 18 months or more) you may get a letter
from the Department of Social Protection, asking you to contact your local
authority to apply for social housing support (which includes HAP).</p>

<p>You must apply within 6 weeks of being asked to do so (but if necessary an
extra 6 weeks can be allowed). You may then be transferred to HAP or to another
form of social housing support.</p>

<p>The legislative basis for these arrangements is a series of amendments made
to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 by <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/act/21/section/54/enacted/en/html#sec54">Section
54 (3) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014</a>.</p>

<h3>Tenancy arrangements under HAP</h3>

<p>Under HAP you must find your own private rented accommodation - the local
authority will not source it for you. </p>

<p>You <a href="https://www.ihrec.ie/your-rights/i-have-an-issue-with-a-service/i-have-an-issue-about-accommodation/">cannot
be discriminated against when renting because you are getting one of certain
payments</a>, which include HAP, so landlords cannot state when advertising
accommodation that HAP is not accepted.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://hap.ie/uploads/files/pdf/landlord-booklet-english.pdf">landlord
information booklet (pdf)</a> explains what landlords need to know and outlines
the benefits of HAP to them, including direct electronic payment, low
administration and <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/housing_tax_credits_and_reliefs.en.html#lcf158">extra
tax reliefs</a>.</p>

<p>Although the local authority administers the HAP scheme, you will not be a
local authority tenant. The rental agreement will be between yourself and the
private landlord and your tenancy will be covered by the <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/en_act_2004_0027.PDF">Residential
Tenancies Act 2004 as amended (pdf)</a>. This means that you will have certain
<a href="tenants_rights_and_obligations.html">rights and obligations</a>, as
will <a href="landlords_rights_and_obligations.html">your landlord</a>. Your
tenancy must be <a href="registering_a_tenancy.html">registered with the
Residential Tenancies Board</a>. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l32e9d">When you are a HAP tenant</h2>

<p>The local authority will inspect your accommodation within 8 months of the
first HAP payment to your landlord, to ensure that it meets the <a href="repairs_maintenance_and_minimum_physical_standards.html">minimum
standards for rented housing</a>. The landlord is also required to produce
evidence of tax compliance before the total of the HAP payments adds up to
€10,000.</p>

<p>Your housing needs will have been met under HAP and you will no longer be on
the local authority’s <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/social_housing_waiting_lists.html">housing
waiting list</a>. However, if you wish to have access to other social housing
supports, such as local authority housing or housing provided by a <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/housing_associations.html">housing
association</a>, you can apply to the local authority for a transfer.</p>

<p>If you do apply for a transfer <strong>within 2 weeks of getting the letter
confirming your HAP payment</strong>, any time that you spent on the housing
list can be taken into account when your local authority considers your
application. If you apply for a transfer at a later date, the time that you
previously spent on the housing waiting list won’t count. </p>

<h3>Rent contribution</h3>

<p>You will pay a weekly HAP rent contribution to the local authority, based on
your household’s weekly income and your ability to pay, calculated in the
same way as standard <a href="http://www.housing.ie/housing-information/what-is-social-housing/renting-from-my-local-authority.aspx">local
authority differential rents</a>. This rent contribution will vary in
accordance with your income and the local authority’s rent scheme.</p>

<p>In the same way as anyone else who is paying a differential rent, you will
have to notify the local authority of any changes in your income or household
size, so that your rent contribution can be recalculated.</p>

<p>If you take up a job or increase your working hours, you will still be
eligible for HAP if you fulfil the other conditions of the scheme. This is
different from the rules that apply to Rent Supplement. </p>

<h3>Paying your landlord</h3>

<p>The local authority* will make the HAP payment to your landlord on your
behalf, subject to certain conditions:</p>
<ul><li>You must pay your weekly HAP rent contribution to the local authority*
    – if not, the local authority will stop paying your landlord</li>
  <li>If you get a social welfare payment at a post office, you must pay your
    HAP contribution through the <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/household_budget_scheme.html">Household
    Budget Scheme</a> </li>
  <li>The accommodation must meet <a href="repairs_maintenance_and_minimum_physical_standards.html">minimum
    standards for rented housing</a></li>
  <li>Your landlord must have current evidence of tax compliance </li>
  <li>You (and your household) must not engage in <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/anti_social_behaviour.html">anti-social
    behaviour</a></li>
</ul><p>*all local authorities use the HAP Shared Services Centre, which is based in
Limerick, to collect rents from HAP tenants and make HAP rental payments to
landlords.</p>

<p>If your landlord requires a deposit, you will have to pay this yourself –
the local authority will not pay it for you. In some circumstances, you may be
eligible to apply for <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/">assistance
from the Department of Social Protection</a> to help with paying a deposit.</p>

<h3>Ending a HAP tenancy</h3>

<p>You will be expected to stay in your HAP accommodation for at least 2 years,
but in some situations you may be able to apply for a new HAP payment elsewhere
– for example, if you are offered a job in another town or if your family
grows too large for the property. You will need to contact your local authority
if you are thinking of moving.</p>

<p>If a tenant or a landlord wishes to end a residential tenancy, they must <a href="if_your_landlord_wants_you_to_leave.html">comply with the relevant
legislation</a>. Read more on <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/advice/ending-a-tenancy/">Threshold’s
website</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l4292e">Rent limits</h2>

<p>In general, the rent must be within the prescribed HAP rent limits for your
household size and the area you live in. However, flexibility of up to 20% may
be provided, on a case-by-case basis, where a household cannot find suitable
accommodation within these limits. As noted above, there is also specific
flexibility, on a case-by-case basis, for <a href="http://www.homelessdublin.ie/housing-assistance-payment-homeless-households">eligible
homeless households</a> in the Dublin region. </p>

<p>The current limits are stated in the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/si/56/made/en/print">Housing
Assistance Payment (Amendment) Regulations 2017</a>. </p>

<p>This table shows the maximum monthly rent limits allowable in each local
authority area for different types of household.</p>

<p>If you are not yet on your local authority’s housing list, you will need
to <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/applying_for_local_authority_housing.html">apply
for social housing support</a> in the usual way.</p>

<p>If you are homeless in the Dublin region, contact the Dublin Place Finder
Service on <a href="mailto:placefinders@dublincity.ie">placefinders@dublincity.ie</a> or
contact the homeless section of your <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local
authority</a>. </p>

<p>If you are already on the housing list, you can ask the local authority for
a HAP application form. This form only needs to be filled in when you have
found suitable accommodation, or if you are already in private rented
accommodation and eligible to transfer to HAP. Your landlord will need to
complete and sign part of the HAP application form.</p>

<p>If you are in any doubt about whether your tenancy arrangement qualifies for
HAP, check with your local authority, which can advise you on this. </p>

<p>If you are approved for HAP, you then sign a Rent Contribution Agreement
with the local authority. You may be asked for a copy of the rental agreement
with your landlord.</p>

<p>If you have been on Rent Supplement for a long time, the Department of
Social Protection may ask you to contact your <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local
authority</a> about transferring to HAP.</p>

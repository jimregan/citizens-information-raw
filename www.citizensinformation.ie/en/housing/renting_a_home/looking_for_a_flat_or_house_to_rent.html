<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>This document outlines some points that you may wish to consider when
looking for private rented accommodation.</p>

<p>Before viewing accommodation you should consider:</p>
<ul><li>How much you can afford in rent and utility bills</li>
  <li>The quality of the accommodation</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.seai.ie/Your_Building/BER/">Building Energy
    Rating (BER)</a> of the property</li>
  <li>The location of the property</li>
  <li>How long you plan to stay there</li>
  <li>Whether you wish to share a bedroom/bathroom/kitchen etc.</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l0d031">Finding private rented accommodation</h2>

<p>Most rooms, flats, apartments or houses are advertised on accommodation
websites. You can search for a particular type of accommodation and set up
alerts for your specific requirements.</p>

<p>Other sources include the accommodation sections of newspapers;
advertisements in shops; college notice boards etc. Most student unions keep
accommodation lists as well. You may also find available accommodation through
word of mouth or 'To Let' signs on properties.</p>

<p>Accommodation agencies or letting agencies are commercial organisations that
help you find private rented accommodation. They may charge you a fee. Before
registering with an agency, you should find out:</p>
<ul><li>Is the agency licensed? </li>
  <li>What services does it offer? </li>
  <li>If you pay a fee, in what circumstances will you be entitled to a refund?
  </li>
  <li>If you decide to register with the agency, make sure you get a receipt
    for any money you pay. </li>
</ul><h3>Viewing a flat or house</h3>

<p><a href="repairs_maintenance_and_minimum_physical_standards.html">Minimum
standards</a> apply to accommodation being offered for rent. You may find the
following viewing checklist helpful:</p>
<ul><li>Are there any signs of dampness? </li>
  <li>Do the windows open? </li>
  <li>What security is available (such as window locks, burglar alarm)? </li>
  <li>Is a smoke detector provided and is it functioning? </li>
  <li>Is there a fire alarm? Check fire evacuation procedures (especially in
    apartments)</li>
  <li>Who pays for the heating? What hours is it on, and who controls it? </li>
  <li>Is hot water available all or some of the time? </li>
  <li>Are the cooker and fridge clean and in working order? </li>
  <li>What sort of condition is the bathroom in? </li>
  <li>Do you have to share the bathroom, if so, with how many others? </li>
  <li>Is there storage for bicycles?</li>
  <li>Does the property have a parking space? Threshold recommends that you get
    confirmation that a parking space is provided with the accommodation in
    writing from your letting agent or landlord before handing over any money.
  </li>
  <li>Is there a bus route or other public transport nearby? </li>
  <li>Are there shops and other facilities nearby? </li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="ldd905">Before you agree to rent</h2>

<p>Make sure that you can afford the rent being asked, either from your own
income or with available State support, such as Rent Supplement, Housing
Assistance Payment (HAP) or the <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/rental_accommodation_scheme.html">Rental
Accommodation Scheme (RAS)</a>. </p>

<p>If you will be claiming <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a> or <a href="housing_assistance_payment.html">HAP</a>, make
sure that you know the local maximum rent level allowed. There is some
flexibility in certain situations, allowing for higher rents to be covered.</p>

<h3>Discrimination when letting residential property</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_2000_0008.HTM">Equal
Status Acts 2000–2015</a> apply to lettings and accommodation. Landlords
cannot discriminate against potential tenants on grounds of gender, civil
status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race or
membership of the Traveller community.</p>

<p>Since 1 January 2016, you cannot be discriminated against when renting
because you are getting Rent Supplement or any other social welfare payment, or
a Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). This means that landlords can no longer
state when advertising accommodation that HAP (or Rent Supplement) is not
accepted and they cannot refuse to rent you accommodation because you are
getting a social welfare payment. If you feel you have been discriminated
against by a landlord or their agent, you can find out more about <a href="../../employment/enforcement_and_redress/equality_tribunal.html">making
a complaint under the Equal Status Acts</a>. </p>

<p>Read more on the website of the <a href="http://www.ihrec.ie/your-rights/housing-assistance.html">Irish Human
Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC)</a>. </p>

<h3>Rights and obligations</h3>

<p>Be aware of <a shape="rect" href="tenants_rights_and_obligations.html">your
rights and your obligations as a tenant</a> and your <a shape="rect" href="landlords_rights_and_obligations.html">landlord's rights and
obligations</a>. Your landlord, for example, is obliged to provide you with a
<a shape="rect" href="rent_books.html">rent book</a> and to ensure that the
accommodation meets certain <a shape="rect" href="repairs_maintenance_and_minimum_physical_standards.html">minimum physical
standards</a>. They must also <a shape="rect" href="registering_a_tenancy.html">register the tenancy</a> with the <a shape="rect" href="private_residential_tenancies_board.html">Residential
Tenancies Board (RTB)</a>.</p>

<p>If the landlord wants you to sign a fixed-term lease, don't agree unless you
are sure you want to stay for that length of time. If you leave before the end
of a fixed-term lease, you may lose your deposit. </p>

<p>Your tenancy is are not covered by landlord and tenant legislation if you
are renting a <strong>room</strong> in your landlord's home, but it is covered
if you are renting a self-contained apartment or flat. Read more in our
document on <a href="sharing_accommodation_with_your_landlord.html">Sharing
accommodation with your landlord</a>. </p>

<h3>Inventory</h3>

<p>Ask the landlord for a written list of all furnishings and appliances
provided. You and the landlord should sign this list at the start of the
tenancy to show that you agree on the furnishings supplied and their condition.
This will help to prevent disputes during your stay and when you are leaving.
This list should be included in the rent book.</p>

<p>If there are any signs of damage by previous tenants, make sure this is
noted too. You could photograph or otherwise record the existing condition of
the property and any damage to walls, furniture or appliances</p>

<p>If there are outstanding repairs, ask the landlord to state in writing that
they will be carried out.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lb14b4">Deposits</h2>

<h3>Holding deposits</h3>

<p>Some landlords or agents may ask you for a holding deposit when you decide
to take the accommodation. This is a sum of money you pay to hold the property
for you before you sign the lease and enter into a contract with the landlord.
You should always get a written receipt for a holding deposit. Holding deposits
are often not refundable if you don’t take up the accommodation.</p>

<h3>Security deposits</h3>

<p>You will be asked for a security deposit before moving into the
accommodation. Usually a deposit is the equivalent of 1 month’s rent and is
held by the landlord as security for any rent arrears or damage beyond normal
wear and tear. If you are getting a social welfare payment and are unable to
pay the deposit, the Department of Social Protection’s representative
(formerly the Community Welfare Officer) may be able to <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/exceptional_needs_payments.html">help
with paying a deposit under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme</a>. You
should get a receipt for any deposit you pay. The amount of deposit paid should
be stated in your <a href="rent_books.html">rent book</a>. You may lose your
deposit if:</p>
<ul><li>You leave without giving proper notice, or leave before the end of a
    fixed-term lease </li>
  <li>You cause damage to the accommodation beyond normal wear and tear </li>
  <li>You leave with bills or rent unpaid. </li>
</ul></div>

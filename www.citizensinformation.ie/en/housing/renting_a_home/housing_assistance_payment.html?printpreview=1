<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a form of social housing support for
people who have a long-term housing need. It is being administered by local
authorities and will eventually replace long-term <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a> - see 'Further information' below. HAP is being introduced under
the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0021/index.html">Housing
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014</a> and a series of Statutory
Instruments.</p>

<h3>Changes in July 2016</h3>

<p>The maximum rent limits allowable for HAP tenancies have been <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pressoffice/Pages/pr280616.aspx">increased with
effect from 1 July 2016</a>. Read more in ‘Rent’ below. </p>

<h3>Summary of scheme</h3>

<p>The HAP scheme aims to:</p>
<ul><li>Allow all social housing supports be accessed through one body - the
    local authority</li>
  <li>Allow people getting HAP to take up full-time employment and keep their
    housing support</li>
</ul><p>Under the HAP scheme, local authorities pay landlords directly. Tenants pay
a weekly HAP rent contribution to the local authority, based on their income
and ability to pay – see ‘Rent’ below.</p>

<p>There is <a href="http://www.environ.ie/housing/social-housing/housing-assistance-payment/housing-assistance-payment">detailed
information about HAP on environ.ie</a>, including booklets for <a href="http://www.environ.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/hap_landlord_information_booklet_eng_v3_2016.pdf">landlords
(pdf)</a> and <a href="http://www.environ.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/hap_tenant_information_booklet_eng_v3_2016.pdf">tenants
(pdf)</a>, along with a <a href="http://www.environ.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/hap_leaflet_eng-ire_v3_2016_hi_res_0.pdf">general
information leaflet (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Discrimination when letting residential property</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/law_and_rights/irish_human_rights_commission.html"></a>The
<a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_2000_0008.HTM">Equal
Status Acts 2000–2015</a> apply to lettings and accommodation. Landlords
cannot discriminate against potential tenants on grounds of gender, civil
status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race or
membership of the Traveller community.</p>

<p>Since 1 January 2016, you <a href="http://www.ihrec.ie/your-rights/housing-assistance.html">cannot be
discriminated against when renting because you are getting one of certain
payments</a>, which include HAP, so landlords can no longer state when
advertising accommodation that HAP is not accepted. If you feel you have been
discriminated against by a landlord or their agent, you can <a href="../../employment/enforcement_and_redress/equality_tribunal.html">make
a complaint under the Equal Status Acts</a>. </p>

<h3>Where does HAP operate?</h3>

<p>HAP is currently operational in the following local authority areas and is
being extended to all local authorities on a phased basis:</p>
<ul><li>Carlow County Council</li>
  <li>Clare County Council</li>
  <li>Cork City Council</li>
  <li>Cork County Council</li>
  <li>Donegal County Council</li>
  <li>Galway City Council</li>
  <li>Galway County Council</li>
  <li>Kilkenny County Council</li>
  <li>Kildare County Council</li>
  <li>Limerick City and County Council</li>
  <li>Louth County Council</li>
  <li>Mayo County Council</li>
  <li>Meath County Council</li>
  <li>Monaghan County Council</li>
  <li>Offaly County Council</li>
  <li>Sligo County Council</li>
  <li>South Dublin County Council</li>
  <li>Tipperary County Council</li>
  <li>Waterford City and County Council 
    <p>also</p>
  </li>
  <li>Homeless households in Dublin (Dublin City Council, Dún
    Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council and South Dublin
    County Council) </li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l03f83">Who is eligible for HAP?</h2>

<p>You must be on the local authority’s housing list – which means that you
qualify for social housing support. See our document on <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/applying_for_local_authority_housing.html">applying
for local authority housing</a> for details of assessment for social housing
support. </p>

<p>People who are on the housing list and are currently getting Rent Supplement
will be transferred to HAP on a phased basis. They are eligible to apply for
HAP at present, without waiting to be transferred. However, you do not have to
be getting Rent Supplement in order to qualify for HAP – but you must be on
the housing list. </p>

<p>You cannot transfer from any other form of social housing to HAP.</p>

<p>Under HAP you must find your own private rented accommodation - the local
authority will not source it for you. </p>

<p>Although the local authority administers the HAP scheme, you will not be a
local authority tenant. The rental agreement will be between yourself and the
private landlord and your tenancy will be covered by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/enacted/en/html">Residential
Tenancies Act 2004</a> (recently amended by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/42/enacted/en/html">Residential
Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015</a>). This means that you will have certain <a href="tenants_rights_and_obligations.html">rights and obligations</a>, as
will <a href="landlords_rights_and_obligations.html">your landlord</a>. </p>

<h3>HAP for homeless households</h3>

<p>In December 2014, HAP was extended on a pilot basis to homeless households
in the Dublin region. This decision was implemented by <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/si/0575.html">Regulations</a>. To
qualify for HAP under the pilot scheme, a household must be accepted as
homeless within the meaning of <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1988/act/28/section/2/enacted/en/html">section
2 of the Housing Act 1988</a> by one of the 4 Dublin local authorities. The
original requirement to have been in homeless accommodation on a certain date
is no longer in effect. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.homelessdublin.ie/housing-assistance-payment-homeless-households">Homeless
HAP Pilot</a>, which is operated by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE)
on behalf of the Dublin local authorities, provides discretion to exceed the
HAP rent limits for homeless households, if this is necessary in order to
source suitable accommodation. The <a href="http://www.homelessdublin.ie/housing-assistance-payment">Dublin Place
Finder Service</a> supports homeless households in the Dublin region to find a
tenancy using HAP. </p>

<h3>Rent</h3>

<p>You will pay a weekly HAP rent contribution to the local authority, based on
your household’s weekly income, calculated in the same way as standard <a href="http://www.housing.ie/housing-information/what-is-social-housing/renting-from-my-local-authority.aspx">local
authority differential rents</a>. This rent will vary in accordance with your
income and the local authority’s rent scheme.</p>

<p>In the same way as anyone else who is paying a differential rent, you will
have to notify the local authority of any changes in your income or household
size, so that the rent can be recalculated.</p>

<p>If you take up a job or increase your working hours, you will still be
eligible for HAP if you fulfil the other conditions of the scheme. This is
different from the rules that apply to Rent Supplement.</p>

<p><strong>Rent limits</strong></p>

<p>In general, the rent must be within the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/si/338/made/en/pdf">HAP rent
limits for your household size and the area you live in (pdf)</a>. However,
there is flexibility of up to 20% where suitable accommodation cannot be found
for a household within these limits. As noted above, there is also specific
flexibility for homeless households in the Dublin region.</p>

<h3>Paying your landlord</h3>

<p>The local authority will make the HAP payment to your landlord on your
behalf, subject to certain conditions:</p>
<ul><li>You must pay your weekly HAP rent contribution to the local authority –
    if not, the local authority will stop paying your landlord</li>
  <li>If you get a social welfare payment at a post office, you must pay your
    HAP contribution through the <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/household_budget_scheme.html">Household
    Budget Scheme</a> </li>
  <li>The accommodation must meet <a href="repairs_maintenance_and_minimum_physical_standards.html">minimum
    standards for rented housing</a></li>
  <li>Your landlord must have current evidence of tax compliance </li>
  <li>You (and your household) must not engage in <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/anti_social_behaviour.html">anti-social
    behaviour</a></li>
</ul><p>If your landlord requires a deposit, you will have to pay this yourself –
the local authority will not pay it for you. You may be able to get an <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/exceptional_needs_payments.html">Exceptional
Needs Payment</a> to help with paying the deposit.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l6fe88">When you are renting under HAP</h2>

<p>In general, under the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2015, all private
residential tenancies must be <a href="registering_a_tenancy.html">registered with the Residential Tenancies
Board</a>. </p>

<p>The local authority will inspect your accommodation within 8 months of the
first HAP payment to your landlord, to ensure that it meets the required
standards. The landlord is also required to produce evidence of tax
compliance.</p>

<p>Your housing needs will have been met under HAP and you will no longer be on
the local authority’s housing waiting list. However, if you wish to have
access to other social housing supports, such as local authority housing or
housing provided by a <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/housing_associations.html">housing
association</a>, you can apply to the local authority for a transfer.</p>

<p>If you do apply for a transfer <strong>within 2 weeks of getting the letter
confirming your HAP payment</strong>, any time that you spent on the housing
list can be taken into account when your local authority considers your
application. If you apply for a transfer at a later date, the time that you
previously spent on the housing waiting list won’t count. </p>

<p>You will be expected to stay in your HAP accommodation for at least 2 years,
but in some situations you may be able to apply for a new HAP payment elsewhere
– for example, if you are offered a job in another town or if your family
grows too large for the property. You will need to contact the local authority
in the new area. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you are not yet on your local authority’s housing list, you will need
to <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/applying_for_local_authority_housing.html">apply
for social housing support</a> in the usual way.</p>

<p>If you are homeless in the Dublin region, contact the Dublin Place Finder
Service on <a href="mailto:placefinders@dublincity.ie">placefinders@dublincity.ie</a> or
contact the homeless section of your <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local
authority</a>. </p>

<p>If you are already on the housing list, and if HAP is operating in your
area, you can ask the local authority for a HAP application form. This form
only needs to be filled in when you have found suitable accommodation, or if
you are already in private rented accommodation and eligible to transfer to
HAP. Your landlord will need to complete and sign part of the HAP application
form.</p>

<p>If you are in any doubt about whether your tenancy arrangement qualifies for
HAP, check with your local authority, which can advise you on this. </p>

<p>If you are approved for HAP, you then sign a Rent Contribution Agreement
with the local authority. You may be asked for a copy of the rental agreement
with your landlord.</p>

<p>If you have been on Rent Supplement for a long time, the Department of
Social Protection may ask you to contact your <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local
authority</a> about transferring to HAP.</p>

<h2 class="further_info" id="l23f7d">Further information</h2>

<p><a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a> was originally designed as a support for people who needed
short-term help with their rent, for example, if they had lost their job.
However, many people who are currently on Rent Supplement have been assessed as
having a long-term housing need, and as a result they are on local authority
housing lists.</p>

<p>HAP will eventually replace Rent Supplement for people with a long-term
housing need, though Rent Supplement will continue to be available for people
who need short-term support to pay their rent.</p>

<p>In general, you cannot get Rent Supplement if you are in full-time
employment or self-employment (30 hours or more a week). However, people on HAP
can take up full-time employment, subject to the conditions of the scheme.</p>

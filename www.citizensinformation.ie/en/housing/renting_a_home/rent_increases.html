<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The amount of rent payable for a property is agreed between the landlord and
tenant at the start of a tenancy. Private landlords must follow certain
procedures if they want to raise the rent. The rules are set out in Part 3 of
the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/enacted/en/html">Residential
Tenancies Act 2004</a>. They have recently been amended by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/42/enacted/en/html">Residential
Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015</a> and the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/act/17/schedule/enacted/en/html">Planning
and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016</a>. </p>

<p>These rules only apply to private rented housing, not to housing that is let
by <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing">local authorities</a> or <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/housing_associations.html">approved
housing bodies</a> (housing associations), both of which charge differential
rents based on household income. While approved housing bodies now come under
the residential tenancies legislation, their rent reviews will continue to be
carried out in accordance with their tenancy agreements, or no more than once
in any 12-month period. </p>

<h3>Rent Predictability Measure</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.housing.gov.ie/strategy-for-the-rental-sector">Strategy for
the Rental Sector</a> proposed a Rent Predictability Measure, to cap rent
increases at 4% per year for the next 3 years in designated Rent Pressure
Zones. <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=33811&amp;&amp;CatID=59">The
Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016</a>
brought this measure into effect from 24 December 2016. It was implemented
immediately in the 4 Dublin local authority areas and in Cork city. <a href="http://www.housing.gov.ie/housing/private-rented-housing/coveney-designates-new-rent-pressure-zones">Several
further towns and all of Galway city</a> have also been designated as Rent
Pressure Zones, with effect from 27 January 2017.</p>

<p>With effect from 30 March 2017, <a href="http://www.housing.gov.ie/housing/private-rented-housing/coveney-announces-further-rent-pressure-zones-and-launches-expanded">Maynooth
and Cobh</a> have also been designated as Rent Pressure Zones.</p>

<p>Rent Pressure Zones are to be designated for a maximum of 3 years.</p>

<p>There is <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/search-results/news/article/2016/12/23/rental-predictability-measures-introduced">more
about this and other new measures</a> on rtb.ie, including a set of <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/docs/default-source/legislative-changes/rent-predictability-faqs.pdf?sfvrsn=2">FAQs

<h3>Residential Tenancies Board</h3>

<p>The <a href="private_residential_tenancies_board.html">Residential
Tenancies Board (RTB)</a> has a central role in supporting the rented housing
market. It deals with <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/dispute-resolution/disputes">disputes between
landlords and tenants</a>, including disputes about rent reviews. It also
provides <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/dispute-resolution/disputes/the-three-stages-of-a-tenancy/rent-reviews">information
about rent reviews and increases</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l4b62a">Market rent</h2>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0027/sec0019.html#sec19">Section
19 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004</a>, landlords cannot charge more than
the open market rate of rent. <em>Market rent</em> (for properties outside Rent
Pressure Zones) is defined in <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0027/sec0024.html#sec24">Section
24</a> as ‘the rent which a willing tenant not already in occupation would
give and a willing landlord would take for the dwelling’. The RTB publishes a
quarterly <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/landlords/rent-index-dec-2014">index of
rents</a>, which you can use to check current market rents. Read <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/dispute-resolution/disputes/the-three-stages-of-a-tenancy/what-is-market-rent-">more
about market rent and the rent index</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l2fdf7">Rent reviews</h2>

<p>A rent review can result in an increase or reduction of the rent. In
general, your landlord has the right to <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/dispute-resolution/disputes/the-three-stages-of-a-tenancy/rent-reviews">review
the rent</a> once every 2 years. Unless the accommodation has changed
substantially, it cannot be reviewed more often than this, unless it is in a
Rent Pressure Zone.</p>

<p><strong>Rent Pressure Zones:</strong> Under the Rent Predictability Measure,
a number of Rent Pressure Zones have been designated. Rent increases in these
zones are capped and there are limits on how often the rent can increase. The
first such zones were the areas covered by:</p>
<ul><li>Dublin City Council</li>
  <li>South Dublin County Council</li>
  <li>Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council</li>
  <li>Fingal County Council and</li>
  <li>Cork City Council</li>
</ul><p><a href="http://www.rtb.ie/search-results/news/article/2017/01/27/minister-extends-rent-pressure-zones-to-12-additional-local-electoral-areas">Further
Rent Pressure Zones were designated</a> with effect from 27 January 2017. <a href="http://www.housing.gov.ie/housing/private-rented-housing/coveney-announces-further-rent-pressure-zones-and-launches-expanded">Maynooth
and Cobh</a> were designated with effect from 30 March 2017. </p>

<p><strong>For a new tenancy</strong> (starting on or after 24 December 2016)
in a Rent Pressure Zone, the landlord may raise the rent once every 12 months.
The maximum rent increase will be 4% per year. The landlord must give the
tenant the following information, in writing, at the start of the tenancy:</p>
<ul><li>The amount of rent that was last set under a tenancy for the dwelling</li>
  <li>The date the rent was last set under a tenancy for the dwelling</li>
  <li>A statement as to how the rent set under the tenancy of the dwelling has
    been calculated, having regard to the Rent Pressure Zone formula</li>
</ul><p><strong>In existing tenancies</strong> (starting before 24 December 2016)
the first rent review in a Rent Pressure Zone may take place a minimum of 24
months after the previous time the rent was set. The maximum rent increase will
be 4% (which amounts to 2% per year since the previous rent was set).
Subsequent rent reviews may take place after a minimum period of 12 months. </p>

<p><strong>Exceptions:</strong> Properties that have not been let at any time
in the previous 2 years, or that have been substantially refurbished, can be
exempted from these caps. However, the rent set for a property must be in line
with market rent for similar properties in the area.</p>

<p><strong>Outside of Rent Pressure Zones:</strong> Your rent cannot be
increased until 24 months after the start of your tenancy. If your rent was
reviewed at any time in the last 24 months, it cannot be reviewed again until
24 months after the date of the last review.</p>

<h3>Calculating allowable rent increases</h3>

<p>You can use <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/rent-pressure-zones/rpz-calculator">the RTB’s
calculator</a> to check whether your dwelling is in a Rent Pressure Zone and to
work out whether the rent can be raised and, if so, by how much. You will need
to enter your address or <a href="../../consumer_affairs/telecommunications_and_postal_services/eircode.html">Eircode</a>,
the current rent and the date when the rent was last set.</p>

<p>The RTB has published <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/docs/default-source/legislative-changes/examples-of-how-the-rent-pressure-zone-formula-works.pdf?sfvrsn=0">examples
(pdf)</a> of how the calculations work.</p>

<h3>Notice of rent review</h3>

<p>Your landlord must give you proper notice of the amount of the proposed new
rent and the date from which it is to take effect. The notice must be in
writing and contain the information prescribed by the legislation – see
‘Notice of rent review’ below. Emails, text messages and spoken messages
are not valid forms of notice.</p>

<p>You must get at least 90 days’ notice of a rent review.</p>

<p>The landlord must also notify the RTB of the revised rent so that it can
update the registration details of the tenancy.</p>

<p>The notice of new rent must comply with the provisions of <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/42/section/26/enacted/en/html#sec26">Section
26</a> of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015. The notice must:</p>
<ul><li>State the amount of new rent and the date from which is to have
  effect</li>
  <li>Include a statement that any dispute about the setting of the rent must
    be referred to the RTB before the date the new rent takes effect, or within
    28 days from the date that the tenant gets the notice, whichever is the
    later</li>
  <li>Include a statement by the landlord that, in their opinion, the new rent
    is not greater than the market rent, having regard to the other terms of
    the tenancy and to letting values of dwellings of a similar size, type and
    character and situated in a comparable area</li>
  <li>Specify the rent amount being asked for 3 dwellings of a similar size,
    type and character and in a comparable area, which have been advertised for
    rent in the 4-week period immediately before the notice</li>
  <li>Be signed by the landlord or their authorised agent and include the date
    on which it was signed</li>
</ul><p>In a Rent Pressure Zone, the notice must also comply with <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/42/section/26/enacted/en/html#sec26">Section
35</a> of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act
2016.</p>
<ul><li>In a Rent Pressure Zone, the landlord must also provide information and
    calculations to demonstrate that the rent increase is not more than 4% per
    year for the period since the rent was last set.</li>
</ul><p>The RTB has published a <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/docs/default-source/legislative-changes/sample-notice-of-rent-review.docx">sample
notice of rent review</a>, which includes the extra information required in
Rent Pressure Zones. </p>

<h3>Requesting a rent review</h3>

<p>As a tenant, you can ask your landlord to review the rent if:</p>
<ul><li>You think it is more than the current market rate for the property or</li>
  <li>You want a new review and more than 24 months have passed</li>
</ul></div>

<p>Threshold, the national housing charity, publishes detailed advice on <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/advice/dealing-with-problems-during-your-tenancy/how-to-deal-with-rent-increases/">how
to deal with rent increases</a>. Its <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/download/pdf/thresholdresolvingjan2017.pdf">leaflet
on resolving problems during your tenancy (pdf)</a> includes tips on dealing
with rent increases. You can contact Threshold for advice on your particular
situation – see ‘Where to apply’ below’.</p>

<p>If there is any dispute about the amount of rent being proposed, either side
can <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/dispute-resolution/disputes/dispute-resolution-process-faqs">refer
the dispute to the RTB</a>. If you are claiming that the proposed rent is
higher than the market rate, you should provide evidence of rental rates for
similar properties in the same area.</p>

<p>If the landlord has given you a valid written notice of the rent increase,
you must contact the RTB with your dispute before the date that the new rent
comes into effect or within 28 days of getting the notice, whichever is later.
There is no time limit if the notice is not valid.</p>

<p>You must continue to pay your rent until the case has been determined by the
RTB.</p>

<h3>Protecting your tenancy</h3>

<p>You can contact Threshold’s <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/housing-supports/dublin.html">Tenancy Protection
Service</a> on 1800 454 454 for general support, advice and advocacy around

<p>There may be flexibility in cases where landlords seek rents that are above
the <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a> limits. This applies to existing tenants and to new Rent
Supplement applicants. The circumstances of tenants are considered on a
case-by-case basis and rents increased above the set limits as appropriate.
Contact <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/otheroffice/community-welfare-office-contact.aspx">the
local office that administers your Rent Supplement</a>.</p>

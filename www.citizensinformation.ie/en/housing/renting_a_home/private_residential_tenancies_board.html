<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l07de2">Introduction </h2>

<p>The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was set up under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0027/index.html">Residential
Tenancies Act 2004</a>. Its name was changed to the Residential Tenancies Board
(RTB) on 7 April 2016, when approved housing bodies (generally known as <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/housing_associations.html">housing
associations</a>) were brought under its remit by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/42/enacted/en/html">Residential
Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015</a>. </p>

<p>The RTB's main functions are:</p>
<ul><li>Maintaining a register of private residential tenancies and tenancies of
    approved housing bodies </li>
  <li>Providing a dispute resolution service for tenants and landlords
    (including approved housing bodies)</li>
  <li>Carrying out research into the private rented sector</li>
</ul><p>It also provides policy advice to the Government on the private rented
sector.</p>

<h3>Residential Tenancies Acts</h3>

<p>The Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2015 deal with the regulation of the
mainstream private rented housing sector and the approved housing body sector.
They set out the rights and obligations of both <a href="landlords_rights_and_obligations.html">landlords</a> and <a href="tenants_rights_and_obligations.html">tenants</a> in these sectors. They
do not apply to certain types of rented property – see ‘Exclusions from
scope of Acts’ below.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="ld79cb">Services provided by the RTB</h2>

<h3>Registration of tenancies </h3>

<p>The PRTB maintains a <a href="https://portal.prtb.ie/public_registrations.aspx">national register of
tenancies</a>. All private residential tenancies must be registered and there
are penalties for landlords who do not register. Since 7 April 2016, approved
housing bodies are required to register new and existing tenancies. Read more
in our document on <a href="registering_a_tenancy.html">registering a
tenancy</a>.</p>

<p>The RTB can share information with local authorities, which enforce the
regulations relating to <a href="repairs_maintenance_and_minimum_physical_standards.html">standards</a>
and <a href="rent_books.html">rent books</a>. It can also share information
with the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/">Department of Social Protection</a>
and the <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/index.html">Revenue
Commissioners</a>.</p>

<h3>Dispute resolution </h3>

<p>The RTB provides a confidential dispute resolution service. You can initiate
the dispute resolution process if you are a tenant, a landlord or are otherwise
directly affected by a problem (for example, if you are a neighbour). A
landlord who has not registered the tenancy with the RTB cannot use the dispute
resolution service, but their tenant(s) can use it.</p>

and on the <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/dispute-resolution">RTB’s
website</a>.</p>

<h3>Research and information</h3>

<p>The RTB has published a number of <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/media-research/research-reports">research reports</a>
on issues in the private rented sector and it also publishes a quarterly <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/landlords/rent-index">Rent Index</a>. It provides a
wide range of information for <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/tenants">tenants</a>,
<a href="http://www.prtb.ie/landlords">landlords</a> and agents, along with <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/media-research/publications">sample forms and other
publications</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="ld5d0e">Exclusions from scope of Acts</h2>

<p>The Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2015 <strong>do not apply</strong> to
the following types of rented property:</p>
<ul><li>Business lettings </li>
  <li>Holiday lettings </li>
  <li>Formerly rent-controlled dwellings or long occupation lease tenancies –
    separate legislation applies to them </li>
  <li><a href="sharing_accommodation_with_your_landlord.html">A
    <strong>room</strong> that you rent in your landlord's home</a> </li>
  <li>Dwellings in which the spouse, parent or child of the landlord lives.
    This applies to informal family arrangements where there is no tenancy
    agreement in writing. However, the Act does cover formal agreements between
    family members, for example where a lease has been signed </li>
  <li><a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/">Local authority
    housing</a> </li>
</ul><p><strong>Part 4 of the Act</strong> (which deals with <a href="types_of_tenancy.html">security of tenure</a>) does not apply to:</p>
<ul><li>Employment-related lettings – these are sometimes called 'tied' houses
    in that they are tied to the job and you must leave the dwelling when the
    job ends, and </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/practitioner/tech-guide/stud_accom.pdf">Section
    50 student accommodation (pdf) </a></li>
  <li>Transitional dwellings let by housing associations</li>
</ul><p>Also, if you are renting a flat or apartment that was originally part of the
landlord's main house, your landlord can choose to opt out of the Part 4
provisions on security of tenure. Read more in our document on <a href="sharing_accommodation_with_your_landlord.html">Sharing accommodation

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0027/index.html" shape="rect">Residential Tenancies Act 2004</a> and he <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/42/enacted/en/html">Residential
Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015</a>, landlords must register residential
tenancies with the <a href="private_residential_tenancies_board.html">Residential Tenancies Board
(RTB)</a>. </p>

<p>The <acronym title=" Private Residential Tenancies Board">RTB</acronym> uses
this information to maintain a <a href="https://portal.prtb.ie/public_registrations.aspx">publicly available
register</a>. The register does not show the identity of the landlord or the
tenants, or the amount of the rent. </p>

<p>The RTB was formerly called the Private Residential Tenancies Board. Its
name was changed on 7 April 2016, when approved housing bodies (generally known
as <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/housing_associations.html">housing
associations</a>) came under its remit. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l0eafd">What tenancies must be registered?</h2>

<p>The Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2015 apply to most privately rented
dwellings and to dwellings rented out by housing associations, and require them
to be registered with the RTB. Housing associations must register all their
tenancies within 12 months of 7 April 2016 – the date that they came under
the RTB’s remit.</p>

<p>The Acts <strong>do not apply</strong> to the following types of rented
property:</p>
<ul><li>Business lettings</li>
  <li>Holiday lettings</li>
  <li>Formerly rent-controlled dwellings or long-occupation lease tenancies –
    separate legislation applies to them</li>
  <li>Owner-occupied accommodation (for example, if you <a href="sharing_accommodation_with_your_landlord.html">rent a room in your
    landlord's home</a>)</li>
  <li>Dwellings in which the spouse, parent or child of the landlord lives.
    This applies to informal family arrangements where there is no tenancy
    agreement in writing. However, the Acts do cover formal agreements between
    family members, for example where a lease has been signed</li>
  <li><a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/applying_for_local_authority_housing.html">Social
    housing</a> provided by local authorities (though, as noted above, the
    voluntary housing sector has been included since 7 April 2016)</li>
</ul><p><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/section/25/enacted/en/html#part4">Part
4</a> of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (which deals with <a href="types_of_tenancy.html">security of tenure</a>) does not apply to:</p>
<ul><li>Employment-related lettings – these are sometimes called ‘tied’
    houses as they are tied to the job and you must leave the dwelling when the
    job ends, and</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/practitioner/tech-guide/stud_accom.pdf">Section
    50 student accommodation (pdf)</a></li>
  <li><a href="sharing_accommodation_with_your_landlord.html">Tenancies in a
    landlord’s home</a> in a flat or apartment that was originally part of
    the main house, where the landlord has chosen to opt out of the provisions
    of Part 4 </li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>New tenancies must be registered within a month of the start of the tenancy.
<strong>Landlords are responsible for registration</strong>. The tenant must
give their details to the landlord, including their <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">Personal
Public Service Number (PPS Number)</a>.</p>

<p>When a tenancy has been in existence for 4 years or more, a new tenancy
begins. The landlord must re-register this new tenancy with the PRTB. Read more
in our document on <a href="types_of_tenancy.html">security of tenure</a>
and on <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/advice/dealing-with-problems-during-your-tenancy/security-of-tenure/">Threshold's
website</a>. </p>

<p>Private landlords and housing associations must supply the following
information when registering:</p>
<ul><li>The address of the rented dwelling </li>
  <li>The name, address and <acronym title="Personal Public Service Number ">PPS N</acronym>umber of the
    landlord (or registered number, if a company)</li>
  <li>The approved housing body (AHB) number, if a housing association </li>
  <li>The name and PPS Number <acronym title="Personal Public Service Number "></acronym>of each tenant </li>
  <li>A description of the dwelling (for example, a 2-reception, 3-bedroom
    semi-detached house) </li>
  <li>The date the tenancy started </li>
  <li>The rent and how often it is payable </li>
  <li>The local authority area the dwelling is located in </li>
  <li>The term of the lease if it is a fixed-term lease </li>
  <li>Whether it is a sub-letting</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.seai.ie/Your_Building/BER/">Building Energy Rating
    (BER)</a> if applicable</li>
  <li>Details of any management company or authorised agent </li>
</ul><p>Each tenancy is allocated a Registered Tenancy (RT) number. The RTB issues
confirmation letters to both the landlord and the tenant, containing this RT
number, which must be used in any dealings with the RTB.</p>

<h3>Changes in rent </h3>

<p>If the amount of rent changes, the landlord must tell the <acronym title="Private Residential Tenancies Board">RTB</acronym> of the change within
one month. Read more in our document on <a shape="rect" href="rent_increases.html">rent increases</a>. </p>

<h3>Is my tenancy registered?</h3>

<p>You can view the <a href="https://portal.prtb.ie/public_registrations.aspx">public register</a> to
check that your tenancy has been registered. The RTB can take action against
landlords who do not register tenancies. Read more on <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/tenants/is-my-tenancy-registered-">the RTB’s
website</a>.</p>

<p>Landlords can only use the <a href="disputes_between_landlords_and_tenants.html">RTB’s dispute
resolution service</a> if they have registered the tenancy. However, even if
your landlord hasn’t registered your tenancy, you can still avail of this
service.</p>

<h3>Information sharing</h3>

<p>The RTB can share information with local authorities, which enforce the
regulations relating to <a href="repairs_maintenance_and_minimum_physical_standards.html">standards</a>
and <a href="rent_books.html">rent books</a>. It can also share information
with the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/">Department of Social Protection</a>
and the <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/index.html">Revenue
Commissioners</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<h3>Private landlords</h3>

<p>Each registration costs €90. If you are registering a number of tenancies
in the same building at the same time, you can pay a composite fee of €375.
If a single registration is late, the fee is doubled. If a multiple
registration is late, the composite fee no longer applies and a fee of €180
applies for each tenancy being registered late.</p>

<p>Landlords who fail to register may be fined up to €3,000 and face
imprisonment for up to six months on conviction. A further penalty of €250
for each day of non-registration may be levied.</p>

<h3>Approved housing bodies</h3>

<p>For a period of 12 months from 7 April 2016, approved housing bodies
(housing associations) will be charged €45 for each tenancy registration.
During this period, the composite fee (for up to 10 multiple tenancies in the
same building) will be €187.50.</p>

<p>After this period, they will be subject to the same rates and penalties as
private landlords.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You can either <a href="https://portal.prtb.ie/" shape="rect">apply online
to register a tenancy</a>. There is a webchat service to help you with this
process. If you do not already have an account with the RTB, you will need to
create one. Alternatively, you can request a paper application form from the
RTB and send the completed form to the address below. </p>

<p>You need to provide detailed information on the property when you register
the tenancy (see above). The RTB publishes <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/landlords/registering-a-tenancy-what-you-need-to-provide">a
checklist of the information you need to provide</a>, along with <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/docs/default-source/prtb-reg-form-notes-(english)/prtb-registration-notes.pdf?sfvrsn=4">explanatory
notes (pdf)</a>.</p>

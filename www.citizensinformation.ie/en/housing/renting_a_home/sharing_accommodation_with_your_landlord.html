<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are renting a <strong>self-contained flat or apartment</strong> in
your landlord’s home, your tenancy is covered by the residential tenancies
legislation and your landlord must <a href="registering_a_tenancy.html">register it with the Residential Tenancies
Board</a>. However, if you are renting a <strong>room</strong> that is part of
your landlord's home, your tenancy is not covered by this legislation.</p>

<p>Your landlord may be entitled to <a href="../owning_a_home/home_owners/rent_a_room_scheme.html">Rent-a-room
relief</a>, whether you are renting a room or a self-contained dwelling.</p>

<p>In the same way as other tenants, you may be entitled to claim <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a> or <a href="housing_assistance_payment.html">Housing
Assistance Payment</a>. As part of the qualifying conditions for these rental
supports, you must be able to prove that the tenancy is genuine.</p>

<p>If you were already renting at 7 December 2010, whether in your current
tenancy or not, you may be able to <a href="tax_relief_for_tenants.html">claim tax relief</a> on the rent paid.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l2643c">Self-contained flat or apartment</h2>

<p>If you are renting a self-contained flat or apartment in your landlord’s
home, your tenancy is covered by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/enacted/en/index.html">Residential
Tenancies Act 2004</a> and the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/42/enacted/en/print.html">Residential
Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015</a>. You have certain rights and obligations
under this legislation and so does your landlord.</p>

<p>However, if your flat or apartment was originally part of the main house,
your landlord can choose to opt out of the provisions on <a href="types_of_tenancy.html">security of tenure</a>, which are in <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/section/25/enacted/en/html#part4">Part
4</a> of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004. This option is available under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/section/25/enacted/en/html#sec25">Section
25</a> of the Act. You must get notice in writing, before the start of the
tenancy, if the landlord wishes to take this option.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="la4956">Renting a room</h2>

<p>If you are renting a room in your landlord's home, your situation is very
different. You do not have a standard tenancy agreement. Instead, you have a
<em>licensee</em> agreement with your landlord. This means that you are in the
property by the landlord’s consent or invitation. As a result, you cannot
avail of the type of protection that tenants are entitled to under the
residential tenancies legislation.</p>

<p>The position is the same if you are living with a spouse, child or parent of
a landlord and you do not have a tenancy agreement or written lease.</p>

<p>As you do not have the same rights as someone whose tenancy comes under the
landlord and tenant legislation, you should be aware of the following:</p>
<ul><li>Your landlord is not obliged to provide you with a <a shape="rect" href="rent_books.html">rent book</a> or a statement of rent paid </li>
  <li>There is no legal requirement for your accommodation to meet <a shape="rect" href="repairs_maintenance_and_minimum_physical_standards.html">minimum
    physical standards</a> </li>
  <li>Any notice you may get of the termination of the tenancy is at your
    landlord's discretion (although the landlord is obliged to give reasonable
    notice, the specifics of this notice may vary)<em></em></li>
  <li>Your landlord is not obliged to <a href="registering_a_tenancy.html">register the tenancy</a> with the
    Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) </li>
  <li>You cannot use <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting_a_home/disputes_between_landlords_and_tenants.html#lbc6be">the
    RTB's dispute resolution service</a> if a disagreement arises between you
    and your landlord </li>
  <li>You are not protected by the <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_2000_0008.HTM">Equal
    Status Acts 2000-2015</a>, which prohibit discrimination on grounds of
    gender, civil status, family status, age, race, religion, disability,
    sexual orientation and membership of the Traveller community – and now
    also on the <a href="http://www.ihrec.ie/your-rights/housing-assistance.html">‘housing
    assistance’ ground</a></li>
</ul><h3>Agreement with your landlord</h3>

<p>Before you arrange to rent a room in your landlord’s home, it is strongly
recommended that the two of you agree some ground rules and put them in
writing. If you and your landlord each sign and keep a copy of this agreement,
you can both refer to its terms in the event of confusion or disagreement.
These ground rules might include:</p>
<ul><li>How long is the tenancy going to last? </li>
  <li>How much notice will either you or your landlord have to give if either
    of you chooses to end the tenancy? </li>
  <li>How much rent will you pay and how often (for example, weekly, monthly)?
  </li>
  <li>How will this rent be paid (cash, cheque, standing order etc.)? </li>
  <li>When will the rent to be reviewed and how much notice will your landlord
    give you of a rent review? </li>
  <li>How are utility bills (electricity, gas, phone, water) to be divided
    between yourself and the landlord? </li>
  <li>Will your landlord expect you to contribute towards refuse collection
    charges? </li>
  <li>Can you have visitors to stay overnight? </li>
  <li>Are there any restrictions regarding noise levels? </li>
</ul><h3>Resolving disputes</h3>

<p>If you are renting a room in your landlord’s home and are unhappy with the
way you are being treated, you should try discussing the situation with the
landlord and attempt to resolve any issues between you. You may wish to contact
Threshold, which provides information on housing rights – see 'Where to
apply' below. </p>

<p>If you have exhausted these options, you may be able to take your case to
the Small Claims Court. This is really the only legal recourse you have as a
tenant renting a room in your landlord’s home. </p>

<p>Common claims that are heard by the Small Claims Court include disputes
about retention of your deposit for what you consider unfair reasons, or
deductions from rent for damage to property that is over and above normal 'wear
and tear'. </p>

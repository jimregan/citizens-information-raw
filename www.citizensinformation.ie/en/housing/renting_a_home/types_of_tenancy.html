<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>When you rent your home from a private landlord or an approved housing body,
you have an agreement or contract with that person or body, known as a tenancy
agreement – which may or may not be in writing. The most common types of
tenancy are <em>fixed-term tenancies</em> and <em>periodic tenancies</em> –
both described in more detail below.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0027/print.html">Residential
Tenancies Act 2004</a> gave tenants the right to stay in rented accommodation
for up to 4 years, following an initial 6-month period (with some exceptions -
see below). This right applies to both periodic and fixed-term tenancies. Your
tenancy then becomes a <em>Part 4 tenancy</em> and can be followed by a
<em>further Part 4 tenancy</em> – both described below. </p>

<h3>Recent changes </h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/act/17/schedule/enacted/en/html">Planning
and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016</a> extended the
period of a Part 4 tenancy from 4 years to 6 years. This applies to all
tenancies created from 24 December 2016. Read more about this change on the <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/dispute-resolution/security-of-tenure">Residential
Tenancies Board’s website</a>.</p>

<p>The Act also changed the rules on <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/search-results/news/article/2017/01/19/further-changes-to-policy-and-the-law">termination
of a further Part 4 tenancy</a>, with effect from 17 January 2017.</p>

<h3>Scope of legislation</h3>

<p>If you are getting <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a>, you are probably renting from a private landlord, so you would
be covered by the residential tenancies legislation. It also covers tenancies
under the <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/rental_accommodation_scheme.html">Rental
Accommodation Scheme (RAS)</a> and the <a href="housing_assistance_payment.html">Housing Assistance Payment
(HAP)</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l3381e">Fixed-term tenancy</h2>

<p>A <em>fixed-term tenancy</em> is an agreement that covers a specific amount
of time. It is generally (but not always) set down in a written contract,
called a lease. It may be for any period, but can range from as little as 6
months up to a year or more. It is important to note the following points about
a fixed-term tenancy:</p>
<ul><li>Your landlord may not end the tenancy before the end of the fixed term
    unless you have breached your obligations under it</li>
  <li>In general, you may not end the tenancy before the end of the term unless
    the landlord has breached his obligations under it; you are exercising a
    break clause; you have got <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/advice/ending-a-tenancy/getting-someone-to-replace-you/">someone
    to replace you</a>; or you and the landlord both agree to end it</li>
  <li>However, if a private landlord* refuses to consent to an <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/dispute-resolution/disputes/the-three-stages-of-a-tenancy/what-is-assignment-">assignment</a>
    or <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/dispute-resolution/disputes/the-three-stages-of-a-tenancy/what-is-subletting-">sub-let</a>
    of the tenancy, you can terminate the tenancy under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0027/print.html#sec186">Section
    186 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004</a></li>
  <li>In general, you acquire security of tenure after 6 months – see ‘Part
    4 tenancy’ below</li>
  <li>If you wish to stay in the dwelling after the end of the fixed term, you
    must notify the landlord at least a month before the term expires</li>
</ul><p>*Tenants of approved housing bodies (housing associations) cannot assign or
sublet their tenancy, so this does not apply.</p>

<h3>Leases</h3>

<p>The lease will state how much rent you have to pay, how often you have to
pay it and other conditions. You are strongly advised to make sure that you
understand the terms of the lease before you sign it. A lease is a binding
contract between you and the landlord and contains important information on the
terms of your tenancy. In particular, it should state what will happen if
either of you breaks the terms of the agreement.</p>

<p>However, a lease should not contain terms that contradict the legal rights
of tenants and landlords. If this happens, your legal rights as a tenant or
landlord supersede the terms in the lease. For example, your landlord cannot
enter the property at any time without seeking your permission. This is the
case even if your lease states that the landlord may enter the property at any
time.</p>

<p>If you sign a lease together with other people, you each become responsible
for all the rent. So, if your fellow tenants cannot pay their share of the
rent, you may be legally liable for the entire amount. If you sign a lease on
your own on behalf of the other tenants, you become responsible for all the
rent.</p>

<p>If the yearly rent on the lease for residential accommodation is over
€30,000, the tenant is responsible for <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/stamp-duty/property.html">stamp duty</a> on
the annual rent. It is your responsibility as a tenant to pay this to <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/index.html">Revenue</a>.</p>

<p>Read <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/advice/seeking-private-rented-accommodation/do-i-have-to-sign-a-lease/">more
about leases</a> on the website of Threshold, the national housing charity.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l8d5d4">Periodic tenancy</h2>

<p>A <em>periodic</em> tenancy agreement does not specify a fixed length of
time. The period of the tenancy may be weekly or monthly, depending on how
often the rent is due. Periodic tenancy agreements may or may not be in
writing.</p>

<p>Your landlord may end the tenancy at any time during the first 6 months
without having to give a reason, but, in general, you acquire security of
tenure after 6 months – see ‘Part 4 tenancy’ below. You must always get a
valid written notice of termination and there are detailed rules about the
period of notice that must be given, depending on the length of the tenancy
(with some exceptions). Read more in our document <a shape="rect" href="if_your_landlord_wants_you_to_leave.html">If your landlord wants you to
leave</a>. </p>

<p>As a tenant, you may end the periodic tenancy at any time. You do not have
to give a reason. Again, there are detailed rules about notice periods and what
constitutes a valid notice of termination – see ‘Ending your tenancy’
below</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="lef263">Part 4 tenancy</h2>

<p>If you have been renting for at least 6 months and haven't been served with
a valid written notice of termination, in general you automatically acquire
security of tenure and can stay in the property for a number of years.</p>
<ul><li>If your tenancy started on or before 24 December 2016, this period is 4
    years</li>
  <li>If your tenancy started after 24 December 2016, this period is 6
  years</li>
</ul><p>This security of tenure continues in 6-year (formerly 4-year) cycles.</p>

<p>So, after the first 6 months, your tenancy becomes what is known as a Part 4
tenancy – this refers to <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/section/25/enacted/en/html#part4">Part
4 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004</a>, which deals with security of
tenure. If you have a periodic tenancy, you do not have to claim the Part 4
tenancy in writing, but you do need to claim it if you have a fixed-term lease
– see below.</p>

<h3>Exceptions to general rule</h3>

<p>If you are renting a flat or apartment that was originally part of the
landlord's main house, your landlord can choose to opt out of the Part 4
provisions on security of tenure. Read more in our document on <a href="sharing_accommodation_with_your_landlord.html">Sharing accommodation
with your landlord</a>.</p>

<p>Tenants of certain dwellings let by housing associations (transitional
dwellings) cannot gain the benefit of Part 4 rights. </p>

<h3>Further Part 4 tenancy</h3>

<p>After the first cycle (4 or 6 years) of your Part 4 tenancy has ended, your
Part 4 tenancy ends and a new tenancy begins. You now have a further Part 4
tenancy. Up to 17 January 2017, your landlord could end this tenancy at any
time in the first 6 months without having to give a reason. The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/act/17/schedule/enacted/en/html">Planning
and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016</a> has repealed
this provision with effect from 17 January 2017.</p>

<p>When you have acquired a Part 4 tenancy or further Part 4 tenancy, your
landlord can terminate your tenancy only in certain circumstances. Read more in
our document <a href="if_your_landlord_wants_you_to_leave.html">If your
landlord wants you to leave</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to leave and you do not have a fixed-term agreement, you do not
have to give a reason, but you must give the correct period of notice in
writing as required under the legislation – see ‘Ending your tenancy’
below.</p>

<p><strong>Preventing a further Part 4 tenancy</strong></p>

<p>Ifyour landlord wishes to stop a further Part 4 tenancy coming into
existence, they may serve a notice during the original Part 4 tenancy, with the
notice period expiring on or after the end of the tenancy. A notice served in
this way should provide a reason for termination. The reason does not need to
be one of the valid grounds for terminating a Part 4 tenancy.</p>

<h3>Claiming a Part 4 tenancy at the end of a fixed-term lease </h3>

<p>If you have a fixed-term contract or lease and you wish to remain in the
property under the rights acquired under Part 4, you must notify your landlord
of your intention to stay in the property. You must do this between 3 months
and 1 month before the expiry of your fixed–term tenancy or lease agreement.
You can use this <a href="../../reference/howtos/how_to_notice_of_intent_to_remain_in_rented_dwelling.html">sample
letter of notification to remain in the property under Part 4</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not notify your landlord, you cannot be refused coverage under
Part 4, but you may have to compensate the landlord for any financial loss that
they incur because you did not notify them of your intention to remain in the
tenancy. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1715c">Ending your tenancy</h2>

<p>The following outlines the requirements for a tenant who wishes to end a
tenancy. (As noted above, landlords must also <a href="if_your_landlord_wants_you_to_leave.html">comply with detailed
rules</a> if they wish to end a tenancy.) There is more detail for both tenants
and landlords in this leaflet <a href="http://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prtb.ie%2Fdocs%2Fdefault-source%2Fterminating-a-tenancy%2Fterminating-a-tenancy.doc%3Fsfvrsn%3D6&amp;ei=OBccVfWCB-Xl7gb0sIDICw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGEZsPbeHsfG7JaQV-Hh6mShAG8bQ&amp;sig2=Cldn91G3hC9RmEngf7LP7w">Terminating
a tenancy (doc)</a>, published by the <a href="private_residential_tenancies_board.html">Residential Tenancies Board
(RTB)</a>.</p>

<h3>Format of termination notice</h3>

<p>As a tenant, you can terminate your tenancy (whether fixed-term or periodic)
without giving a reason, but you must provide a valid notice of termination to
your landlord. In order to be valid, this notice must:</p>
<ul><li>Be in writing</li>
  <li>Be signed by you</li>
  <li>Specify the date that you are serving it on the landlord</li>
  <li>Specify the termination date of the tenancy (you have the full 24 hours
    of this date to vacate possession)</li>
  <li>State that any issue as to the validity of the notice may be referred to
    the RTB within 28 days of receipt of the notice</li>
</ul><p>You can use Threshold’s <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/download/doc/sample_notice_of_termination_by_a_tenant.doc">sample
notice of termination (doc)</a>.</p>

<h3>Required notice periods</h3>

<p>You must also give the required period of notice as set out in the table
below. </p>

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>Length of tenancy</strong> </td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>Required period of notice by

      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">16 weeks (112 days)</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><h3>Ending a fixed-term tenancy</h3>

<p>If you have a fixed-term tenancy agreement or a lease, you are also subject
to the terms of this agreement, as well as having to comply with the notice
periods listed above. This means that you may lose your deposit if you leave
before the term stated in the lease, even if you give the correct amount of
notice. However, there are some exceptions, as follows:</p>
<ul><li>If there is a break clause in your lease, you can use it to end the
    tenancy</li>
  <li>If you and the landlord both agree to ending the tenancy sooner</li>
  <li>If the landlord has breached their obligations under the lease, and has
    not rectified the breach within a reasonable time, then you only need to
    give 28 days’ notice</li>
  <li>If the landlord’s behaviour causes imminent danger of death or serious
    injury, or danger to the fabric of the dwelling, then you only need to give
    7 days’ notice</li>
  <li>If a private landlord has refused permission to assign or sublet</li>
</ul><h3>Further information</h3>

<p>If you are living in rented accommodation you are entitled to get a rent
book, unless you are <a href="sharing_accommodation_with_your_landlord.html">renting a room in your
landlordâ€™s home</a>.</p>

<p>A rent book is a document that records details about the tenancy and notes
all rent payments that you make. Usually it is in booklet form, but it can be
in another form, provided it contains all the necessary details.</p>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/si/0146.html">Housing (Rent Books)
Regulations 1993</a>, you are entitled to get a rent book, whether you are
renting from a private landlord, a <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/housing_associations.html">housing
association</a>, a <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/applying_for_local_authority_housing.html">local
authority</a> or an employer. </p>

<p>Your landlord should record all rent payments in the rent book. If you make
the payments in person, the landlord should sign the book or give you a signed
receipt with details of the payment. If you pay in another way, such as by post
or standing order, the landlord should either sign the rent book or give you a
written receipt within 3 months of the payment.</p>

<p>Your rent book should also contain the following information:</p>
<ul><li>The address of the flat or house </li>
  <li>Your landlord's name and address and the landlord's agent (if any) </li>
  <li>Your name </li>
  <li>The date the tenancy started </li>
  <li>The length of the tenancy </li>
  <li>The amount of deposit paid </li>
  <li>The amount of rent and how it is to be paid </li>
  <li>Details of any other payments for services, such as heating or cable
    television </li>
  <li>A statement on the basic rights and duties of landlords and tenants </li>
  <li>A list of furnishings and appliances supplied by the landlord </li>
</ul><p>It is your landlord's responsibility to give you a rent book. They are
widely available and are not expensive. You should keep it in your possession
but you should give it to the landlord when requested, so they can make changes
and record the rent and other payments. </p>

<p>If your landlord refuses to give you a rent book or provide you with
receipts or statements of rent paid, this is against the law. If you wish to
make a complaint, you should contact <a shape="rect" href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">your
local authority</a>, which can issue a notice requiring the landlord to comply
and can initiate legal action if necessary.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The law on residential tenancies requires private landlords and approved
housing bodies (housing associations) to follow certain procedures before
asking a tenant to leave rented accommodation. They must also give the tenant a
minimum amount of notice, depending on how long the tenancy has lasted.</p>

<h3>Residential tenancies legislation</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0027/index.html">Residential
Tenancies Act 2004</a> set out the rights and obligations of landlords and
tenants and introduced detailed rules governing residential tenancies. It
introduced the concept of <em>Part 4 rights</em>, to provide security of tenure
to tenants who are in a tenancy for between 6 months and 4 years. It also
detailed the required notice periods and the form that a notice of termination
must take. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/42/enacted/en/html">Residential
Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015</a> amended the 2004 Act. It increased the
required notice periods for terminating tenancies of 5 years or over – see
‘Notice periods’ below - and brought <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/housing_associations.html">housing
association</a> tenancies under the remit of the Private Residential Tenancies
Board, which is now the <a href="private_residential_tenancies_board.html">Residential Tenancies Board
(RTB)</a>.</p>

<p>The 2015 Act also requires landlords to provide extra documentation when
terminating a tenancy in certain situations - see ‘Notice of termination’
below. </p>

<p>The Law Reform Commission has produced a <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/en_act_2004_0027.htm">consolidated
version of the 2004 Act</a> as of 9 May 2016, incorporating all amendments in
effect on that date.</p>

<h3>Recent changes</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/act/17/schedule/enacted/en/html">Planning
and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016</a> contains
several amendments to the residential tenancies legislation. <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/search-results/news/article/2016/12/23/changes-to-policy-and-the-law">Some
of the changes took effect from 24 December 2016</a>, some took effect from 17
January 2017, and some others will require Commencement Orders. The changes
include:</p>
<ul><li>Measures to prevent the simultaneous serving of termination notices on
    large numbers of residents in a single development</li>
  <li>Extending the period of a <em>Part 4 tenancy</em> from 4 years to 6 years
    - for tenancies created from 24 December 2016</li>
  <li>Removing the provision that allowed a landlord to end a <em>further Part
    4 tenancy</em> during the first 6 months without having to give a
  reason</li>
  <li>Changes to declarations required when a termination is due to sale of the
    dwelling</li>
</ul><p><a href="http://www.rtb.ie/search-results/news/article/2017/01/19/further-changes-to-policy-and-the-law">Read
more about these and other measures on rtb.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>Scope of legislation</h3>

<p>A private residential tenancy means a tenancy that is agreed privately
between a landlord and a tenant. If you are getting <a shape="rect" href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a>, you are probably renting from a private landlord, so you would
be covered by the residential tenancies legislation. It also covers tenancies
under the <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/rental_accommodation_scheme.html">Rental
Accommodation Scheme (RAS)</a> and the <a href="housing_assistance_payment.html">Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)</a>.
Since <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/docs/default-source/legislative-changes/changes-commenced-7th-april-2016.docx?sfvrsn=2">7
April 2016</a>, the legislation also covers housing association tenancies.</p>

<p>If you are renting from a local authority, you are not covered by this
legislation. See <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/notice_to_quit_and_eviction.html">Repossession
of rented social housing</a> for information on procedures that local
authorities must follow if asking their tenants to leave. </p>

<p>If you are renting a <strong>room</strong> that is part of your landlord's
home, your tenancy is not covered by this legislation. However, if you are
renting a <strong>self-contained flat or apartment</strong> in your
landlord’s home, your tenancy is covered. See our document on <a href="sharing_accommodation_with_your_landlord.html">sharing accommodation
with your landlord</a> for more information.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lc0aea">Terminating a tenancy</h2>

<p>How easily your landlord can end your tenancy depends on the type of tenancy
you have and how long you have been in the accommodation. Your landlord must
always give you valid written notice when asking you to leave - see 'Notice of
termination' and 'Notice periods' below. </p>

<p>If you have a fixed-term tenancy, the landlord cannot normally end the
tenancy unless you are in breach of your obligations – read more <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/dispute-resolution/disputes/terminating-a-fixed-term-tenancy">on
the RTB's website</a>.</p>

<p>After the first 6 months you acquire rights to <a href="types_of_tenancy.html">security of tenure</a>, even if you have a
fixed-term tenancy (of 1 year, for example). The provisions on security of
tenure are in <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/section/25/enacted/en/html#part4">Part
4</a> of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and the rights that they give are
generally known as <em>Part 4 rights</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Exceptions</strong></p>

<p>If you are renting a <strong>self-contained flat or apartment in your
landlord’s home, which was originally part of the main house</strong>, your
landlord can choose to opt out of the Part 4 provisions under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/section/25/enacted/en/html#sec25">Section
25</a> of the Act. You must get notice in writing, before the start of the
tenancy, if the landlord wishes to take this option.</p>

<p>Tenants of certain dwellings let by housing associations (transitional
dwellings) cannot gain the benefit of Part 4 rights. </p>
<strong>When you can be asked to leave</strong> 

<p>Tenancies that are governed by Part 4 of the 2004 Act and that started on or
before 24 December 2016 run in 4-year cycles. Tenancies that started after 24
December 2016 run in 6-year cycles. </p>

<p>During the first 6 months of a tenancy, the landlord can ask you to leave
without giving a reason (unless you have a fixed-term tenancy) but must serve a
valid written notice of termination, allowing a minimum 28-day notice period.
Only 7 days’ notice is required in the first 6 months if your behaviour is
seriously anti-social or threatens the fabric of the property. </p>

<h3>Part 4 tenancies</h3>

<p>Your tenancy is known as a <em>Part 4 tenancy</em> in the following
situations:</p>
<ul><li>It started <strong>on or before 24 December 2016</strong> and has lasted
    between 6 months and 4 years, or</li>
  <li>It started <strong>after 24 December 2016</strong> and has lasted between
    6 months and 6 years</li>
</ul><p>After the first cycle (4 or 6 years) of your Part 4 tenancy has ended, you
enter a new cycle – see ‘Further Part 4 tenancies’ below.</p>
<strong>Restriction on terminating when selling multiple properties</strong> 

<p><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/act/17/enacted/en/print#sec40">Section
40 of the 2016 Act</a> provides that a landlord cannot terminate a Part 4
tenancy if he intends to sell 10 or more dwellings in a development within a
6-month period, unless he can show that the market value with a sitting tenant
is over 20% below the market value with vacant possession, and that preventing
him from terminating the tenancy would be unduly onerous on him or would cause
him undue hardship. This provision is often called the ‘Tyrrelstown’
amendment.</p>
<strong>Valid reasons for ending a Part 4 tenancy</strong> 

<p>The landlord can end a Part 4 tenancy only in the following
circumstances:</p>
<ul><li>If you do not comply with the <a href="tenants_rights_and_obligations.html">obligations of the
    tenancy</a> </li>
  <li>If the property is no longer suited to your needs (for example, if it is
    overcrowded) </li>
  <li>If the landlord intends to sell the property within 3 months (however, if
    the landlord plans to sell 10 or more dwellings in a development within a
    6-month period, he must show that the market value with a sitting tenant is
    over 20% below the market value with vacant possession, and that preventing
    him from terminating the tenancy would be unduly onerous on him or would
    cause him undue hardship)</li>
</ul><p>or for the following 3 specific reasons:</p>
<ul><li>If the landlord needs the property for their own use or for an immediate
    family member (this only applies to private landlords)</li>
  <li>If the landlord intends to refurbish the property substantially</li>
  <li>If the landlord plans to change the business use of the property (for
    example, convert it to office use)</li>
</ul><p>See 'Notice of termination' below for more details.</p>

<h3>Further Part 4 tenancies</h3>

<p><strong>If your tenancy started on or before 24 December 2016:</strong> When
the 4-year cycle of the tenancy has ended, a new tenancy starts, known as a
<em>further Part 4 tenancy</em>. This tenancy will now last 6 years.</p>

<p><strong>If your tenancy started after 24 December 2016:</strong> The further
Part 4 tenancy will start when the first 6-year cycle of the original Part 4
tenancy has ended and it will last 6 years.</p>
<strong>Ending a further Part 4 tenancy</strong> 

<p>The legislation originally provided that your landlord could end a further
Part 4 tenancy at any time during the first 6 months without having to give a
reason. This rule has been changed with effect from 17 January 2017 and the
landlord must provide one of the valid reasons listed above.</p>
<strong>Preventing a further Part 4 tenancy</strong> 

<p>If a landlord wishes to stop a further Part 4 tenancy coming into existence,
they may serve a notice during the original Part 4 tenancy, with the notice
period expiring on or after the end of the tenancy. A notice served in this way
should provide a reason for termination, but the reason does not need to be one
of the above grounds.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lab681">Notice of termination</h2>

<p>If your landlord wants you to leave, they must serve you with a valid
written notice of termination. The notice can be posted to you, be given to you
in person or be left for you at your address. Neither email nor text messages
qualify as valid notices of termination. If it appears that you are not living
in the property, the landlord can affix the notice to the outside of the
property. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0027/print.html#sec62">Section
62 of the 2004 Act</a> sets down the requirements for a valid notice of
termination. A notice of termination must:</p>
<ul><li>Be in writing </li>
  <li>Be signed by the landlord (or an authorised agent) </li>
  <li>Specify the date of termination of the tenancy</li>
  <li>State that you have the whole 24 hours of the termination date to vacate
    the property </li>
  <li>Specify the date of the notice itself</li>
  <li>State the reason for termination, if a tenancy has lasted more than 6
    months or is a fixed-term tenancy</li>
  <li>State that any issue as to the validity of the notice or the right of the
    landlord to serve it must be referred to the <acronym title="Private Residential Tenancies Board ">RTB</acronym> within 28 days
    from the receipt of the notice. </li>
</ul><p>In addition, the landlord must provide additional details in certain
situations and, in some cases, a statutory declaration. The RTB provides <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/dispute-resolution/disputes/sample-notices-of-termination">sample
notices of termination</a>, giving the details required in each situation. </p>

<h3>If the property is being sold</h3>

<p>If the landlord intends to <strong>sell the property within 3 months of the
termination of your tenancy</strong>, the notice of termination must state that
“The reason for the termination of the tenancy is due to the fact that the
landlord intends to sell the dwelling, for full consideration, within 3 months
after the termination of the tenancy”. The notice must also include a
statutory declaration stating the landlord’s intention to sell.</p>

<p>If the landlord is availing of the exception to the ‘Tyrrelstown’
amendment (see above) in order to terminate the Part 4 tenancy, the statutory
declaration must also state that that the market value with a sitting tenant is
over 20% below the market value with vacant possession, and that preventing him
from terminating the tenancy would be unduly onerous on him or would cause him
undue hardship.</p>

<p>The RTB’s <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/docs/default-source/notice-of-terminations-landlord-pdf/landlord-intends-to-sell-the-dwelling.pdf?sfvrsn=2">sample
notice of termination due to intention to sell (pdf)</a> contains the required
information and a sample statutory declaration.</p>

<h3>Termination for 3 other specific reasons</h3>

<p>There are particular rules if the landlord gives one of the following 3
reasons in the notice of termination:</p>
<ul><li>They need the property for their own use or for an immediate family
  member</li>
  <li>They plan to refurbish the property substantially and need vacant
    possession</li>
  <li>They intend to change the use of the property</li>
</ul><p>The detailed rules are outlined below. In addition, if any of these 3
reasons is cited, you must also be told that if the dwelling becomes available
for letting within a certain period and you have given the landlord your
contact details, they must offer you a tenancy. (This requirement does not
apply if your tenancy is being ended due to a breach of your obligations,
overcrowding or the property being sold.)</p>

<p><strong>Detailed rules</strong></p>

<p>If the landlord <strong>needs the property for their own use or for an
immediate family member</strong>, you must be given the following information
in writing, along with the notice of termination: the person’s name; their
relationship to the landlord; and how long they will occupy the dwelling. The
notice must also include a statutory declaration stating that the landlord
needs the property for their own use or for an immediate family member. The
RTB’s <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/docs/default-source/notice-of-terminations-landlord-pdf/landlord-requires-dwelling-for-own-or-family-use.pdf?sfvrsn=2">sample
notice of termination when the landlord needs the property (pdf)</a> contains
the required information and a sample statutory declaration.</p>

<p>If the landlord <strong>intends to refurbish the property to the extent that
it needs to be vacant</strong>, they must state the nature of the works in
writing, along with the notice of termination. If planning permission is
required, the notice must be accompanied by a copy of the permission. If
planning permission is not required, the notice must state this and must
provide the name of the contractor (if any); the dates of the intended works;
and their proposed duration – see the RTB’s <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/docs/default-source/notice-of-terminations-landlord-pdf/landlord-intends-to-substantially-refurbish-or-renovate.pdf?sfvrsn=2">sample
notice of termination due to intention to refurbish (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>If the landlord <strong>intends to change the use of the property</strong>
(and has obtained any necessary planning permission) they must state the nature
of the change in writing, along with the notice of termination. The notice must
confirm that any necessary planning permission has been received. The RTB’s
<a href="http://www.rtb.ie/docs/default-source/notice-of-terminations-landlord-pdf/landlord-intends-to-change-the-use-of-the-dwelling-2.pdf?sfvrsn=2">sample
notice of termination due to change of use (pdf)</a> contains the required
information.</p>

<h3>Redress</h3>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/section/56/enacted/en/html#sec56">section
56 of the 2004 Act</a>, you can complain to the RTB in the following
situations:</p>
<ul><li>If your landlord has ended your tenancy for one of the 3 reasons
    specified above, the property becomes available for re-letting and they do
    not offer you a tenancy</li>
  <li>If they did not carry out the intention stated in the notice of
    termination – either one of the above 3 reasons or sale of the
  property</li>
</ul><p>If the RTB upholds your complaint, it may direct the landlord to pay you
damages or to reinstate your tenancy, or both.</p>

<h3>Sample notices for termination in other situations</h3>

<p>The RTB’s sample notices cover several other situations, for instance if
the landlord is terminating your tenancy due to rent arrears. In this case you
must have received a written warning notice at least 14 days before the notice
of termination is issued – see ‘Notice periods’ below. The RTB’s <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/docs/default-source/notice-of-terminations-landlord-pdf/rent-arrears-not.pdf?sfvrsn=2">sample
(pdf)</a> contains both of these notices.</p>

<p>Sample notices of termination are also available for <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/docs/default-source/notice-of-terminations-landlord-pdf/breach-of-tenant-obligations-2.pdf?sfvrsn=2">breach
of tenant obligations (pdf)</a> and <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/docs/default-source/notice-of-terminations-landlord-pdf/notice-of-termination-for-anti-social-behaviour.pdf?sfvrsn=2">anti-social
behaviour (pdf)</a>. There is also a sample notice for when the dwelling is <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/docs/default-source/notice-of-terminations-landlord-pdf/dwelling-is-no-longer-suitable-to-the-accommodation-needs-of-the-tenant-2.pdf?sfvrsn=2">no
longer suited to your household’s needs (pdf)</a>. In this case, the notice
must be accompanied by a signed and dated statement of the number of bed spaces
in the property and the reasons why it is no longer suitable, having regard to
the bed spaces and the size and composition of your household.</p>

<h3>Slips or omissions</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/42/enacted/en/print#sec30">Section
30</a> of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 deals with slips or
omissions that are contained in the notice or that occurred during its service.
This section provides that, when dealing with a <a href="disputes_between_landlords_and_tenants.html">dispute</a> in respect of
a notice of termination, an adjudicator (or the Tenancy Tribunal) may make a
determination that such a slip or omission shall not of itself render the
notice of termination invalid, if the adjudicator or Tribunal is satisfied
that:</p>
<ul><li>The slip or omission concerned does not prejudice, in a material respect,
    the notice of termination, and</li>
  <li>The notice of termination is otherwise in compliance with the provisions
    of the Act</li>
</ul><p>Read more on the websites of the <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/media-research/news-centre/latest-news/2015/12/04/new-amendments-to-the-legislation-on-rent-increases-and-notices-of-termination-effective-from-4th-december-2015">Residential

    </tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Exceptions to required notice periods</strong></p>

<p>If you are not keeping your obligations, your landlord only needs to give
you 28 days’ notice, regardless of the length of your tenancy. However, if
your behaviour is seriously anti-social or threatens the fabric of the
property, the landlord only needs to give you 7 days’ notice. <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/section/17/enacted/en/html#sec17">Section
17 (1) (a) and (b) of the 2004 Act</a> sets out the type of seriously
anti-social behaviour for which a 7-day notice may be allowed. </p>

<p>If your rent is in arrears, your landlord must first give you written
notification of the amount owing and must give you 14 days to pay the arrears.
If you still have not paid 14 days after you got this notification, your
landlord can then give you 28 days’ notice of termination.</p>

<p>Landlords and tenants can agree shorter notice periods than the minimum
periods set out above, but they can only do so at the time they decide to
terminate the tenancy. It is illegal to agree a shorter notice period at the
start of the tenancy. </p>

<p>Landlords and tenants can also agree longer notice periods, but the maximum
is 70 days when the tenancy has lasted less than 6 months.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l71b51">Illegal eviction</h2>

<p>If your landlord locks you out or physically evicts you, you may be able to
apply for an injunction to force them to let you back into the property or you
may apply to the <acronym title="Private Residential Tenancies Board ">RTB</acronym> to do so on your
behalf. Similarly if your landlord cuts off water, gas or electricity, you may
be able to take legal action to restore the supply. In either case, you should
get legal advice and assistance before you proceed. Your landlord cannot remove
your possessions from your home while your tenancy is still in existence
(though after a tenancy has ended, a landlord is under no legal obligation to
store or maintain belongings). </p>

<p>If your landlord is going to refer a dispute to the RTB, you should get
advice about your situation from Threshold or a solicitor. The <a href="http://www.flac.ie/">Free Legal Advice Centres (FLAC)</a> operates a
network of legal advice clinics throughout the State. These clinics are
confidential, free of charge and open to all. Contact your nearest <a href="http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/">Citizens Information Centre</a>

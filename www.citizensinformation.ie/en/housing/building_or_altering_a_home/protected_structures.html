<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>A protected structure is a structure that a planning authority considers to
be of special interest from an architectural, historical, archaeological,
artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical point of view. If you are
the owner or occupier of a protected structure, you are legally obliged to
prevent it becoming endangered, whether through damage or neglect. This
document describes the protection given to these structures under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0030/sec0051.html#partiv">Part
IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000</a>.</p>

<p>A structure must be listed on the planning authority’s Record of Protected
Structures (RPS) to qualify for protected status under the Act. Each planning
authority is obliged to keep a RPS as part of its <a shape="rect" href="../planning_permission/planning_devel_plans.html">development plan</a>.
The RPS must include every structure in the planning authority's area which it
considers to be of special interest. Inclusion of these structures in the RPS
means that their importance is recognised, they are legally protected from harm
and all future changes to the structure are controlled and managed through the
development control process (for example, planning permission) or by issuing a
declaration under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0030/sec0057.html">Section
57 of the Planning and Development Act 2000</a>. </p>

<p>If a structure is included in the RPS, the protection extends to the
interior of the structure; to the land in its curtilage; and to any other
structures on that land and their interiors. <em>Curtilage</em> means the land
and outbuildings immediately surrounding a structure which is (or was) used for
the purposes of the structure. This obligation also applies to all fixtures and
features forming part of the interior and exterior of the protected structure
or any structure on the grounds attached to it. If there is an urgent need for
repairs to a protected structure, a grant may be available under the <a href="http://www.ahg.gov.ie/app/uploads/2015/09/srf_2015_circular_february-2015.pdf">Structures
at Risk Fund (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>The planning authority can add and delete structures from its RPS when
reviewing its development plan or at any other time. Three stages must be gone
through before a structure can be added to the RPS:</p>
<ul><li>Identification </li>
  <li>Assessment </li>
  <li>Notification </li>
</ul><h3>Identification of protected structures</h3>

<p>A planning authority can use a number of different sources to help it to
identify structures for protection. These include:</p>
<ul><li>A planning authority can carry out a survey of its area to determine if
    there are structures that should be added to the RPS. </li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/">National Inventory of
    Architectural Heritage (NIAH)</a> compiles records of Ireland's
    architectural heritage. It provides planning authorities with details of
    surveys of their area. NIAH surveys may be used by the Minister for Arts,
    Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to make recommendations on
    structures to be added to the RPS. It is up to the planning authority to
    decide if any of the structures recommended should be included in the RPS.
  </li>
  <li>The Minister can also make recommendations to a planning authority to
    include individual structures in the RPS. </li>
  <li>Anyone can write to a planning authority to recommend a structure for
    protection, but the decision to include it in the RPS can only be made by
    the elected members of the planning authority. </li>
</ul><h3>Assessment of protected structures</h3>

<p>A planning authority decides whether a structure should be included in the
Record of Protected Structures (RPS) by identifying characteristics of special
interest under the following headings: architectural, historical,
archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, technical, and social. The
assessment process should be impartial and objective.</p>

<h3>Notification of addition to the Record of Protected Structures<br></h3>

<p>If the planning authority decides to consider a structure for inclusion in
the RPS, it must go through the process laid down in the 2000 Act. It must
notify the owner and occupier that the structure is a ‘proposed protected
structure’. This means the structure has the same protection as a structure
already on the RPS pending the final decision of the planning authority. </p>

<p>The planning authority must also inform the Minister of the proposed
addition, along with a number of bodies prescribed by the <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Legislation/DevelopmentandHousing/Planning/FileDownLoad,32878,en.pdf">Planning
and Development Regulations (pdf)</a>, including the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.heritagecouncil.ie/">Heritage Council</a>, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.artscouncil.ie/">Arts Council</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.failteireland.ie/">Fáilte Ireland</a> and <a shape="rect" href="http://www.antaisce.org/">An Taisce</a>. Details of proposed additions to
the RPS must be displayed in public for at least 6 weeks (10 weeks if it is
done during the making of a development plan), during which time anyone,
including the owner or occupier of the structure, has the right to comment on
the proposal to the planning authority. These comments will be taken into
account before the authority’s elected members decide whether or not the
structure should become a protected structure. </p>

<p>The decision to list the structure in the RPS must be made within 12 weeks
of the end of the display period. The planning authority must notify the owner
and occupier of the structure of their decision within 2 weeks.</p>

<p>If a structure is to be deleted from the list, the same process must be
followed. Details of the structure proposed for deletion must be displayed in
public and any comments or objections from the public or the owner/occupier
must be taken into account by the elected members of the planning authority
when making their decision. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="le4fd2">Obligations on owners and occupiers of
protected structures</h2>

<p>Owners or occupiers of protected structures are legally required to make
sure that the structure does not become endangered through neglect, decay,
damage or harm. Generally, if a structure is kept in habitable condition and
regular maintenance is carried out (such as cleaning out gutters, repairing
missing slates, repainting external timberwork) it should not become
endangered. </p>

<p>If a protected structure is endangered, the planning authority can serve a
notice on the owner or occupier, requiring them to carry out any work that it
considers necessary to protect the structure. The work must be done within 8
weeks of the date of the notice. The planning authority can also service a
notice to require the ‘restoration of character’ of the protected
structure. This could include removing, changing or replacing any parts of the
structure specified in the notice.</p>

<p>Owners or occupiers can make written representations to the planning
authority about the terms of the notice. They may request more time or
financial help to comply with the notice. In many cases, they may be eligible
for a conservation grant. The planning authority will take these
representations into account when making their final decision. Owners and
occupiers can appeal against the notice to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a> within 2
weeks of their last response from the planning authority, if they are still not
satisfied.</p>

<p>If a notice to prevent a structure from becoming endangered has been
ignored, the planning authority can take enforcement action. in the case of
endangerment or restoration of character notices, the planning authority can
carry out the work itself and recover the costs of the work from the owner or
the occupier. In exceptional cases, the planning authority may buy the
protected structure from the owner, either by <a shape="rect" href="../losing_your_home/compulsory_purchase_and_compensation.html">compulsory
purchase</a> or by agreement. This would only be done if the planning authority
considered it the only way to save a protected structure.</p>

<p>Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, there are penalties for owners
or occupiers of protected structures who endanger the structure or who fail to
carry out work that has been ordered by the planning authority. If they are
found guilty, they could be liable for fines of up to €12.7 million and/or a
term of imprisonment of up to 2 years.</p>

<h3>Planning permission</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../planning_permission/planning_permission_general.html">Planning
permission</a> is needed for work carried out on a protected structure that
would materially affect its character. This means that many types of work,
which in another building would be considered exempted development, may not be
exempted where the building is a protected structure. Depending on the nature
of the structure and the features of interest even work such as painting the
interior or replacing windows could affect its character and require planning
permission.</p>

<p>If you are unsure about what works require planning permission for your
particular building you can apply in writing to your planning authority for a
declaration under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0030/sec0057.html">Section
57 of the Planning and Development Act 2000</a> about the structure and its
curtilage (or grounds attached). This declaration states what types of work can
be carried out without affecting the character of the structure. A declaration
cannot exempt any works which would otherwise require planning permission. A
planning authority will issue this declaration within 12 weeks of receiving a
request. There is no fee for this service. You can take a case to <a shape="rect" href="../planning_permission/an_bord_pleanala.html">An Bord
Pleanála</a> if you disagree with the declaration issued to you.</p>

<p>You must apply for planning permission in the usual way if more extensive
work is planned. However, you will need to include more detail, such as
drawings, photographs or any other material necessary to explain how the
proposed alterations would affect the character of the structure. The newspaper
and site notices for the planning application must state that the structure is
a protected structure. You should check with your planning authority to find
out what additional information they require when applying for planning
permission on a protected structure. If the planning authority has refused
planning permission, <a shape="rect" href="../planning_permission/appealing_planning_permission_decision.html">you
can appeal this decision to An Bord Pleanála</a>.</p>

<p>The Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has
a number of useful publications in this area. </p>

<p>They include: </p>
<ul><li>A series of practical advice leaflets on topics such as <a href="http://www.ahg.gov.ie/app/uploads/2015/07/Energy-Efficiency-in-Traditional-Buildings-2010.pdf">energy
    efficiency in traditional buildings (pdf)</a> and <a href="http://www.ahg.gov.ie/app/uploads/2015/07/Windows-A-Guide-to-the-Repair-of-Historic-Windows-2007.pdf">repairing
    historic windows (pdf)</a> </li>
  <li>A series of guidelines on <em>Architectural Heritage Protection</em>.
    These are statutory guidelines to which planning authorities must have
    regard in their work but they will also be of assistance to owners of
    protected structures, their advisers and everyone with an interest in
    architectural heritage.</li>
  <li>A series of detailed conservation guidelines to help architects, builders
    and owners to understand the guiding principles of conservation and
    restoration.</li>
</ul><p>Copies of these publications can be purchased from the Government
Publications Sales Office or downloaded free <a href="http://www.ahg.gov.ie/heritage/heritage-publications/?month=0&amp;years=0&amp;topics=44&amp;paged=1">from

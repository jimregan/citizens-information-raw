<p>Adapting your home may become necessary as you grow older. You may also need
to adapt your home if you or a family member has a disability. </p>

<p>Common alterations to make a home suitable for someone with a disability or
limited mobility include:</p>
<ul><li>Widening doorways and passageways</li>
</ul><ul><li>Moving light switches, door handles, doorbells and entry phones to
    convenient heights</li>
</ul><ul><li>Installing grab rails for support</li>
</ul><ul><li>Adapting bathroom facilities (for example, raised toilet, back rest
    against the toilet cistern, level deck shower, bath with hoist, handbasin
    at appropriate height)</li>
</ul><ul><li>Locating bathroom or bedroom facilities at ground-floor level</li>
</ul><ul><li>Installing ramps to avoid using steps</li>
</ul><ul><li>Ensuring that external approaches such as paths or drives have a firm,
    level surface</li>
</ul><ul><li>Installing a stair lift or elevator</li>
</ul><ul><li>Specialised furniture, like adjustable beds or support chairs</li>
</ul><ul><li>Setting up alert devices for someone who is deaf or hard of hearing</li>
</ul><p>In case of fire or other emergency, it is important that exits should always
be accessible and that you do not rely entirely on mechanical means (such as a
lift) to get out.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lbfbde">Planning to adapt your home</h2>

<p>Before making changes to your home you can consult an <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/care_in_your_community/occupational_therapy_services.html">occupational
therapist</a> (OT) who will assess your daily living needs and advise on
adaptations to your home. You can contact an OT through the <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/care_in_your_community/community_care_services.html">community
care</a> section of <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">your Local Health Office</a>.
Alternatively, you may wish to hire an OT privately, as there may be a waiting
list for the public OT service. The <a href="http://www.aoti.ie/">Association
of Occupational Therapists of Ireland</a> (AOTI) publishes a <a href="http://www.aoti.ie/page.aspx?contentid=57">database of OTs in private
practice</a>, and if you get a grant for the adaptations you may be able to get
back some of the costs of hiring the OT.</p>

<p>Other health professionals, such as <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/care_in_your_community/public_health_nurses.html">public health
nurses</a> and <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/care_in_your_community/physiotherapy_services.html">physiotherapists</a>,
can also advise you on specialised equipment and home adaptations, based on
both your short-term and long-term needs.</p>

<p>If you need to add a structure or an extra room, you may need <a shape="rect" href="../planning_permission/planning_perm_altering_a_house.html">planning

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l1d9ef">Financial help</h2>

<p>Adapting your home may be expensive, particularly if structural change is
involved. There are several ways to reduce the financial burden: </p>
<ul><li>You may be eligible for a means-tested Housing Adaptation Grant for
    People with a Disability. The maximum grant is €30,000. Read more in <a shape="rect" href="../grants_and_schemes_adaptation_grant_for_people_with_disability.html">our
    document on the Housing Adaptation Grant</a>. </li>
  <li>For more basic and cheaper alterations, such as grab rails, level access
    showers or chair-lifts, the Mobility Aids Grant Scheme (also means-tested)
    provides a maximum grant of €6,000. Read more in <a shape="rect" href="../grants_and_schemes/mobility_aids_grant_scheme.html">our document
    on the Mobility Aids Grant Scheme</a> </li>
  <li><p>The <a shape="rect" href="../grants_and_schemes_aid_for_older_persons_scheme.html">Housing Aid
    for Older Persons Scheme</a> is used to improve the condition of an older
    person's home. The type of work covered includes structural repairs,
    re-wiring and upgrades to heating systems. Local authorities vary as
    regards what type of work they will grant aid. For information on what is
    covered in your area, contact your local authority. </p>
  </li>
  <li>You may qualify for a <a shape="rect" href="../grants_and_schemes/local_authority_home_improvement_loans.html">local
    authority home improvement loan</a> to improve, repair or extend your home.
  </li>
  <li>If you have a <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical
    card</a> or a <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/health_related_benefits_and_entitlements/long_term_illness_scheme.html">long
    term illness card</a>, you may be entitled to get essential items of
    equipment free of charge. First, you must be assessed by a relevant
    professional, such as an occupational therapist or a physiotherapist.</li>
  <li>If you are paying for equipment needed for someone with a disability, you
    may be able to claim a <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/vat_refunds_on_aids_and_appliances_used_by_people_with_disabilities.html">VAT
    refund.</a></li>
  <li>You may be eligible for a tax credit under the <a href="../housing_grants_and_schemes/home_renovation_incentive.html">Home
    Renovation Incentive</a> for money spent on adapting your home</li>
  <li>Depending on the work being done, you may be eligible for the <a href="../housing_grants_and_schemes/warmer_homes_scheme.html">Better
    Energy Warmer Homes Scheme</a> or the <a href="../housing_grants_and_schemes/home_energy_saving_scheme.html">Better
    Energy Homes Scheme</a></li>
</ul><p>In general, you should check out your eligibility for the above schemes and
ensure that you comply with their terms. Most of them require you to get
advance approval before starting any works.</p>

<p>You should also check how the various schemes interact – for example, if
you are claiming a grant for the works, the total amount you can claim under
the Home Renovation Incentive will be reduced - see <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/hri/hri-general-faqs.html">Revenue’s
FAQs</a> for more details.</p>

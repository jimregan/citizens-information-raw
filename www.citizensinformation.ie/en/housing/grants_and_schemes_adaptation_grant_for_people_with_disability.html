<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>A housing adaptation grant is available where changes need to be made to a
home to make it suitable for a person with a physical, sensory or intellectual
disability or mental health difficulty to live in. </p>

<p>The grant can help you to make changes and adaptations to your home, for
example, making it wheelchair-accessible, extending it to create more space,
adding a ground-floor bathroom or toilet or a stair-lift. In some cases, the
provision of heating can be included, but only under certain conditions. </p>

<p>If you only require minor work, you can apply for the means-tested <a shape="rect" href="mobility_aids_grant_scheme.html">Mobility Aids Grant
Scheme</a> instead. </p>

<p>These 2 schemes (and the <a href="housing_aid_for_older_persons_scheme.html">Housing Aid for Older
People Scheme</a>) are administered by local authorities, under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/si/0670.html">Housing (Adaptation
Grants for Older People and People with a Disability) Regulations 2007</a>,
which were amended by <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/si/104/made/en/print">new
Regulations</a> in 2014.</p>

<p><a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/vat_refunds_on_aids_and_appliances_used_by_people_with_disabilities.html">VAT
refunds are available on aids and appliances</a> used by people with
disabilities. This refund scheme also applies to the cost of installation and
adaptation work. Several other grants and schemes are outlined in ‘Other
financial supports’ below.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability can be paid to
people in:</p>
<ul><li>Owner-occupied housing </li>
  <li>Houses being purchased from a local authority under the <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/buying_your_local_authority_house.html">Tenant
    Purchase Scheme</a> </li>
  <li>Private rented accommodation (the duration of your tenancy can affect
    grant approval) </li>
  <li>Accommodation provided under the voluntary housing Capital Assistance and
    Rental Subsidy schemes </li>
  <li>Accommodation occupied by people living in communal residences</li>
</ul><p>If you purchase or build a new home, you may get the grant but at a lower
rate – see ‘Rates’ below.</p>

<p>You must satisfy the local authority that you will occupy the property as
your normal place of residence when the works have been done. If you are a
tenant, you must also get written approval from your landlord.</p>

<p><strong>Your application will be prioritised based on medical need. There
are 3 priority levels:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Priority 1</strong>: A person who is terminally ill or fully or
    mainly dependent on their family or carer; or where alterations or
    adaptations would facilitate their discharge from hospital or alleviate the
    need for hospitalisation in the future </li>
  <li><strong>Priority 2</strong>: A person who is mobile but who needs
    assistance in accessing washing, toilet facilities, bedroom etc.; or where
    without the alterations or adaptations their ability to function
    independently would be hindered</li>
  <li><strong>Priority 3</strong>: A person who is independent but who requires
    special facilities to improve their quality of life, for example, a
    separate bedroom or living space </li>
</ul><h3>Assessment by occupational therapist</h3>

<p>An occupational therapist's (OT) assessment may be required. The local
authority can arrange for this, or you can employ an OT yourself and recoup up
to €200 of the cost from the local authority as part of the grant, subject to
the maximum grant limit.</p>

<p>If you are applying for the grant to adapt your home for a child with a
disability, and the child has had an <a href="../../health/health_services_for_people_with_disabilities/assessment_of_need_for_people_with_disabilites.html">assessment
of need</a> under Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, the local authority should
refer to the OT recommendations contained in this assessment report. </p>

<h3>Means test</h3>

<p>Your total household income is assessed to find out if you qualify for the
grant and the amount payable.</p>

<p>Household income is:</p>
<ul><li>The property owner's (or tenant's) annual gross income, together with
    their spouse's or partner's annual gross income, in the previous tax year
  </li>
  <li>The income of any other adults living in the household who are aged over
    23 years if in full-time education, or aged over 18 and not in full-time
    education </li>
</ul><p>The following is not taken into account when calculating your household
income:</p>
<ul><li>€5,000 for each member of the household aged up to 18 years </li>
  <li>€5,000 for each member of the household aged between 18 and 23 years
    and in full-time education or on a <a href="../../education/vocational_education_and_training/apprenticeships.html">SOLAS
    apprenticeship</a> </li>
  <li>€5,000 where the person to whom the grant application relates is being
    cared for by a relative on a full-time basis </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child
    Benefit</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family

  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/domiciliary_care_allowance.html">Domiciliary
    Care Allowance</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/carers/respite_care_grant.html">Respite
    Care Grant</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/carers/carers_benefit.html">Carer's
    Benefit</a> and <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/carers/carers_allowance.html">Carer's
    Allowance</a> (if the carer's payment is made in respect of the person to
    whom the grant application relates) </li>
</ul><h3>Tax information required: applicant</h3>

<p>When applying for the grant, you must provide:</p>
<ul><li>Your tax reference number</li>
  <li>Details of your tax district and</li>
  <li>A statement that, to the best of your knowledge, your tax affairs are in
    order</li>
</ul><p>If the value of your grant application adds up to €10,000 or more, you
must make a valid Tax Clearance Certificate available to the local authority.
You can either provide the physical certificate or else give the local
authority your customer number and the reference number of the certificate and
authorise it to confirm your tax clearance status electronically.</p>

<p>You must also provide evidence of ownership of the property and evidence
that the <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/housing_taxes_and_reliefs/local_property_tax.html">Local
Property Tax</a> on it has been paid.</p>

<h3>Tax information required: contractor</h3>

<p>For payments over €650, you must provide the local authority with the
following details in respect of each contractor:</p>
<ul><li>Name, address, tax reference number and tax district</li>
  <li>C2/tax clearance number and</li>
  <li>Expiry date of the C2/Tax Clearance Certificate</li>
</ul><p>For all grant payments totalling €10,000 and over, contractors must either
produce a valid C2/Tax Clearance Certificate or authorise the local authority
to confirm their tax clearance status electronically.</p>

<p>For payments under €10,000, contractors are not normally required to
provide this information, but the local authority does check contractor details
with Revenue in a certain percentage of cases.</p>

<h3>Quotations for works</h3>

<p>The local authority will only pay grants on the basis of quotations that it
considers reasonable. In general, you must include 2 written itemised
quotations from contractors, indicating the cost of the work required. If you
cannot get a second quotation, or in cases of hardship, the local authority may
accept a single quotation.</p>

<p>It is recommended that the proposed works should include the installation of
smoke and carbon monoxide alarms, if they are not already present and operating
in your home.</p>

<h3>Starting the work to adapt your home</h3>

<p>The grant will <strong>not be paid</strong> if you start work before you get
grant approval. However, it is expected that the work will start within 6
months of your grant approval. If this does not happen, the local authority may
allow a time extension.</p>

<h3>Getting the work done safely</h3>

<p>Under the Regulations governing safety, health and welfare at work,
homeowners are obliged to ensure that construction work on their home is
carried out by competent people. Read more, including a <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Publications_and_Forms/Publications/Construction/homeowners_guidance.pdf">guide
for homeowners (pdf)</a> and some <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Your_Industry/Construction/Construction_FAQ's/Homeowners_FAQs.html">Frequently
Asked Questions</a>, on the website of the <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/">Health and Safety Authority</a>.</p>

<h3>Applying for a further grant</h3>

<p>In general, the work done on your home is expected to be appropriate to your
future needs as well as your current needs. However, if your needs change
substantially over time, you may find that further works are required. You can
apply again for a Housing Adaptation Grant and your application will be
assessed in the normal way. There is no minimum time limit between the payment
of a first and second grant.</p>

<h3>Other financial supports</h3>

<p>As noted above, <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/vat_refunds_on_aids_and_appliances_used_by_people_with_disabilities.html">VAT
refunds are available on the cost of aids and appliances</a> used by people
with disabilities, as well as on the cost of installation and adaptation
work.</p>

<p>You may also qualify for a partial tax credit under the <a href="home_renovation_incentive.html">Home Renovation Incentive</a>.</p>

<p>If you plan to improve the energy efficiency of your home, you may qualify
for the <a href="home_energy_saving_scheme.html">Better Energy Homes
Scheme</a> or the <a href="warmer_homes_scheme.html">Better Energy Warmer
Homes Scheme</a>.</p>

<p>Check the details of these schemes to see how they can be combined.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>If your household income is less than €30,000 you may qualify for 95% of
the cost of the works (up to the maximum grant amount of €30,000). The
proportion of the costs to be grant aided will be tapered from 95% down to 30%,
depending on your income. If your house is <span>less than 12 months old</span>
the grant will generally not exceed €14,500.</p>

<p>Note: The maximum amounts may not be fully awarded. Grant amounts are
subject to the funding of each local authority, so the local authority can
decide whether they pay the full grant or a percentage in each case.</p>

<p>If you are unable to get a loan from a bank or building society to pay for
the costs not covered by the grant, you may be able to get a <a shape="rect" href="local_authority_home_improvement_loans.html">local authority home
improvement loan</a>. </p>

<p>If you are a local authority tenant, the local authority will meet the
entire cost of the works.</p>

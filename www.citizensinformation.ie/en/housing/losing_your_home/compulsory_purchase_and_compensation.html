<p>Certain statutory bodies can take land or property without the consent of
the owner by means of a compulsory purchase order (CPO). Compulsory purchase
usually takes place to allow a public infrastructure project to go ahead for
the common good. CPOs are most often used for road improvement schemes and
urban development schemes, such as the <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/public_transport/luas.html">LUAS</a> project in
Dublin.</p>

<p>The compulsory purchase system is an extremely complex area. You should get
the professional advice of a chartered surveyor as soon as you are served with
a notice relating to a compulsory purchase order (CPO). The fees charged by a
chartered surveyor are part of a normal claim for compensation.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that you have the right to object, make
representations, negotiate, refer to property arbitrators and have your
objections heard. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l7e93e">Compensation</h2>

<p>If your house and land are compulsorily purchased, you will be eligible for
compensation to restore you as far as possible to the same position as you were
in before the land and property were acquired. </p>
<ul><li>You should be paid compensation based on the market value of your
  property</li>
  <li>You should be left in the same financial position after the CPO as you
    were before the process</li>
  <li>The compensation should reflect both the actual land acquired and the
    reduction in value, if any, of the retained area as a result of the CPO</li>
</ul><p>The Society of Chartered Surveyors has published a <a href="https://www.scsi.ie/documents/get_lob?id=402&amp;field=file">client
guide</a> on CPOs and compensation.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lfae71">Derelict or dangerous property</h2>

<p>Each local authority has responsibility for dealing with <a href="../../environment/planning_and_development_in_ireland/copy_of_derelict_sites_and_dangerous_structures.html">derelict
sites</a>, <a href="../../environment/planning_and_development_in_ireland/dangerous_structures.html">dangerous
places and dangerous structures</a> in its area.</p>

<p>A local authority can buy dangerous land in its area (including land that is
no longer dangerous because the local authority has carried out work on it),
either by agreement with the owner or by compulsory purchase. The same applies
to derelict sites.</p>

<p>The local authority must advertise the details of any proposed compulsory
purchase in the local newspaper and send a notice to the owner or occupier of
the land, giving information about how and where to object to the proposed
purchase.</p>

<p>In the case of a dangerous place, a notice must be posted either on or near
the land, giving details of the local authority's intentions.</p>

<p>If an objection is made, the local authority cannot buy the land without the
consent of <a href="../planning_permission/an_bord_pleanala.html">An Bord
Pleanála</a>. If An Bord Pleanála approves the compulsory purchase and the
local authority has dealt with any objections received, the local authority can
buy the land, using a vesting order.</p>

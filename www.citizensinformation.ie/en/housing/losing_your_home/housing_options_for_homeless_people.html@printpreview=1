<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>This document outlines the various types of support and accommodation
options available to <a href="homelessness.html">people who are homeless</a>
– ranging from street-based assistance to long-term housing, as well as
social welfare entitlements. Some people who are homeless simply need somewhere
to live. Others may have specific additional needs, due to mental health
difficulties, addiction, relationship breakdown or other problems. There are
particular arrangements for <a href="youth_homelessness.html">young people
who are homeless</a>.</p>

<p>Depending on your location and your circumstances, different support
services may be available. Most homeless people are in the cities. In Dublin
and Cork, the local authorities and the Department of Social Protection provide
dedicated services for homeless people. Our document on <a href="agencies_for_homeless_people.html">agencies that provide services for
homeless people</a> gives details of where to apply for the various supports.
You will also find useful information in Focus Ireland’s guidebook: <a href="https://www.focusireland.ie/our-services/hub/guidebook">Working to end
homelessness</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Action Plan:</strong> The <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/DevelopmentHousing/Housing/News/MainBody,39778,en.htm">Action
Plan</a> to tackle emergency and short-term homelessness was announced in
December 2014, including:</p>
<ul><li>Enhanced services for rough sleepers, priority allocation of social
    housing and rollout of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) for eligible
    homeless households – all in Dublin</li>
  <li>Extending the <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/housing-supports/dublin.html">Tenancy
    Protection Service</a> to Cork</li>
  <li>Assessing the scale of homelessness in Cork, Limerick, Galway and
    Waterford and identifying actions needed</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lfd1dc">Services for rough sleepers</h2>

<p>Some community services offer contact and food to rough sleepers, that is,
people who are living and sleeping outdoors by day and night. For example, soup
runs provide sandwiches and hot drinks to rough sleepers in many urban
areas.</p>

<p>Street outreach teams befriend and engage with rough sleepers, aiming to
link them with accommodation and other services with a view to helping them off
the streets and into long-term accommodation, at their own pace.</p>

<p>Some organisations provide medical and related services, including bathing
and laundry facilities.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.homelessdublin.ie/responding-rough-sleeping-during-cold-weather-%E2%80%93-cold-weather-initiative-cwi">Cold
Weather Initiative</a> in Dublin provides additional emergency beds from
November to March each year for people who are sleeping rough. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.homelessdublin.ie/new-housing-first-service-combining-street-outreach-and-housing-first">Housing
First Service</a> in the Dublin region provides street outreach to people who
are sleeping rough and helps them to access emergency accommodation. It also
works to secure longer-term accommodation with extensive supports. It builds on
the service formerly offered by the <a href="http://www.homelessdublin.ie/sites/default/files/publications/HFirst_Evaluation2015.pdf">Housing
First Demonstration Project (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>Under the Action Plan of December 2014, additional emergency beds are being
provided in Dublin, as well as a <a href="http://www.homelessdublin.ie/new-night-caf%C3%A9-persons-who-are-rough-sleeping-dublin-opens">Night
Café</a> with food, rest area and showers; transport to emergency
accommodation; and health and care supports.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l4cf81">Accommodation and housing supports</h2>

<h3>Emergency and temporary accommodation</h3>

<p>Hostels are the main form of emergency accommodation provided for single
homeless people. Private emergency accommodation (such as bed and breakfasts or
hotels) is used for people for whom hostel accommodation is not suitable, due
to the size or composition of the household or to particular medical or social
needs. All placements in such accommodation are made on the basis that:</p>
<ul><li>The person or household has been assessed as homeless</li>
  <li>The accommodation is provided as an emergency (short-term) response and
    is subject to ongoing review</li>
  <li>There should be active engagement with homeless services with a view to
    addressing all relevant issues</li>
  <li>All viable options for moving on are explored</li>
  <li>The person or household complies with any house rules and other
    conditions of the accommodation</li>
</ul><p>Hostels can be short-term and/or long-term. Some provide dormitories and/or
single rooms and some include meals and other services. Some may charge for
accommodation on a nightly or weekly basis.</p>

<p>Women and children who are experiencing domestic violence may be
accommodated in dedicated refuges.</p>

<h3>Social housing</h3>

<p>Housing provided by local authorities or voluntary bodies is usually
referred to as <em>social housing</em>. </p>

<p>Local authorities have general responsibility under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1988/en/act/pub/0028/index.html">the
Housing Act 1988</a> for the provision of housing for adults who cannot afford
to provide it for themselves. However, they do not have a statutory obligation
to house people. They may help with accommodation by providing housing directly
or through arrangements with voluntary housing organisations and other
voluntary bodies. They may also provide funding to voluntary bodies for
emergency accommodation and for long-term housing for homeless people. </p>

<p>When you apply for social housing, the local authority must take the fact
that you are homeless into account when assessing your need for housing and
classifying your specific accommodation requirements. As part of the Action
Plan of December 2014, the 4 Dublin housing authorities were directed to
allocate 50% of all housing allocations to homeless households and other
vulnerable groups for the next 6 months, having regard to the length of time
these households have spent on the homeless list and other housing lists. </p>

<p>If the local authority is unable to offer you housing from its own stock, it
may refer you to a housing association or to one of the other services
described below.</p>

<p>To <a href="../local_authority_and_social_housing/applying_for_local_authority_housing.html">apply
for local authority/social housing</a>, you will need to fill in an application
form. Each local authority publishes its own version but the information needed
is standardised. You can get help (if necessary) to fill in this form from the
housing section of your local authority, a <a href="http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/">Citizens Information Centre</a>
or <a href="agencies_for_homeless_people.html">voluntary
organisation</a>.</p>

<p>You will need:</p>
<ul><li>Proof of your current address (homeless accommodation) such as a receipt
    from a hostel or bed and breakfast</li>
  <li>Photo ID such as passport, driving licence</li>
  <li>Your birth certificate</li>
  <li>Your <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">PPS
    Number</a> </li>
  <li>Evidence of your income</li>
  <li>Proof of your citizenship or your <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad,29412,en.pdf">permission
    to remain in the State (pdf)</a>*</li>
</ul><p><strong>*Migrants:</strong> In general, you may be eligible for housing
services if you are legally resident in Ireland and you have been living in the
relevant local authority area for a specific length of time. Otherwise, you may
get temporary help from an <a href="agencies_for_homeless_people.html">agency that provides services for
homeless people</a>.</p>

<p>Local authority housing is unfurnished. If you are offered a local authority
home and you do not have and cannot afford to buy furniture or appliances, you
may be eligible for help from the Department of Social Protection – see
'Social welfare' below.</p>

<h3>Renting privately</h3>

<p>If you cannot be housed by the local authority or a voluntary body, you can
look for <a href="../renting_a_home/looking_for_a_flat_or_house_to_rent.html">private
rented housing</a> and apply for a weekly <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a> to help pay the rent. Alternatively, and depending on where you
are, you may be eligible for the new <a href="../renting_a_home/housing_assistance_payment.html">Housing Assistance
Payment (HAP)</a>, which is being introduced to replace long-term Rent
Supplement. HAP is operational in several housing authorities and has been
extended on a pilot basis to eligible homeless households in the Dublin region.
The <a href="http://www.homelessdublin.ie/housing-assistance-payment-homeless-households">Homeless
HAP Pilot</a> is operated by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive. </p>

<h3>Transitional housing</h3>

<p>Transitional housing is for people who need time and assistance to prepare
for independent living. As well as providing medium-term accommodation, such
schemes generally support residents to build their skills and capacity to
establish themselves in a home and address any issues that might make long-term
housing unsustainable. Transitional housing is always time-limited and usually
ranges from 6 months to 2 years.</p>

<p>Some projects focus on particular groups, such as rough sleepers; single
parents; young people leaving State residential care. The services vary from
project to project but are directly linked to the needs of residents. They can
include individual needs analysis; personal planning and support; court
support; outreach; family support; counselling; advocacy; prison community
links; education and employment support; and life skills training
programmes.</p>

<p>These transitional housing projects can only be accessed through referrals
from other agencies. Transitional housing is funded through local authorities
and the Health Service Executive (HSE) or local organisations, depending on the
type of project. Residents pay a weekly charge towards their accommodation.</p>

<h3>Settlement services</h3>

<p>Settlement services work with people who are homeless to help them to move
from homelessness and into long-term, sustainable housing. They carry out
assessments and draw up a settlement plan with each person. They provide
support, advocacy and other assistance in accessing accommodation and
preparation for independent living. Post-settlement services provide
time-limited tenancy support to people who have moved to their own
accommodation.</p>

<h3>Long-term supported housing</h3>

<p>Long-term supported housing is for people who would not be able to live
independently, due to problems like addiction or mental illness. They are
offered a home for as long as is needed, with support as necessary. Some
projects target people with particular care needs. Many voluntary housing
bodies (often called housing associations) offer long-term supported
housing.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dubsimon.ie/Services/PreventingHomelessness/SupporttoLiveIndependently.aspx">Support
to Live Independently (SLÍ)</a> scheme provides long-term accommodation in
mainstream housing, together with appropriate time-limited supports to make the
transition from homelessness to independent living. It is mainly designed for
people who need low to moderate support and is provided through voluntary
organisations.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ladfa1">Social welfare</h2>

<p>Your entitlement to social welfare payments is not affected by the fact of
being homeless but you may have difficulty getting your payments mainly because
of not having a permanent address. You may make any claims for payments such as
<a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s
Allowance</a> or <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/benefits_to_people_who_are_sick_or_have_a_disability.html">illness
and disability payments</a> in the normal way.</p>

<p>For Rent Supplement and other payments under the Supplementary Welfare
Allowance Scheme, outside of Dublin and Cork, you apply in the normal way. If
you are in Dublin or Cork, you apply at the relevant Homeless Persons Unit.</p>

<p><strong>Migrants:</strong> Most weekly means-tested payments require that
you meet the <a href="../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitual
residence condition</a>, but you do not need to satisfy this condition in order
to get an Exceptional Needs Payment.</p>

<h4>Rent Supplement</h4>

<p>To be eligible for Rent Supplement, you must either have been assessed by a
local authority in the last 12 months as being qualified for social housing
support – see ‘Social housing’ above – or else have been living for 6
months (183 days) out of the last 12 months in one, or a combination, of the
following:</p>
<ul><li>Accommodation for homeless people</li>
  <li>An institution – for example, a hospital, care home or place of
    detention</li>
  <li>Private rented accommodation. You can combine time living in more than
    one rented accommodation to satisfy the 6 months (183 days). You must be
    able to show that you could afford the rent at the beginning of your
    tenancy and that you could have continued to pay rent but are unable to do
    so because of a change in your circumstances which occurred after you
    started renting.</li>
</ul><p>There may be flexibility in cases where landlords seek rents that are above
the Rent Supplement limits. This applies to existing tenants and to new Rent
Supplement applicants. The circumstances of tenants are considered on a
case-by-case basis and rents increased above the set limits as appropriate.
Contact the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/otheroffice/community-welfare-office-contact.aspx">local
office that administers your Rent Supplement</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, the Department of Social Protection, in conjunction with
Threshold, operates a special protocol in areas where supply issues are
particularly acute. Tenants in Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow and Cork city
can access the <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/housing-supports/dublin.html">Tenancy Protection
Service</a> on 1800 454 454.</p>

<h3>Other payments under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme</h3>

<p>As well as Rent Supplement, the <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/">Supplementary
Welfare Allowance</a> scheme also includes a basic weekly payment and some
discretionary payments. You may qualify for the weekly payment if you are not
entitled to any other social welfare payment or if you are waiting for your
claim for any other payment to be processed.</p>

<p>You may qualify for a discretionary payment if you are in need. The one most
immediately relevant for homeless people is an <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/exceptional_needs_payments.html">Exceptional
Needs Payment</a>. This is a one-off payment that you may get if you have
unforeseen expenses such as clothing, travel, rent deposit or costs relating to
setting up a home that you could not reasonably be expected to meet from your
weekly income.</p>

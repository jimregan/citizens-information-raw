<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>This document lists a number of agencies and organisations that provide
services to people who are homeless or at risk. While they are listed under the
main type of service provided, many of these bodies provide multiple supports
to homeless people, including advice and information on other options available
to them.</p>

<p>A growing number of people are either homeless or at risk of losing their
homes. Most of them are in the cities. There are dedicated services for
homeless people in Dublin and Cork.</p>

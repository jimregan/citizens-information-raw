<div class="topic">

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Young people become homeless for a range of reasons – it is rare that any
one event is the cause. Triggers might include conflicts within the family;
violence, abuse or neglect at home; drug or alcohol addiction; emotional or
behavioural problems; or leaving residential or foster care. Young people
leaving prison or juvenile detention centres may also be at risk. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="le42a5">What is youth homelessness?</h2>

<p>Youth homelessness is defined in the <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/publications/youth_homelessness_strategy.pdf">Youth
Homelessness Strategy (pdf)</a>, which builds on the work of the <a href="http://www.lenus.ie/hse/bitstream/10147/45696/1/8649.pdf">Forum on Youth
Homelessness (pdf)</a>. The Forum’s work covered homeless young people
between the ages of 12 and 20.</p>

<p>The Strategy and Forum both define youth homelessness to include any young
person who is:</p>
<ul><li>Sleeping on the streets </li>
  <li>Sleeping anywhere else not intended for night-time accommodation - this
    would include places such as parks, disused buildings, shop floors or bus
    shelters </li>
  <li>Living in accommodation intended for short stays, such as hostels,
    shelters, bed and breakfast accommodation or similar</li>
  <li>In insecure accommodation with friends or relatives, where they are at
    risk or are not in a position to stay in the long term </li>
</ul><p>Youth homelessness is similar to <a shape="rect" href="homelessness.html">adult homelessness</a> but it is also different. This
is mainly because the <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/family_support_agency.html">Child
and Family Agency</a> has a legal responsibility under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0017/index.html">Child
Care Act 1991</a> to provide for the care and welfare of children who can no
longer remain at home. The Act defines a child as a person under 18 years of
age who is not or has not been married. The Agency assumed responsibility in
January 2014 for the child welfare and protection services formerly operated by
the Health Service Executive (HSE). </p>

<p>A further difference between youth and adult homelessness is that most
children have a base or place of residence where they could potentially live.
They may be unable to stay living there, but their parent(s)/guardian or the
Child and Family Agency may still have responsibility for caring for them.
However, in the case of adults - people aged over 18 years - who are homeless,
no agency or body is legally obliged to provide specific services to them
purely on the basis of their homeless status. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="ldcbda">Arrangements for young homeless people</h2>

<p>Where children are identified as being at risk, the Agency has the right to
intervene for the child’s safety, if it is no longer safe for the child to
remain or return home. In such circumstances, the child may be placed in <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/adoption_and_fostering/fostering.html">foster
care</a> or in <a href="../../birth_family_relationships/services_and_supports_for_children/children_in_care.html">residential
care</a>. Children who are homeless, but who are not considered to be otherwise
at risk, are provided with accommodation under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0017/sec0005.html#zza17y1991s5">Section
5 of the Child Care Act 1991</a>. </p>

<p>Certain young people leaving residential care, foster care, prison, or <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/children_and_young_offenders/detention_of_children_and_young_people.html">juvenile
detention services</a> may be at risk of youth homelessness. The Child and
Family Agency works to reduce this risk by setting up aftercare supports for
such children. It is intended to put the requirement for an aftercare plan on a
statutory basis – see <a href="youth_homelessness.en.html#l1a728">After
leaving care</a> below.</p>

<p>Unaccompanied foreign nationals under 18 years arriving in the State by
ferry or air without their family are routinely referred to the Child and
Family Agency, which may then decide that an application for a <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/asylum_seekers_and_refugees/the_asylum_process_in_ireland/applying_for_refugee_status_in_ireland.html">declaration
as a refugee</a> should be made on behalf of the minor. The Agency makes
specific arrangements in conjunction with the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.orac.ie/">Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner</a>
forthe processing of such applications. The Agency is responsible for the
general care and well-being of the minor and will provide assistance to
them.</p>

<p>Many children and young people come into contact with homeless services
through voluntary agencies, through social workers or the Garda Síochána.
There are many <a href="agencies_for_homeless_people.html">organisations
working specifically with homeless people</a> and with homeless young people.
Agencies may provide <a href="housing_options_for_homeless_people.html">meals, advice, support,
hostel or other accommodation in addition to health and education
services</a>.</p>

<h3>Role of the Garda Síochána</h3>

<p>When the Gardaí find young people sleeping on the streets or in other
places not designed for night-time use, they generally contact the on-duty
social worker for the Child and Family Agency so that emergency accommodation
can be arranged. This can be in a residential children’s home; in a bed and
breakfast; or with foster parents. The Agency then assesses the needs of the
child for the short, medium and long term and, where necessary, it puts an
appropriate care plan in place. This may involve the child being returned home
or being placed in alternative care/accommodation, as appropriate.</p>

<p>In Dublin, the Crisis Intervention Service, which is also known as the
Out-of-Hours Service, is the initial point of contact for young people who
experience homelessness. This is a social work service that also deals with
accommodation. To access this service, the young person must go to a Garda
station. The station then contacts the Crisis Intervention Service.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l1a728">After leaving care</h2>

<p>The Child and Family Agency (Tusla) has responsibility for promoting the
welfare of children up to the age of 18. It may also help a child leaving care
if such help is required but it is not obliged to provide this help at present.
In practice, the <a href="http://www.tusla.ie/services/alternative-care/after-care">Agency does
provide aftercare</a> up to the age of 21, or to 23 if the young person is in
full-time education.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=3104">General Scheme
and Heads of the Aftercare Bill 2014</a> were published in February 2014. This
proposes that the Child and Family Agency will have a statutory duty to prepare
an aftercare plan for children who have spent some time in the care system and
who are soon to leave the system. That plan would include arrangements for
accommodation.</p>

<p>An aftercare guide <a href="https://www.focusireland.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pathwaysfinal.pdf">Pathways
(pdf)</a> is available on Focus Ireland's website. </p>

<h3>Social welfare payments</h3>

<p>Young people who were in the care of the Child and Family Agency (or
previously in the care of the HSE) before the age of 18 and who qualify for <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s
Allowance</a> when they reach 18 may get the full rate of the payment rather
than the reduced rates that apply to those aged between 18 and 26. Young people
who were not in care and who become homeless may qualify only for the reduced
rates.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="lef21f">Where to apply</h2>

<p>If you are a young person under 18 years, who is at risk or homeless, or if
you know a young person under 18 years who is at risk or homeless, contact the
<a href="http://www.tusla.ie/get-in-touch/local-area-offices/">Child and Family
Agency</a> or the <a href="http://www.garda.ie/Stations/Default.aspx">Garda

<h3>Responsibility to report child abuse</h3>

<p>None of the foregoing should be construed as superseding or diminishing the
statutory responsibility of the Child and Family Agency regarding the care and
protection of young people under the Child Care Act 1991 and all staff should
be aware of their responsibility to report <a href="../../birth_family_relationships/services_and_supports_for_children/child_abuse.html">child

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="ldb1e8">Homelessness and the law</h2>

<p>The main legislation dealing with homelessness includes the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1953/en/act/pub/0026/index.html">Health
Act 1953</a>, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1988/en/act/pub/0028/index.html">Housing
Act 1988</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0017/index.html">Child
Care Act 1991</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1988/en/act/pub/0028/sec0002.html#zza28y1988s2">Section
2 of the Housing Act 1988</a> states that you are considered homeless if:</p>
<ul><li>There is no accommodation available that, in the opinion of the local
    authority, you and any other person who normally lives with you or who
    might reasonably be expected to live with you, can reasonably occupy or
    remain in occupation of, or</li>
  <li>You are living in a hospital, county home, night shelter or other such
    institution, and you are living there because you have no suitable
    accommodation or</li>
  <li>You are, in the opinion of the local authority, unable to provide
    accommodation from your own resources</li>
</ul><p>In general, you may be considered homeless if you are:</p>
<ul><li>Sleeping rough</li>
  <li>Staying in an emergency hostel or refuge</li>
  <li>Staying in bed and breakfast or hotel accommodation on a temporary
  basis</li>
  <li>Staying temporarily with friends or family because you have nowhere else
    to go</li>
  <li>Squatting (occupying a building illegally)</li>
</ul><p>Often the term ‘out-of-home’ is used to refer to people who have nowhere
to live. This term recognises the fact that you may have a home that you cannot
return to (for whatever reason).</p>

<h3>Duties of the State towards homeless people</h3>

<p>At present, there is no explicit right to housing in the Constitution or in
Irish law. The Constitutional Convention recommended in February 2014 that <a href="https://www.constitution.ie/AttachmentDownload.ashx?mid=adc4c56a-a09c-e311-a7ce-005056a32ee4">the
Constitution should be amended to include economic, social and cultural
rights</a>, including a specific right to housing, but no decision has yet been
made on this recommendation.</p>

<p>While local authorities do not have a statutory obligation to house people,
they do have general responsibility under the Housing Act 1988 for the
provision of housing for adults who cannot afford to provide it for themselves.
They may help with accommodation either by providing housing directly or
through arrangements with voluntary housing organisations and other voluntary
bodies. They may also provide funding to voluntary bodies for emergency
accommodation and for long-term housing for homeless people.</p>

<p>The Act also requires that local authorities carry out periodic assessments
of the number of people who are homeless in their administrative area, as part
of their housing needs assessment – see 'National profile of homelessness'
below.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/">Health Service Executive (HSE)</a> has
general responsibility for the health and in-house care needs of homeless
people. In terms of funding, this means that local authorities are responsible
for the costs of providing accommodation while the HSE provides funding for the
care and welfare needs of homeless people, including in-house care.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://tusla.ie/">Child and Family Agency (Tusla)</a> has
responsibility under the Child Care Act 1991 for providing accommodation for
people under the age of 18 who are homeless or in need of care. It may also
provide aftercare facilities for young people aged over 18. Read more in our
document on <a shape="rect" href="youth_homelessness.html">youth

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l7d4e0">Why do people become homeless? </h2>

<p>The reasons for people becoming homeless are both complex and wide-ranging
but there is a particular risk at present for families with tenancies in the <a href="../renting_a_home/tenants_rights_and_obligations.html">private
rented</a> sector.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad,32437,en.pdf">Ending
Homelessness – A Housing-Led Approach (pdf)</a>, research shows that the
following are the main factors that lead to homelessness:</p>
<ul><li>Housing and financial crises</li>
  <li>Discharge from institutions</li>
  <li>Family breakdown, including domestic violence</li>
  <li>Substance abuse</li>
  <li>Mental health issues</li>
  <li>The transition from youth to adulthood for young people in care or who
    were homeless as young people</li>
</ul><p>Many people are homeless for relatively short periods, for reasons linked to
issues such as loss of employment, eviction or relationship breakdown. Others
who experience multiple forms of social exclusion may become homeless in the
long term, especially if they have been homeless before they become adults.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lfa2b2">National profile of homelessness</h2>

<p>There are several different methods of counting the number of homeless
people. While it is difficult to provide an accurate figure, it is clear that
very many people are either homeless or at risk of losing their homes.
Homelessness is generally concentrated in urban areas and the majority of
homeless people are in Dublin.</p>

<p>The Housing Act 1988 requires local authorities to carry out assessments of
housing need. The homeless people who are included in this assessment are those
who are registered with the local authority and have been assessed as being in
need of housing. The most recent <a href="https://www.housing.ie/our-services/research-services/most-viewed-publications.aspx">housing
need assessment</a> was carried out in 2011.</p>

<p>Census 2011 was the first time that comprehensive information was collected
on the number of homeless people in the State. Homeless people were counted on
the basis of where they were on Census night and the count was undertaken with
the help of the homelessness services. The results were published in <a href="http://cso.ie/en/census/census2011reports/homelesspersonsinirelandaspecialcensus2011report/">Homeless
Persons in Ireland; A special Census report</a>.</p>

<p>The Dublin Region Homeless Executive conducts a rough sleeper count in the
Dublin region every 6 months. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad,18192,en.pdf">The
Way Home – A Strategy to Address Adult Homelessness 2008-2013 (pdf)</a>,
which was published in 2008, set out the aim of ending homelessness by 2016. A
<a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad,20035,en.pdf">national
implementation plan (pdf)</a> was published in 2009 and the Programme for
Government (2011) included a commitment to ending homelessness and the need to
sleep rough by implementing a housing-led approach.</p>

<p>In February 2013, the Government issued a <a href="http://www.environ.ie/sites/default/files/migrated-files/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad,32434,en.pdf">Homelessness
Policy Statement (pdf)</a>. The overall strategy and aims of <em>The Way
Home</em> continue to be Government policy but with the explicit recognition of
the housing-led approach, which means that long-term secure housing, with
social supports if necessary, is seen as the best outcome for homeless
people.</p>

<p>The statement provided for the setting up of the Homelessness Oversight
Group, which published its <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad,34865,en.pdf">first
report (pdf)</a> in December 2013. The Group’s recommendations included the
maintenance of funding at 2013 levels for the years 2014 to 2016 and the
establishment of a Homelessness Policy Implementation Team.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.environ.ie/sites/default/files/migrated-files/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad%2C38053%2Cen.pdf">Implementation
Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness – May 2014 to December 2016
(pdf)</a> prioritises the following:</p>
<ul><li>Accommodating rough sleepers and therefore eliminating the need to sleep
    rough</li>
  <li>Managing the escalating number of homeless families in the Dublin
  region</li>
  <li>Management and use of vacant properties</li>
  <li>The practical application of local authority housing allocations and</li>
  <li>The timely and appropriate utilisation of NAMA units</li>
</ul><p>The <a href="http://www.environ.ie/sites/default/files/migrated-files/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad%2C39779%2Cen.docx">Action
Plan to Address Homelessness</a>, published in December 2014, lists immediate
actions to address rough sleeping in Dublin, as well as further actions to
tackle systemic issues, grouped under prevention, accommodation and supports.
As part of the Action Plan, an evaluation of the homelessness sector will be
commissioned in 2015.</p>

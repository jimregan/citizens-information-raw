<p>If you are a tenant of a <a shape="rect" href="housing_associations.html">housing association</a> or other voluntary
housing organisation, your tenancy is now covered by the residential tenancies
legislation. Housing associations, co-operatives and similar organisations,
known as <em>approved housing bodies</em> (AHBs) were brought under the scope
of this legislation on <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/docs/default-source/legislative-changes/changes-commenced-7th-april-2016.docx?sfvrsn=2">7
April 2016</a>. Two major effects of this change are:</p>
<ul><li>Your landlord (the housing association) must <a href="../renting_a_home/registering_a_tenancy.html">register your
    tenancy</a> with the <a href="../renting_a_home/private_residential_tenancies_board.html">Residential
    Tenancies Board (RTB)</a></li>
  <li>If problems arise with your tenancy, you or your landlord (or a neighbour
    affected by the problems) can access the RTB’s <a href="../renting_a_home/disputes_between_landlords_and_tenants.html">dispute
    resolution service</a></li>
</ul></div>

<p>As noted above, since <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/docs/default-source/legislative-changes/changes-commenced-7th-april-2016.docx?sfvrsn=2">7
April 2016</a> housing associations and other approved housing bodies come
under the scope of the residential tenancies legislation. On this date the
relevant sections of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/42/enacted/en/html">Residential
Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015</a>, which amended the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/enacted/en/html">Residential
Tenancies Act 2004</a>, came into effect.</p>

<p>While there are several types of approved housing body, the term <em>housing
associations</em> is often used when referring to all types. <a href="http://www.environ.ie/housing/social-housing/voluntary-and-cooperative-housing/approved-housing-bodies-ahbs">Read
more about these bodies</a>.</p>

<p>Tenants of housing associations now have the same rights and obligations as
tenants in private rented housing, with some exceptions, which are:</p>
<ul><li>The <a href="../renting_a_home/repairs_maintenance_and_minimum_physical_standards.html">minimum
    standards</a> for food preparation, storage and laundry purposes do not
    apply to housing associations, so they do not have to provide their tenants
    with white goods, such as washing machines</li>
  <li><a href="../renting_a_home/rent_increases.html">Rent reviews</a> will
    be carried out in accordance with the tenancy agreement (if there is one)
    or else no more than once a year. There is no specific notice period in the
    legislation, but it does state that notice must be given as soon as is
    practicable.</li>
  <li>You may not assign or sublet the housing association tenancy</li>
  <li>While most housing association tenants will get <a href="../renting_a_home/types_of_tenancy.html">security of tenure</a>
    – known as <em>Part 4</em> rights – after 6 months or more into the
    tenancy, this does not apply if you are living in transitional
    accommodation and the tenancy is for 18 months or less</li>
  <li>While the housing association can validly <a href="../renting_a_home/if_your_landlord_wants_you_to_leave.html">end
    your tenancy</a> providing all the legal requirements are met, it cannot
    terminate a Part 4 tenancy for the reason that it requires the dwelling for
    its own or family member occupation</li>
</ul><p>Read more in our document on <a href="../renting_a_home/tenants_rights_and_obligations.html">tenants’
rights and obligations</a> and in the RTB’s guide <a href="http://prtb.ie/tenants/rights-responsibilities-obligations/good-tenant-guide">Being
a good tenant</a>. The RTB also has <a href="http://www.rtb.ie/tenants">information for tenants</a> on its website.</p>

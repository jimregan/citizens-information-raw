<p>If you want to move to another local authority home, you can register on
your local authority’s transfer list. </p>

<p>To qualify for the transfer list, you may have to meet a number of criteria,
such as not having any <a href="rent_arrears.html">rent arrears</a>. The
criteria you must meet to qualify for the transfer list are usually outlined in
the local authority’s housing allocations scheme, which is generally
published on its website.</p>

<p>You may be able to arrange a private transfer by finding someone who wants
to swap their home with yours. This must not result in any overcrowding and the
local authority must give its permission.</p>

<p>You can also arrange a private transfer with someone from a different local
authority, as long as the accommodation is suitable and the 2 local authorities
agree.</p>

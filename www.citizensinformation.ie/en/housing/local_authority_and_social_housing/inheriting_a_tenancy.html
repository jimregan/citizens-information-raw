<p>A relative who has been living with a tenant may be able to take over the
tenancy if the tenant dies. Local authority practice varies on this; some will
require the relative to have lived in the house for a minimum number of years,
others will only allow the relative to take over the tenancy if the housing is
suitable for their needs. The rules for <em>succession to tenancy</em> are
usually outlined in the local authority's housing allocations scheme.</p>

<p>Housing associations have established their own policies on this. If you are
a housing association tenant, contact your housing association for information
on inheriting a tenancy. </p>

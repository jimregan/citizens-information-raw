<p>If you are getting <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a> for a long period and you are in need of long-term housing, you
may be eligible for the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS). The scheme is run by
local authorities. The local authority makes the final decision regarding who
is eligible under the scheme. In general, people who are getting Rent
Supplement for more than 18 months are considered for RAS.</p>

<p>A significant difference between RAS and Rent Supplement is that tenants who
take up full-time employment can stay in the RAS scheme, with a recalculated
rent – see ‘Rates’ below. </p>

<p>It is intended that the <a href="../renting_a_home/housing_assistance_payment.html">Housing Assistance
Payment (HAP)</a> will eventually replace RAS. However, you cannot transfer
from RAS to HAP. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Under the Rental Accommodation Scheme, local authorities draw up contracts
with landlords to provide housing for an agreed term for people with a
long-term housing need. The local authority pays the rent directly to the
landlord. You may continue to contribute to your rent but you pay this
contribution to your local authority, not to your landlord. </p>

<p>The key elements of the scheme are:</p>
<ul><li>Local authorities pay the full rent to the landlord on behalf of the
    tenant </li>
  <li>Landlords must register tenancies with the <a shape="rect" href="../renting_a_home/private_residential_tenancies_board.html">Private
    Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB)</a> and the tenancies are governed by
    the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/enacted/en/html">Residential
    Tenancies Act 2004</a></li>
  <li>The property must meet <a shape="rect" href="../renting_a_home/repairs_maintenance_and_minimum_physical_standards.html">minimum
    standards for private rental accommodation</a></li>
  <li>Deposits are <strong>not</strong> required, since the local authority has
    entered into a contract with the landlord</li>
  <li>Tenants who take up full-time employment can stay renting under RAS</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The rent that you pay is calculated according to the local authority’s
differential rent scheme. If your income increases, you will be asked for a
higher contribution towards the rent. </p>

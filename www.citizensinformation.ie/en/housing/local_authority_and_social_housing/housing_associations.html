<p><strong>Housing associations</strong> are independent, not-for-profit
charities. In general, they provide affordable rented housing for people who
cannot afford to pay private sector rents or buy their own homes, or for
particular groups, such as older people or homeless people.</p>

<p><strong>Housing co-operatives</strong> are organisations of tenants or
owners where the members share responsibility for the management and upkeep of
their homes. Tenant housing co-operatives are very similar to housing
associations.</p>

<p>These voluntary housing organisations are known as <em>approved housing
bodies</em> (AHBs). This means that they have been approved under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1992/act/18/section/6/enacted/en/html">Housing
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992</a> for the purpose of accessing assistance
from local authorities for housing provision. While there are differences
between the various types of organisation involved, the term “housing
associations” is also often used to cover all voluntary housing
organisations. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l7d10f">Regulation of approved housing bodies</h2>

<p><a href="http://rtb.ie/search-results/news/article/2016/04/08/new-amendments-to-the-legislation-effective-from-7th-april-2016">On
7 April 2016</a>, approved housing bodies were brought under the remit of the
<a href="../renting_a_home/private_residential_tenancies_board.html">Residential
Tenancies Board (RTB)</a> and they must now <a href="../renting_a_home/registering_a_tenancy.html">register their
tenancies</a> with the RTB. Approved housing bodies now have the same <a href="../renting_a_home/landlords_rights_and_obligations.html">rights and
obligations</a> as private landlords and their tenants have the same <a href="../renting_a_home/tenants_rights_and_obligations.html">rights and
obligations</a> as private tenants, with some exceptions. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lc97a3">Range of services</h2>

<p>There are over 500 approved housing bodies and they vary widely in size and
in the services that they provide. As well as providing affordable rented
housing, they generally aim to encourage community development.</p>

<p>Some were established by existing caring organisations that provide services
to special needs groups, such as older people or people with disabilities. Some
also offer non-housing services, such as group meals, social activities and
welfare advice. Some facilitate people who wish to live in a different area.
Examples of these are the <a href="http://www.safehomeireland.com/">Safe-Home
programme</a>, which is for older Irish-born emigrants living in rented
accommodation who wish to return to Ireland, or <a href="http://www.ruralresettlement.com/index.html">Rural Resettlement
Ireland</a>, for urban dwellers wishing to resettle their families in a rural
area.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>In order to be housed by an approved housing body, you must normally be
registered on the local authority housing waiting list in your area. To be
registered on the housing waiting list, your income must be below a prescribed
level. (There are 3 maximum income thresholds that apply to different local
authorities.) You must also have a need for housing, that is, your current
housing circumstances must be unsuitable. Read more in our document on <a href="applying_for_local_authority_housing.html">applying for local authority
housing</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to be considered for housing provided by an approved housing
body, make sure you tick the box marked “voluntary/co-operative housing” in
the ‘Housing Requirements’ section of the application form.</p>

<p>The housing department of your <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local
authority</a> will be able to tell you if there are approved housing bodies
active in your area. In most cases, the local authority will refer you to an
AHB if an appropriate vacancy arises. A very small number of AHBs may accept
direct applications.</p>

<p>You can read <a href="http://www.environ.ie/housing/social-housing/voluntary-and-cooperative-housing/approved-housing-bodies-ahbs">more
about approved housing bodies</a> and view the <a href="http://www.environ.ie/housing/social-housing/voluntary-and-cooperative-housing/register-housing-bodies-approved-status">register</a>,
which lists over 500 bodies that are currently approved. You can search for <a href="http://icsh.ie/content/search-for-members">contact information

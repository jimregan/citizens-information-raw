<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Local authorities have <a href="notice_to_quit_and_eviction.html">specific powers to evict</a> anyone
who is engaging in anti-social behaviour. This means being involved in
drug-dealing or in any behaviour that might cause danger, injury, damage or
fear to people living in the area - such as violence, threats, intimidation or
harassment.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l7009d">Excluding Orders</h2>

<p>A tenant may him/herself apply for an Excluding Order against a member of
his/her household who is engaging in anti-social behaviour. However, this may
be very difficult for the victim of anti-social behaviour to do.</p>

<p>As an alternative to the tenant taking action, the local authority or
housing association can apply to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a> for an
Excluding Order against any member of a household who is engaging in
anti-social behaviour. The order may exclude that person from a specific house
or from an entire estate and it may forbid intimidation or other interference
with a tenant or anyone else.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1d91f">Consequences of anti-social behaviour</h2>

<p>A local authority can refuse to let a dwelling or sell one under the <a href="buying_your_local_authority_house.html">tenant purchase scheme</a> on
the grounds of anti-social behaviour.</p>

<p>The Department of Social Protection may refuse or withdraw <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a> for a private rented dwelling where the person in question was
evicted, excluded or removed from local authority housing on the grounds of
anti-social behaviour.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you are a local authority tenant who is affected by someone's anti-social
behaviour, you should contact your local authority. If you are a housing
association tenant who is affected by someone's anti-social behaviour, you
should contact the housing association. </p>

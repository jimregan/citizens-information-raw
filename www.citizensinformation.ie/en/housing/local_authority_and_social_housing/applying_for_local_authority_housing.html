<div class="topic">

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Local authorities are the main providers of social housing (or <em>housing
authorities</em>) for people who cannot afford to buy their own homes. Local
authority housing is allocated according to eligibility and need. Rents are
based on the household’s ability to pay. </p>

<p><a href="housing_associations.html">Housing associations and housing
co-operatives</a> also provide social housing for people who cannot afford to
buy their own homes. These organisations are often called <em>approved housing
bodies</em>. </p>

<p>Three sets of regulations prescribe how housing authorities should handle
social housing applications. They are the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2011/si/84/made/en/print">Social
Housing Assessment Regulations 2011</a>, the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2011/si/136/made/en/print">Social
Housing Assessment (Amendment) Regulations 2011</a> and the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2011/si/321/made/en/print">Social
Housing Assessment (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2011</a>.</p>

<p>Important elements of these Regulations include:</p>
<ul><li>You can only apply to one housing authority</li>
  <li>In general, you must already be living in the area covered by that
    housing authority or have a local connection with the area – though a
    housing authority may agree to waive this requirement</li>
  <li>You will only be considered for social housing if your household income
    is less than the threshold that applies in the housing authority’s
  area</li>
  <li>If your current mortgage is unsustainable, this will be taken into
    consideration in assessing your household’s need for social housing - see
    'Need' below </li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>In order to qualify, you must be <strong>eligible</strong> for social
housing and you must be <strong>in need of</strong> social housing. </p>
<ul><li>The housing authority will assess your eligibility first</li>
  <li>It will only assess whether you need social housing after it has deemed
    you to be eligible </li>
</ul><p><strong>Foreign nationals:</strong> you must have a legal right to remain in
the State on a long-term basis. Detailed rules are contained in <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad,29412,en.pdf">Circular
Housing 41/2012 (pdf).</a></p>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<p>To be regarded as eligible for social housing you must satisfy the income
criteria.</p>

<p>You must also show that you do not have suitable alternative
accommodation.</p>

<p><strong>Income criteria:</strong></p>

<p>The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has
published <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad,29413,en.pdf">detailed
guidance (pdf)</a> on how household income is to be assessed by local
authorities. There are 3 maximum income thresholds that apply to different
housing authorities. The Department has published a <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad,29414,en.pdf">table
showing these maximum net income limits (pdf)</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Alternative accommodation:</strong></p>

<p>You will be regarded as having alternative accommodation if a member of the
household has property that the household could reasonably be expected to live
in. This includes property that is being rented out – (under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0027/print.html">Residential
Tenancies Act 2004</a> you can terminate the tenancy if the household needs the
property to live in).</p>

<p>A property will not be regarded as alternative accommodation in the
following cases:</p>
<ul><li>It is occupied by someone who is divorced or separated* from a member of
    the household, or whose civil partnership with a household member has been
    dissolved</li>
  <li>It would be overcrowded if the household lived in it</li>
  <li>It is unfit for human habitation</li>
  <li>It would not adequately meet the accommodation requirements of a
    household member with a disability </li>
</ul><p>* A couple does not have to be <a href="../../birth_family_relationships/separation_and_divorce/judicial_separation.html">judicially
separated</a> in order for this to apply. A deed of separation is sufficient
– see our document on <a href="../../birth_family_relationships/separation_and_divorce/separation_agreement.html">separation
agreements</a>. </p>

<h3>Need</h3>

<p>When deciding whether your household is in need of social housing, the
housing authority must consider the following questions in relation to your
current accommodation:</p>
<ul><li>Is it an institution, emergency accommodation or hostel?</li>
  <li>Is it overcrowded?</li>
  <li>Is it fit for human habitation?</li>
  <li>Does it meet the accommodation requirements of a household member with a
    disability?</li>
  <li>If it is shared with another household, have you a reasonable requirement
    for separate accommodation?</li>
  <li>Is it unsuitable for your household’s adequate housing in any other
    material respect, having regard to particular household circumstances, or
    on exceptional medical or compassionate grounds?</li>
</ul><p>And added by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2011/si/321/made/en/print">Social
Housing Assessment (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2011</a> </p>
<ul><li>Has your household’s current mortgage has been classified as
    unsustainable as part of the <a href="../owning_a_home/mortgage_arrears/mortgage_arrears_resolution_process.html">Mortgage
    Arrears Resolution Process (MARP)</a> laid down by the Central Bank?</li>
</ul><h3>Areas of choice</h3>

<p>You can specify up to 3 areas where you would choose to live. At least one
of them must be in the area administered by the housing authority that you
apply to (its ‘functional area’) and the others must be either in that
functional area or within the same county. If you do not live in or have a
connection with the housing authority’s own functional area, but the
authority has agreed to accept an application from you, you can only pick areas
of choice within that particular authority’s functional area.</p>

<p>The Social Housing Assessment (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations update some of
the detailed rules as regards areas of choice and changes of mind. </p>

<h3>Housing waiting lists</h3>

<p>If you are accepted by the housing authority as being eligible for and in
need of housing, you are then placed on its waiting list, now known as a
‘record of qualified households’, and the housing authority will also
notify any other housing authority in whose functional area you have specified
an area of choice.</p>

<p>Each housing authority draws up its own rules for deciding order of priority
on the waiting list. These are called ‘schemes of letting priorities’. You
can get a copy from your housing authority. Some housing authorities operate a
points system, giving each household on the list a number of points depending
on its circumstances.</p>

<p>If you want to know your position on the waiting list, ask your housing
authority. Your position may go up or down depending on the circumstances of
other people on the waiting list and as your own circumstances change. In
practice, priority is generally given to families and older people rather than
single people or couples without children.</p>

<h3>Allocation of housing</h3>

<p>As houses and flats become available for letting, they are allocated from
the waiting list in order of priority, taking account of all the relevant
circumstances.</p>

<p>When the housing authority is planning to offer you accommodation, it must
review its assessment of your household’s eligibility and need for social
housing. It must also confirm that your application is still valid as regards
connection with the area and selection of ‘area of choice’.</p>

<p>If you are offered a house or flat that you do not want, you can refuse it.
However, if the local authority thinks that you do not have a good reason for
refusing the offer, it may reduce your priority on the waiting list,
particularly if you refuse more than one offer.</p>

<p>Local authority housing is unfurnished. If you are offered a local authority
home and you do not have and cannot afford to buy furniture or appliances, you
may be eligible for <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/exceptional_needs_payments.html">help
under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme</a>.</p>

<h3>Refusal to allocate housing</h3>

<p>If you or a member of your household has previously been in local authority
housing, the housing authority will not allocate housing to you if you or a
household member has:</p>
<ul><li>(a) Damaged a dwelling or site previously provided by any housing
    authority, without repairing the property or paying for repairs </li>
</ul><p>or</p>
<ul><li>(b) Breached the terms of a local authority tenancy agreement, leading to
    the authority ending the tenancy </li>
</ul><p>or</p>
<ul><li>(c) Built up rent arrears for 12 weeks or more in any period of 3 years
    as a local authority tenant, without either paying them off or arranging to
    pay them </li>
</ul><p>However, the Social Housing Assessment (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations allow
housing authorities, in exceptional circumstances, to consider providing social
housing support to households in situations (a) or (b) above. </p>

<h3>Support with paying private rent </h3>

<p>If you are in private rented accommodation while waiting for local authority
housing, you may be eligible for <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a>. People who have been on Rent Supplement for a long time may
switch to the <a href="rental_accommodation_scheme.html">Rental
Accommodation Scheme (RAS)</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../renting_a_home/housing_assistance_payment.html">Housing
Assistance Payment (HAP)</a>, which will eventually replace long-term Rent
Supplement, is gradually being introduced. If you are housed under HAP, you
will no longer be on the local authority’s housing list. However, you can
apply for transfer to other forms of social housing. If you do apply for a
transfer as soon as you enter HAP, any time that you spent on the housing list
can be taken into account when your local authority considers your
application.</p>

<h3>Local authority rents</h3>

<p>Local authority rents are based on a system called 'differential rents'.
This means that the rent is based on your ability to pay, so if your income is
low, your rent will be low; and if your income increases, so will your rent.
The income of any other members of your household will be added to the rent
calculation and there may be deductions for any children in your family. Each
local authority operates its own rent scheme.</p>

<p>Your local authority may have a minimum and/or maximum rent, which may
depend on the size of your home. There is also a hardship clause that gives
local authorities discretion to reduce the rent if there are particular reasons
to do this.</p>

<p>If your income or the income of anyone in your household changes, you must
inform the local authority.<br></p>

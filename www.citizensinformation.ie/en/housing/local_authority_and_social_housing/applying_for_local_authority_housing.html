<div class="topic">

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Local authorities (or <em>housing authorities</em>) are the main providers
of social housing for people who cannot afford to buy their own homes. Local
authority housing is allocated according to eligibility and need. Rents are
based on the household’s ability to pay. </p>

<p><a href="housing_associations.html">Housing associations and housing
co-operatives</a> also provide social housing for people who cannot afford to
buy their own homes. These organisations are often called <em>approved housing
bodies</em>. </p>

<p>Several sets of <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/ResultsSITitle.html?q=Social+Housing+Assessment+Regulations+&amp;=&amp;=">Social
Housing Assessment Regulations</a> prescribe how housing authorities should
handle social housing applications. </p>

<p>Important elements of these Regulations include that:</p>
<ul><li>You can only apply to one housing authority</li>
  <li>In general, you must already be living in the area covered by that
    housing authority or have a local connection with the area – though a
    housing authority may agree to waive this requirement</li>
  <li>You will only be considered for social housing if your household income
    is less than the threshold that applies in the housing authority’s
  area</li>
  <li>If your current mortgage is unsustainable, this will be taken into
    consideration in assessing your household’s need for social housing - see
    'Need' below </li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>In order to qualify, you must be <strong>eligible</strong> for social
housing and you must be <strong>in need of</strong> social housing. </p>
<ul><li>The housing authority will assess your eligibility first</li>
  <li>It will only assess whether you need social housing after it has deemed
    you to be eligible </li>
</ul><p><strong>Foreign nationals:</strong> you must have a legal right to remain in
the State on a long-term basis. Detailed rules are contained in <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad,29412,en.pdf">Circular
Housing 41/2012 (pdf).</a></p>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<p>To be regarded as eligible for social housing you must satisfy the income
criteria.</p>

<p>You must also show that you do not have suitable alternative
accommodation.</p>

<p><strong>Income criteria:</strong></p>

<p>The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has
published <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad,29413,en.pdf">detailed
guidance (pdf)</a> on how household income is to be assessed by local
authorities. There are 3 maximum income thresholds that apply to different
housing authorities. The Department has published a <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad,29414,en.pdf">table
showing these maximum net income limits (pdf)</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Alternative accommodation:</strong></p>

<p>You will be regarded as having alternative accommodation if a member of the
household has property that the household could reasonably be expected to live
in. This includes property that is being rented out – under the <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/en_act_2004_0027.htm">Residential
Tenancies legislation</a> you can <a href="../renting_a_home/if_your_landlord_wants_you_to_leave.html">terminate
the tenancy</a> if the household needs the property to live in.</p>

<p>A property will not be regarded as alternative accommodation if it:</p>
<ul><li>Is occupied by someone who is divorced or separated* from a member of the
    household, or whose civil partnership with a household member has been
    dissolved</li>
  <li>Would be overcrowded if the household lived in it</li>
  <li>Is unfit for human habitation</li>
  <li>Would not adequately meet the accommodation requirements of a household
    member with a disability </li>
</ul><p>* A couple does not have to be <a href="../../birth_family_relationships/separation_and_divorce/judicial_separation.html">judicially
separated</a> in order for this to apply. A deed of separation is sufficient
– see our document on <a href="../../birth_family_relationships/separation_and_divorce/separation_agreement.html">separation
agreements</a>. </p>

<h3>Need</h3>

<p>When deciding whether your household is in need of social housing, the
housing authority must consider the following questions:</p>
<ul><li>Is your current accommodation an institution, emergency accommodation or
    hostel?</li>
  <li>Are you homeless within the meaning of <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1988/act/28/section/2/enacted/en/html">section
    2 of the Housing Act 1988</a>? </li>
  <li>Is your current accommodation overcrowded?</li>
  <li>Is it fit for human habitation?</li>
  <li>Does it meet the accommodation requirements of a household member with a
    disability?</li>
  <li>Is it unsuitable for your household’s adequate housing on exceptional
    medical or compassionate grounds?</li>
  <li>If it is shared with another household, have you a reasonable requirement
    for separate accommodation?</li>
  <li>Has your household’s current mortgage been classified as unsustainable
    as part of the <a href="../owning_a_home/mortgage_arrears/mortgage_arrears_resolution_process.html">Mortgage
    Arrears Resolution Process (MARP)</a> laid down by the Central Bank? </li>
  <li>Is your household dependent on <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
    Supplement</a> to meet its housing need?</li>
  <li>Is your current accommodation unsuitable for your household’s adequate
    housing in any other material respect, having regard to particular
    household circumstances?</li>
</ul><p>The most recent updates to these questions were made by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/si/288/made/en/print">Social
Housing Assessment (Amendment) Regulations 2016</a>, which, among other
changes, added the questions on homelessness and Rent Supplement.</p>

<h3>Areas of choice</h3>

<p>You can specify up to 3 areas where you would choose to live. At least one
of them must be in the area administered by the housing authority that you
apply to (its <em>functional area</em>) and the others must be either in that
functional area or within the same county. If you do not live in or have a
connection with the housing authority’s own functional area, but the
authority has agreed to accept an application from you, you can only pick areas
of choice within that particular authority’s functional area.</p>

<h3>After your application is accepted</h3>

<p>If you are accepted by the housing authority as being eligible for and in
need of housing, you are then placed on its housing list or <em>record of
qualified households</em>, and it will also notify any other housing authority
in whose functional area you have specified an area of choice.</p>

<p>If you are in private rented accommodation while you are on the housing
list, you may be eligible for <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a>. If you are housed under the <a href="../renting_a_home/housing_assistance_payment.html">Housing Assistance
Payment (HAP)</a>, which is legally defined as a form of social housing
support, you will no longer be on the housing list. However, if you apply for a
transfer from HAP to another form of social housing <strong>within 2 weeks of
getting the letter confirming your HAP payment</strong>, any time that you
spent on the housing list can be taken into account when your local authority
considers your application.</p>

<p><a href="social_housing_waiting_lists.html">Read more about the housing
list and the allocation process.</a></p>

<h3>If you get a local authority home </h3>

<p>Local authority housing is unfurnished. If you are offered a local authority
home and you do not have and cannot afford to buy furniture or appliances, you
may be eligible for <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/exceptional_needs_payments.html">help
under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme</a>.</p>

<p>Local authority rents are based on a system called <a href="http://www.housingagency.ie/housing-information/what-is-social-housing/renting-from-my-local-authority.aspx">differential
rents</a>. This means that the rent is based on your ability to pay, so if your
income is low, your rent will be low; and if your income increases, your rent
will increase also. The income of any other members of your household will be
added to the rent calculation and there may be deductions for any children in
your family. Each local authority operates its own rent scheme.</p>

<p>Your local authority may have a minimum and/or maximum rent, which may
depend on the size of your home. There is also a hardship clause that gives
local authorities discretion to reduce the rent if there are particular reasons
to do this.</p>

<p>If your income or the income of anyone in your household changes, you must
inform the local authority, so that it can recalculate your rent.<br></p>

<p>If you have a joint tenancy and your relationship with your joint tenant has
broken down and he/she has left the home, you will probably want his/her name
removed from the tenancy agreement with the local authority or housing
association.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If your joint tenant agrees to have their name removed, the local authority
or housing association will do this. However, if they refuse to have their name
removed, it is more complicated and you will have to provide evidence that the
relationship has broken down.</p>

<p>One of the factors considered in a <a href="../../birth_family_relationships/separation_and_divorce/factors_in_separation_divorce.html">judicial
separation, divorce or dissolution</a> is occupation of the <a href="../../birth_family_relationships/separation_and_divorce/family_home.html">family/shared
home</a>. The judge can order a transfer of tenancy. If you are in a situation
where a relationship is breaking down, you should seek legal advice.</p>

<p>If you are left living alone in the family home, the local authority or
housing association may consider that your house is too big for you and offer
you alternative accommodation, unless you can argue that you have occasional
custody of your children and need somewhere for them to stay.</p>
</div>
If you have left the family home and removed your name from the joint tenancy
agreement, you can <a href="applying_for_local_authority_housing.html">apply
to the local authority for accommodation</a>.<div class="topic base_howtoapply">

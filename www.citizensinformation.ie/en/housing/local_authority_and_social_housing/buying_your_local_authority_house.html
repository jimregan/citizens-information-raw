<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Several purchase schemes have been developed to enable tenants of local
authority houses or apartments to buy their homes from the local authority.
They include the Tenant Purchase of Apartments Scheme (TPAS) and the 2010
Incremental Purchase Scheme for newly built houses – both outlined below.</p>

<p>A new incremental purchase scheme has been introduced – see below. It
replaces the 1995 Tenant Purchase Scheme, which is closed to new applicants –
see ‘1995 Tenant Purchase Scheme’ below.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lf3fe5">Incremental purchase - 2016 scheme </h2>

<p>A <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/DevelopmentHousing/Housing/News/MainBody,43637,en.htm">new
incremental tenant purchase scheme</a> has been introduced under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/si/484/made/en/print">Housing
(Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015</a>, with effect from 1
January 2016.</p>

<h3>Rules</h3>

<p>To qualify for this new scheme, you must have been getting social housing
support for at least a year on the date of application and you must have an
annual income of at least €15,000 per year. You may be able to get a <a href="../owning_a_home/help_with_buying_a_home/local_authority_mortgages.html">local
authority mortgage</a>. </p>

<p>You will get a discount of 60%, 50% or 40% off the purchase price of the
house, depending on your income. An incremental charge, equivalent to the
discount, will be placed on the house. Over a specified period of years, this
charge will reduce to nil in annual increments of 2% of the total value of the
house, unless you resell the house or breach the conditions of sale during this
specified period.</p>

<p>If you sell the house within this specified period, you will have to pay the
outstanding incremental charge on the house to the local authority.</p>

<p>There is <a href="http://www.environ.ie/housing/home-ownership/tenant-purchase-scheme/tenant-purchase">information
about the scheme</a> on environ.ie, including an <a href="http://www.environ.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/2016_02_19_-_tenant_information_booklet_-_tips_2016.pdf">information

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l8f67e">Tenant Purchase of Apartments Scheme
(TPAS)</h2>

<p>This scheme came into effect on 1 January 2012.</p>

<p>For an apartment complex to be eligible for designation for tenant purchase,
it must:</p>
<ul><li>Comprise at least 5 apartments (other than community apartments)</li>
  <li>Not contain retail units or apartments designed for older people</li>
  <li>Satisfy criteria set out in <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/22/section/51/enacted/en/html#sec51">Section
    51 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009</a></li>
</ul><p>In addition, at least 65% of tenants must support designation of the
complex.</p>

<p>When apartments are being sold in a designated complex, the housing
authority transfers ownership of the entire complex to an apartment owners’
management company. The management company immediately leases all the
apartments back to the authority for continued letting to tenants, who will
then have the option of buying them from the authority.</p>

<p>Sales follow the incremental purchase model. There are discounts of 40%, 50%
or 60% off the purchase price, depending on household income. There is also a
local authority charge, which reduces by a set proportion each year.</p>

<h3>Before apartments are sold</h3>

<p>Housing authorities have to undertake a considerable amount of preparatory
work before they can sell individual apartments to tenants. This work
includes:</p>
<ul><li>Assessing the suitability of selected apartment complexes</li>
  <li>Establishing annual maintenance costs in order to calculate annual
    service charges for people buying apartments</li>
  <li>Consulting tenants and conducting a vote</li>
</ul></div>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld9dbe">Incremental purchase - 2010 scheme</h2>

<p>An <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/DevelopmentHousing/Housing/HomeOwnership/IncrementalPurchaseScheme/">Incremental
Purchase Scheme for newly built houses</a> was launched in June 2010, to allow
people who qualify for social housing (including existing social housing
tenants) to buy designated newly built houses from a local authority or
approved housing body at a discount.</p>

<p>The 2016 incremental purchase scheme for existing local authority houses,
described above, is modelled on this 2010 scheme.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lb410c">1995 Tenant Purchase Scheme (for houses
only)</h2>

<p>The 1995 scheme is closed for new applicants. If you bought a house under
this scheme and want to sell the house within 20 years of the date you bought
it, or before you have acquired full ownership, you must get the consent of the
local authority.</p>

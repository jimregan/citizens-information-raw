<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Up to recently, a local authority could evict a tenant without giving a
reason, as long as it followed the correct procedure. This meant first issuing
a <em>notice to quit</em> and then applying to court for an order. However, in
practice, local authorities did not evict their tenants without reason. If you
paid your rent and complied with other conditions of the tenancy, you would
normally be able to stay in your home for as long as you wanted.</p>

<p>The main reason for repossessions of local authority rented accommodation in
recent years has been arrears of rent. Anti-social behaviour has also been the
cause of some repossessions.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="ldacc0">Legal basis for repossession</h2>

<p>Up to recently, the legal basis for repossession was <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1966/en/act/pub/0021/sec0062.html">Section
62 of the Housing Act 1966</a>. In 2012, the <a href="http://www.courts.ie/Judgments.nsf/60f9f366f10958d1802572ba003d3f45/c6f4944e0e6e995e802579bb0052a4d5?OpenDocument&amp;Highlight=0,donegan%20">Supreme
Court held</a> that this section was not compatible with the European
Convention on Human Rights because it did not allow for an independent hearing
of the merits of the proposed repossession.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/act/21/enacted/en/index.html">Housing
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014</a> replaces Section 62 with new
procedures, which involve an independent assessment of the merits of the
proposed repossession. These procedures are set out in <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0021/sec0006.html#part2">Part
2 of the Act</a>, which <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2015/en/si/0121.html">came into effect on
13 April 2015</a>.</p>

<p>The new procedures apply where local authorities want to repossess
because:</p>
<ul><li>There has been a serious or repeated breach of a condition of the tenancy
    agreement, for example, <a href="anti_social_behaviour.html">anti-social
    behaviour</a> or <a href="rent_arrears.html">non-payment of rent</a>
  </li>
</ul><p>or</p>
<ul><li>The dwelling has been abandoned by the tenant and is occupied by a
    squatter</li>
</ul><p>or</p>
<ul><li>The tenant has died and the dwelling is occupied by someone who is not
    entitled to <a href="inheriting_a_tenancy.html">succeed to the
    tenancy</a></li>
</ul><p>The new procedures provide that a local authority may issue a tenancy
warning if there is an alleged breach of the tenancy conditions, such as
non-payment of rent or anti-social behaviour. A tenancy warning may not be
necessary in the case of very serious breaches, but if the local authority
applies to repossess the dwelling without first issuing a tenancy warning, the
application for a possession order must state the reasons why no such warning
was issued.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l6e21b">Tenancy warnings</h2>

<p>The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 sets out detailed
requirements as regards tenancy warnings. The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2015/en/si/0122.html">Housing (Local
Authority Tenancy Warnings) Regulations 2015</a> set out who can be validly
served with a warning in the tenant’s absence; alternative methods for
serving a warning; and the type of circumstances to be taken into account for
extending the period in which the tenant can seek a review.</p>

<p>Sections 7 and 8 of the Act set out particular requirements for how tenancy
warnings should be issued where the terms of the tenancy agreement have been
breached as regards anti-social behaviour (Section 7) and rent-related
obligations (Section 8). See below for the specific requirements for such
tenancy warnings.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0021/sec0009.html#sec9">Section
9</a> deals with tenancy warnings in relation to breaches of the tenancy
agreement as regards any other matter. Such a warning must specify the breach,
what needs to be done and the possibility that the local authority may look for
a possession order against the tenant.</p>

<h3>Anti-social behaviour</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0021/sec0007.html#sec7">Section
7</a> deals with tenancy warnings in relation to <a href="anti_social_behaviour.html">anti-social behaviour</a> and similar
behaviour – including nuisance or conduct likely to annoy or disturb
neighbours, or allowing a person to be in the dwelling in breach of an <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0021/sec0003.html">order
excluding them</a> from it.</p>

<p>The tenancy warning must:</p>
<ul><li>Set out what part of the tenancy agreement has been breached, the nature
    of the breach and the name (if known) of the household member involved</li>
  <li>Say when the breach occurred and its detrimental effects on the quality
    of life of people living nearby</li>
  <li>Require the tenant to ensure that the household member involved does (or
    stops doing) certain things so as to stop these detrimental effects
    continuing or happening again</li>
  <li>Warn the tenant that the local authority may initiate repossession
    proceedings or seek an excluding order if the breach continues or happens
    again within 12 months</li>
  <li>Warn the tenant that this tenancy warning may be taken into account over
    the next 3 years if the tenant, the household or the household member
    involved wishes to buy a local authority house or to be allocated another
    local authority dwelling</li>
  <li>Set out the tenant’s right to request a review of the tenancy
  warning</li>
</ul><h3>Rent arrears</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0021/sec0008.html#sec8">Section
8</a> deals with tenancy warnings in relation to breaches of <em>rent-related
obligations</em> – either the rent agreed in the tenancy agreement or
whatever repayments were agreed in a rescheduling arrangement.</p>

<p>The tenancy warning must:</p>
<ul><li>Set out the rent-related obligation that has been breached, the amount of
    arrears now owing and the period over which rent was not paid</li>
  <li>Require the tenant to pay the arrears immediately or, in case of
    hardship, contact the local authority to discuss rescheduling the
  payments</li>
  <li>Warn the tenant that the local authority may initiate repossession
    proceedings if the arrears are not paid or rescheduled within 2 months</li>
  <li>Warn the tenant that, even if the rent arrears are paid or rescheduled
    within 2 months, the local authority may initiate repossession proceedings
    (without a further tenancy warning) if the tenant misses a payment in the
    next 12 months, unless a further rescheduling is arranged</li>
  <li>Set out the legal provisions as regards rent arrears that have not been
    rescheduled</li>
  <li>Set out the tenant’s right to request a review of the tenancy
  warning</li>
</ul><p>If the local authority knows that the tenant has other debts as well as the
rent arrears, the tenancy warning must also include information on sources of
advice on <a href="../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/dealing_with_debt.html">problem
debt in general</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld7c35">After a tenancy warning has issued</h2>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0021/sec0010.html#sec10">Section
10 of the Act</a> the tenant is entitled to request an internal review of a
tenancy warning. This request should normally be made within 10 working days of
the issue of the warning – or within 20 working days in exceptional
circumstances. The request should outline the grounds on which it is made,
include any supporting documents and indicate whether the tenant or a household
member wishes to make oral representations as part of the review. The review
must be carried out by a local authority official who was not involved in the
initial warning and who is more senior than the official who issued the
warning.</p>

<p>In general, the reviewer should conclude the review within 20 working days
of being appointed. However, if the review involves meeting the tenant or a
household member, or if a variation to the warning is proposed, this may take
up to 30 working days. The reviewer can decide to confirm the tenancy warning,
vary its terms (after giving the tenant a chance for feedback) or annul the
warning. The local authority must send the tenant a written copy of the
decision.</p>

<p>In the case of intimidation, the reviewer can accept a statement by a Garda
or a local authority official as evidence that a person has been engaged in
anti-social behaviour.</p>

<p>If the tenant does not ask for a review, the warning takes effect from the
second working day after the period for requesting a review has expired. If the
tenant has asked for a review, and the warning has been upheld or varied, it
comes into effect on the second working day after the decision was sent to the
tenant.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l52699">Applying for repossession</h2>

<p>If the tenant does not deal with the breach of the tenancy agreement, even
after the tenancy warning, the local authority can apply to the District Court
for a possession order to enable it to repossess the dwelling. The court
hearing may be held <em>in camera</em> in some cases. The court may order the
ending of the tenancy or, in the case of anti-social behaviour, may order the
exclusion of a member of the household from the tenancy.</p>

<p>The local authority must generally give the tenant at least 10 days’
notice of the court hearing, but if the breach of the tenancy agreement is
having serious effects on people living nearby, it must give the tenant a copy
of the possession application as soon as it applies for the order, with a
written explanation of why the tenant was not given the 10 days’ notice.</p>

<p>The possession application must give the grounds for the application,
including full details of the breach, the name of person causing it (if known)
and its effects on people living nearby. The application must also give details
of any tenancy warnings issued to the tenant or household members within the
last 5 years. If no tenancy warning was issued for the current breach, the
application must give reasons why one was issued. If there is a tenancy warning
for a similar breach currently under review, the application must give the
reasons why the possession order is being sought at the same time.</p>

<p>If a possession order is granted, it gives the date on which the local
authority can repossess the dwelling. This must be no sooner than 2 months (and
no later than 9 months) after the date of the order. The tenancy will be
terminated on the date that the local authority takes possession of the
dwelling under the possession order.</p>

<h3>Abandoned dwellings</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0021/sec0014.html#sec14">Section
14 of the Act</a> allows the local authority, in certain circumstances, to
enter an abandoned dwelling that is at risk of damage or trespass. The local
authority can do this either with the tenant’s consent or with a warrant from
the District Court. However, if that property has been vandalised or is at
imminent risk of damage, the local authority can enter it to do whatever is
necessary, without getting a warrant.</p>

<p>If the local authority plans to repossess an abandoned dwelling, it must
give the tenant 4 weeks to confirm whether or not they intend to occupy it
again. After 4 weeks, the local authority can serve a notice on the tenant,
ending the tenancy, and can then take possession of the dwelling without any
further proceedings. The former tenant may apply to the District Court (within
6 months) for the termination to be reconsidered.</p>

<h3>Occupiers who are not tenants</h3>

<p>If someone who is not entitled to a tenancy is occupying a dwelling, the
local authority can apply to the District Court for a possession order, setting
out its grounds. It must have regard to protecting the identity of anyone who
informed it of the occupation, if there is reason to believe that this is
necessary.</p>

<p>If the tenant has died and the occupier is (or claims to be) a member of the
late tenant’s household, but is not entitled to succeed to the tenancy, the
local authority can apply for a possession order, setting out its grounds. If
the occupier has applied for a succession tenancy and been refused, the
possession application must give the basis for that refusal and refer to the
local authority’s written policy on succession tenancies.</p>

<p>At least 10 working days before the District Court hearing, the local
authority must give the occupant written notice of the hearing and details of
the possession application.</p>

<p>The Court may decide to hear some or all of the case <em>in camera</em>.</p>

<p>The Court can make a possession order if it appears that:</p>
<ul><li>The local authority has grounds for the recovery of possession</li>
  <li>Repossession is a proportionate response to the occupier’s occupation
    of the dwelling and</li>
  <li>Making such an order is reasonable in all the circumstances</li>
</ul><h3>Appeals</h3>

<p>All decisions in the District Court (such as the granting of a possession
order) may be appealed to the Circuit Court and a further appeal on a point of
law may be made to the High Court.</p>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l066d3">Housing association tenants</h2>

<p><a shape="rect" href="housing_associations.html">Housing associations</a>
can evict you without any reason as long as they follow the correct procedure.
This means first issuing a notice to quit and then applying to court for a
possession order. However, in practice, housing associations do not evict their
tenants without reason and if you pay your rent and comply with other
conditions of the tenancy, you will normally be able to stay in your home for
as long as you want.</p>

<p>If you are in temporary accommodation provided by a housing association,
such as a short-term hostel, your position is much weaker and legally the
housing association does not even need to issue a notice to quit. Again,
however, in practice, housing associations do not evict their tenants without
reason.</p>

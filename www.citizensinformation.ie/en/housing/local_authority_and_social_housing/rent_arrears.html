<p>If you are renting your home from a local authority, you have agreed to pay
a weekly rent, which is based on your household's income. If your income is
reduced, you should contact the local authority immediately to look for an
adjustment in your rent.</p>

<p>If you find you are falling behind with the rent, for whatever reason, you
will build up an amount of rent arrears. It is vital to talk to the local
authority to discuss these arrears. You may be able to agree with the local
authority to pay a certain amount off the rent arrears each week.</p>

<p>If you donâ€™t arrange to pay off the arrears, you could end up <a href="notice_to_quit_and_eviction.html">losing your home</a>.</p>

<p>Many local authorities have <em>tenancy sustainment programmes</em> to help
support tenants, particularly if they are in rent arrears. You should ask your
local authority for this assistance as early as possible. </p>

<p>There is a hardship clause that gives local authorities the ability to
reduce a household's rent if there are particular reasons to do so. For
example, the local authority may reduce your rent if your household is badly
affected by exceptional social factors that make it difficult for it to
function or to pay the rent due, or if it would cause undue hardship for your
household to pay the full rent.</p>

<p>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) is a <span>free, confidential
service</span> for people who are having <a href="../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/dealing_with_debt.html">problems

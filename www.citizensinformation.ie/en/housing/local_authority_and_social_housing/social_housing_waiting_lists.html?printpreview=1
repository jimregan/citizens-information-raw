<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Local authorities maintain records of people who are qualified for social
housing support and who have not yet received it. As social housing becomes
available, the local authority allocates it to people who are on its <em>record
of qualified households</em> – more commonly known as the housing list.</p>

<p>Before offering you accommodation, the local authority must review its
assessment of your application and confirm that your household still qualifies.
From 2016 on, local authorities are also required to review all applications on
their housing lists each year and prepare a summary report - see 'Summary of
social housing assessments' below.</p>

<p>As well as the main housing lists, local authorities also maintain lists of
people who have <a href="getting_a_transfer_to_another_local_authority_home.html">applied for a
transfer</a> from their current accommodation.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Getting on the social housing list</h3>

<p>When you <a href="applying_for_local_authority_housing.html">apply for
social housing</a>, the local authority assesses your application to determine
your household’s eligibility and need for social housing. If you are accepted
as being qualified, your details are placed on the housing list. The local
authority will also notify any other local authority in whose area you have
specified an area of choice.</p>

<h3>While you are on the housing list</h3>

<p>Each local authority draws up its own rules for deciding the order of
priority on the housing list. These are called <em>allocation schemes</em> and
are generally published on the local authority’s website.</p>

<p>Some local authorities operate a points system, giving each household on the
list a number of points depending on its circumstances. If your circumstances
change – for example, you have a new baby – you should tell the local
authority so that it can update your household’s record. You should also tell
the local authority if your address has changed since you went on the housing
list.</p>

<p>If you want to know your position on the housing list, ask the local
authority. Your position may go up or down depending on the circumstances of
other people on the list and as your own circumstances change. In practice,
priority is generally given to families and older people rather than single
people or couples without children.</p>

<h3>Renting privately</h3>

<p>If you are in private rented accommodation while waiting for local authority
housing, you may be eligible for <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a>. People who have been on Rent Supplement for a long time may
switch to the <a href="rental_accommodation_scheme.html">Rental
Accommodation Scheme (RAS)</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../renting_a_home/housing_assistance_payment.html">Housing
Assistance Payment (HAP)</a>, which will eventually replace long-term Rent
Supplement, is gradually being introduced. If you are housed under HAP, you
will no longer be on the local authority’s housing list, as HAP is defined in
<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/act/21/section/37/enacted/en/html#sec37">Section
37 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014</a> as being a social
housing support.</p>

<p>However, you can apply for transfer from HAP to another form of social
housing. If you apply for a transfer <strong>within 2 weeks of getting the
letter confirming your HAP payment</strong>, any time that you spent on the
housing list can be taken into account when your local authority considers your
application. If you apply for a transfer at a later date, the time that you
previously spent on the housing list will not count.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lb089d">Allocation of housing</h2>

<h3>The allocation process</h3>

<p>In general, as houses and flats become available for letting, they are
allocated from the housing list in order of priority, taking account of all the
relevant circumstances. However, a new system of <em>choice-based letting</em>,
which has been piloted in some local authority areas, is now being extended.
The Choice-Based Letting (CBL) allocation system allows social housing
applicants to express their interest in available properties.</p>

<p>When the local authority is planning to offer you accommodation, it must
review its assessment of your household’s eligibility and need for social
housing. It must also confirm that your application is still valid as regards
connection with the area and selection of area of choice.</p>

<p>If you have chosen to be considered for accommodation provided by a <a href="housing_associations.html">housing association or other approved
housing body</a> (by ticking the 'voluntary/co-operative housing' box on the
social housing application form) one of these organisations may contact you if
suitable accommodation becomes available.</p>

<h3>Refusing an offer</h3>

<p>If you are offered a house or flat that you do not want, you can refuse it
without affecting your place on the housing list. However, if the local
authority thinks that you do not have a good reason for refusing the offer, it
may reduce your priority on the list. If you refuse more than one reasonable
offer in any 12-month period, you will be suspended from the list for 12
months, during which you cannot claim Rent Supplement.</p>

<h3>Refusal to allocate housing</h3>

<p>If you or a member of your household has previously been in local authority
housing, the housing authority will not allocate housing to you if you or a
household member has:</p>

<p>(a) Damaged a dwelling or site previously provided by any housing authority,
without repairing the property or paying for repairs</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>(b) Breached the terms of a local authority tenancy agreement, leading to
the authority ending the tenancy</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>(c) Built up rent arrears for 12 weeks or more in any period of 3 years as a
local authority tenant, without either paying them off or arranging to pay
them</p>

<p>However, the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2011/si/321/made/en/print">Social
Housing Assessment (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2011</a> allow local
authorities, in exceptional circumstances, to consider providing social housing
support to households in situations (a) or (b) above.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l864d2">Summary of social housing
assessments</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/22/section/21/enacted/en/html#sec21">Section
21 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009</a> requires each local
authority to prepare a summary of the social housing assessments carried out in
its area. A national summary of social housing assessments is carried out
periodically. The most recent <a href="http://www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/migrated-files/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad,34857,en.pdf">Summary
of Social Housing Assessments (pdf)</a> was in 2013. From 2016 onward, this
will be done every year.</p>

<p>The 2016 summary is being carried out under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/si/287/made/en/print">Social
Housing Assessments (Summary) Regulations 2016</a>. Local authorities are
contacting all households on their housing lists to confirm that they are still
qualified for social housing support. The information being requested covers
income, family size and current housing conditions.</p>

<p>It is important for all households to respond to the local authority in good
time with the details requested. If your address has changed since you went on
the housing list, you should contact the local authority and give it your
current address.</p>

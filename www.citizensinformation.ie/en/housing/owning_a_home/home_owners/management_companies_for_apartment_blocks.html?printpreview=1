<div class="topic">

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Since 1 April 2011, the <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/en_act_2011_0002.htm">Multi-Unit
Developments Act 2011</a> regulates the ownership and management of the common
areas of multi-unit developments, and provides for the setting up of owners’
management companies to manage such areas.</p>

<p>A multi-unit development is a development in which there are at least 5
residential units and the units share facilities, amenities and services. In
practice, the majority of multi-unit developments are apartment blocks, but the
Act also covers groups of houses that share common facilities and have an
owners’ management company. In addition, it for some rules in relation to
developments with between 2 and 4 residential units and it applies to mixed
commercial and residential developments to a certain extent.</p>

<p>The Act provides that an owners' management company must be set up, and the
common areas of the development transferred to it, before the developer sells
any units. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="ldd397">Common areas</h2>

<p>The Act defines common areas as including:</p>
<ul><li>The external walls, foundations and roofs and internal load-bearing
  walls</li>
  <li>The entrance halls, landings, lifts, lift shafts, staircases and
  passages</li>
  <li>The access roads, footpaths, kerbs, paved, planted and landscaped areas,
    and boundary walls</li>
  <li>Architectural and water features</li>
  <li>All ducts and conduits, other than those within and serving only one unit
    in the development</li>
  <li>Cisterns, tanks, sewers, drains, pipes, wires, central heating boilers,
    other than such items within and serving only one unit in the
  development</li>
  <li>Other areas that are from time to time provided for common use</li>
</ul><h3>Developer's obligations</h3>

<p>Under the Act, before the sale of any unit in the development may take
place, the developer of a multi-unit development is obliged to:</p>
<ul><li>Establish an owners’ management company. The common areas of the
    development must have been transferred to that management company. This
    must be done at the expense of the developer.</li>
  <li>Enter into a contract with the owners' management company which outlines
    the responsibility of each to the other and deals with issues such as
    compliance with statutory requirements, completion of the common areas (for
    which the developer remains responsible), retention money (usually, money
    retained by the company to ensure that the developer completes the project)
    and dispute resolution; the owners’ management company must have separate
    legal representation in the negotiation of the contract.</li>
  <li>Supply a certificate under the Building Control Acts from a suitably
    qualified person regarding compliance with fire safety in the development.
    The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/si/0096.html">Multi-Unit
    Developments Act 2011 (Section 3) (Prescribed Persons) Regulations 2011</a>
    specify that suitably qualified people are architects, building surveyors
    and chartered engineers.</li>
  <li>Do all things that are reasonably necessary to ensure that the unit owner
    enjoys the rights and amenities necessary for the reasonable use and
    peaceful occupation of the units. </li>
</ul><h3>Transfer of common areas</h3>

<p>When the common areas are transferred to the company, the developer
continues to have the right to be in those common areas in order to complete
them. The developer must have a valid insurance policy in place in respect of
all risks relating to the developer’s use or occupation of the multi-unit
development. The developer must also indemnify the owners’ management company
against claims in respect of acts or omissions by the developer during
completion works.</p>

<p>There is a general obligation on the developer to minimise inconvenience to
the unit owners and ensure that access is available to them at all reasonable
times.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l22387">Owners' management company</h2>

<p>The owner of each residential unit is entitled to membership of the
owners’ management company and is generally entitled to one vote. Where
alternative arrangements are already in operation, these may be continued,
provided they are just and equitable.</p>

<p>The owners' management company is part of the conveyancing procedure for the
individual units. If the unit is subsequently sold or transferred to another
person, the membership of the owners’ management company automatically
transfers to the new owner. It will not be necessary to formally execute the
transfer or have it approved by the directors of the company. </p>

<p>The Act refers to the organisations that manage multi-unit developments as
owners’ management companies even if the organisation is not a company. For
example, an unincorporated group or body may be responsible for the management
but they are under the same obligations as owners’ management companies that
are incorporated as companies.</p>

<h3>Obligations of owners’ management companies</h3>

<p>Owners’ management companies must comply with company law generally and
with the specific obligations imposed by this Act. All directors are limited to
a term of 3 years. The main specific obligations of an owners’ management
company are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Register of members</strong></p>

<p>The company must supply the buyer of a residential unit with a share or
membership certificate and ensure that the register of members is updated. The
members are obliged to keep the company informed of any relevant changes.</p>

<p><strong>Annual report</strong></p>

<p>The company must prepare an annual report and hold an annual meeting to
discuss the report. The report must include details of income and expenditure,
annual service charges, the sinking fund account, planned expenditure on
maintenance and repair, insurance cover and contracts entered into by the
company. The members must be given 21 days’ notice of the meeting and be
provided with the report 10 days before the meeting. The annual general meeting
must take place reasonably close to the multi-unit development unless 75% of
the members of the company agree otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>Service charges</strong></p>

<p>The company must establish a scheme for annual service charges to pay for
the maintenance, insurance and repair of common areas within its control and
for the provision of common services (for example, security) to unit owners.
The initial charge may be set without holding a meeting of the members but, in
general, these charges must be approved by a general meeting of the members. If
over 75% of the members do not approve the proposed charge, the existing charge
must remain in place. </p>

<p>The service charge may not be used to pay for matters that are the
responsibility of a developer or builder unless this is agreed in writing by
75% of the members of the company. This approval may only be given if 65% of
the units are sold and can only come into effect 3 years after the transfer of
ownership of the common areas to the owners’ management company. </p>

<p>Unit owners are obliged to pay the service charge (including developers in
the case of unsold units).The service charge must be calculated on a
transparent and fair basis and expenditure must be properly recorded.</p>

<p><strong>Sinking fund</strong></p>

<p>Within 3 years of the transfer of ownership to it, the owners’ management
company must establish a sinking fund for spending on refurbishment,
improvement or maintenance of a non-recurring nature of the multi-unit
development. Unit owners are obliged to make contributions to it (including
developers in the case of unsold units). The Act provides that the amount is to
be €200 annually or such other amount as the members agree. Contributions to
the sinking fund must be held in a separate account.</p>

<p><strong>House rules</strong></p>

<p>The owners’ management company may make house rules for the effective
operation and maintenance of the multi-unit development. These rules must be
agreed by a meeting of members but the first set of rules may be made by the
company before the sale of the first unit. Where a unit is let, it must be a
term of the letting that it is subject to the observance of the house rules by
the tenants.</p>

<p><strong>Long-term contracts</strong></p>

<p>The company may not enter into contracts with providers of goods and
services which are to last for more than 3 years.</p>

<h3>Dispute resolution</h3>

<p>Any person affected may apply to the Circuit Court for an order to enforce
any rights conferred or obligation imposed under the Act. This includes the
owners’ management company, a unit owner, a trustee under a will or other
settlement and the developer.</p>

<p>The Court, instead of making an order, may direct the parties to attempt to
solve the matter by mediation.</p>

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>In 2012, a Household Charge of €100 <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/DevelopmentHousing/Housing/HouseholdCharge/">was
charged on residential property</a> in order to fund local services. This
charge was an interim measure. It was separate from, and in addition to, the <a href="new_local_authority_charges_on_residential_property.html">Non-Principal
Private Residence (NPPR)</a> charge. <strong></strong></p>

<p>The <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/housing_taxes_and_reliefs/local_property_tax.html">Local
Property Tax (LPT)</a> was introduced in 2013 and replaced the Household
Charge. </p>

<h3>How the Household Charge operated</h3>

<p>If you owned a residential property in Ireland on 1 January 2012, even if
you were living abroad, you were obliged to declare your liability for the
Household Charge and pay it to the Household Charge bureau by the due date.
Virtually all private residential properties were liable for the charge,
including apartments and bedsits, as well as second homes or other property on
which you had to pay the Non-Principal Private Residence (NPPR) charge. A
detailed set of <a href="https://www.householdcharge.ie/Faq.aspx">Frequently
asked questions</a> is published on the <a href="http://www.householdcharge.ie/">Household Charge website</a>. </p>

<p>Certain people and properties were not liable - see 'Waivers' and
'Exemptions' below. You may wish to re-check which unfinished housing estates
qualify for waivers, as some estates were unintentionally omitted from the
original published lists.</p>

<p>If you wish to sell or transfer the property at any stage, you will need
proof that the Household Charge was paid or that a waiver or exemption applied.
The relevant certificates are described <a href="https://www.householdcharge.ie/Faq.aspx#fk47">here</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lbba33">If you have not yet paid the Household
Charge</h2>

<p>If you have not already paid the Household Charge and you owned a dwelling
on 1 January 2012, you are liable for the Household Charge on it, subject to
certain waivers and exemptions - see below. </p>

<p>If your house was rented out, you are liable for the charge, not your
tenant. However, if it was let on a lease of more than 20 years, the person to
whom it was leased is the owner for the purposes of the charge.</p>

<h3>Paying arrears</h3>

<p>Since 1 July 2013, any outstanding Household Charge has been increased to
€200 and added to the Local Property Tax (LPT) on the property. It is being
collected through the LPT system - read more in <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/housing_taxes_and_reliefs/paying_local_property_tax.html">our
document on paying the LPT</a>. </p>

<p>If your outstanding Household Charge has been transferred to the LPT system,
details of the property will have been recorded by Revenue – you do not need
to register it with the Household Charge bureau.</p>

<p>Read more about Household Charge arrears on the <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/lpt/faqs/household.html">Revenue
website</a>.</p>

<h3>Waivers</h3>

<p>If you are in one of the following 2 situations, you can claim a <a href="https://www.householdcharge.ie/Forms/Waivers%20from%20Household%20Charge.pdf">waiver
(pdf)</a> from the Household Charge. You must complete the Household Charge
application form to register for the waiver – see <a href="#lcdc09">How to
apply</a> below. </p>
<ul><li>If you were entitled to <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/mortgage_interest_supplement.html">Mortgage
    Interest Supplement</a> on the liability date (1 January 2012) you can
    claim a <a href="https://www.householdcharge.ie/Faq.aspx#fk38">waiver of
    the Household Charge</a></li>
  <li>People living in certain unfinished housing estates* can also claim a
    waiver. <a href="https://www.householdcharge.ie/Faq.aspx#fk30">Details of
    qualifying estates</a> are published on the Household Charge website.</li>
</ul><p>*You may wish to re-check the list of unfinished estates qualifying for
waivers in your county, as some estates were unintentionally omitted from the
original published lists. If your home is in one of the listed estates and you
did not pay the Household Charge, you must still register for a waiver. If you
did pay the charge, you can request a refund – see <a href="#lcdc09">How to
apply</a> below. </p>

<h3>Exemptions</h3>

<p>Certain residential properties were exempt from the 2012 Household
Charge.The <a href="https://www.householdcharge.ie/Faq.aspx#fk40">exemptions
are listed</a> on the Household Charge website. There is no need to register
exempt properties.</p>

<p>The Household Charge legislation did not provide an exemption for properties
affected by pyritic damage, though residential properties that are certified as
having significant pyritic damage qualify for an exemption from Local Property
Tax (LPT).</p>

<p>However, Revenue will treat outstanding Household Charge arrears, which have
now been converted into €200 of LPT, as coming within the scope of the LPT
exemption, so if you qualify for the pyrite exemption from LPT for 2013 and/or
2014 you will not be required to pay the €200 of Household Charge arrears.</p>

<p>Read more in <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/lpt/faqs/household.html#section18">Revenue’s
FAQs</a>.</p>

<h3>Deceased owners</h3>

<p>If the owner of a residential property has died, the personal representative
of the deceased is liable for the charge if a grant of representation has been
taken out. If no grant has been taken out, no charge is payable.</p>

<p>The personal representative will be liable to pay any outstanding charges
within 3 months of taking out a grant of representation – these charges are
those which were outstanding at the time of the owner’s death. If the
personal representative does not pay any outstanding charges within this
3-month period, the charges and interest start to accumulate again from the
date of the grant of representation. </p>

<p>The last date for grant of representation to qualify for payment of the
Household Charge was 30 June 2013. The payment must have been made to the
Household Charge bureau within 3 months of that date – by 30 September
2013.</p>

<p>If the grant of representation was made on or after 1 July 2013, or if the
payment was not made within 3 months of the grant of representation, then the
€200 LPT applies and is handled by Revenue.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The Household Charge was €100, payable (along with any penalties) in a
single payment.</p>

<p><strong>Late payment penalties</strong></p>

<p>Late payment interest and fees were applied if you did not pay the charge in
full by 31 March 2012 or set up a direct debit. </p>

<p>The arrears were capped at €130 if you paid by 30 April 2013. For payments
in May 2013, the total payable was €144 and for payments in June 2013 the
total was €145.</p>

<p>If your Household Charge payment was still outstanding on 1 July 2013, it
was increased to €200 and added to the Local Property Tax (LPT) payable on
the property. If you do not pay this additional €200, interest and penalties
will apply under the LPT system - see <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/housing_taxes_and_reliefs/paying_local_property_tax.html">our
document on paying the LPT</a><a href="#lbba33"></a>.</p>

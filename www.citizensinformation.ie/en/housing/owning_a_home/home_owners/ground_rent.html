<p>The 2 types of property ownership in Ireland are <em>leasehold</em> and
<em>freehold</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Owning the leasehold interest</strong> in a property means that you
own just the building and not the land it is on and that your ownership is for
a fixed number of years. If you own a leasehold property, you must pay a ground
rent to your <em>ground landlord</em> - the person who owns the ground it is
built on. The amount of ground rent paid varies. Often the ground landlord is
the local authority.</p>

<p><strong>Owning the freehold interest</strong> in a property means that you
own the land and buildings (if any) outright. There is no period of years
attached to the ownership and there is no ground rent to pay. </p>

<p>When you are buying or selling a property, any ground rent will be recorded
on the previous deeds (if the property is registered with the Registry of
Deeds) or on the folio (if the property is registered with the Land Registry).
The <a href="http://www.prai.ie/">Property Registration Authority (PRA)</a>
controls and manages both the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds. Read
more in <a href="../buying_a_home/property_deeds.html">our document on
property deeds</a>. </p>

<p>The PRA 's <a href="http://www.prai.ie/category/services/grservices/">Ground
Rents Purchase Scheme</a> allows leasehold owners to buy out their ground rent
and become outright owners of their property. </p>

<p>In some circumstances it is not possible to buy out ground rents, if, for
instance, it is not in the public interest, or if there is a specific clause in
a lease preventing it, but these instances are rare. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="ldd299">Buying out your ground rent </h2>

<p>A person who is buying a property may be able to buy out the ground rent
once the purchase of the property has been concluded. You can buy it either
privately or through the <a href="http://www.prai.ie/category/services/grservices/">Ground Rents Purchase
Scheme</a>. </p>

<p>The amount to be paid when buying out the ground rent can either be agreed
between you and the ground landlord (consent procedure) or else obtained
through an arbitration procedure. The amount of ground rent is set by the
arbitration procedure if you are buying it out under the Ground Rents Purchase
Scheme and cannot agree the amount with the ground landlord. The PRA will do
all the legal work for a fee. It is more expensive if an arbitrator is involved
- see 'Rates' below. </p>

<p>If you buy out your ground rent, whether from a private landlord or a local
authority, the PRA will issue a Vesting Certificate. The Vesting Certificate is
a new title deed to your property. As such, it is a very important document.
You are strongly advised to have it registered with the Land Registry or the
Registry of Deeds, as appropriate, to record the fact that your ownership of
the property has changed from leasehold to freehold. </p>

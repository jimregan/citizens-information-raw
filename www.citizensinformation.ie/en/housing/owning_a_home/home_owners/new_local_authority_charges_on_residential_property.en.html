<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>An annual charge applied from 2009 to 2013 in respect of residential
property that was not the owner’s only or main residence in those years. This
Non-Principal Private Residence charge or NPPR was introduced by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0030/print.html">Local
Government (Charges) Act 2009</a> to go towards funding local authority
services. In 2012 and 2013, it was payable along with other property taxes, as
follows:</p>
<ul><li>For the year 2012, the <a href="household_charge.html">Household
    Charge</a> was payable on the property in addition to the NPPR</li>
  <li>For the year 2013, the <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/housing_taxes_and_reliefs/local_property_tax.html">Local
    Property Tax (LPT)</a> was payable in addition to the NPPR</li>
</ul><p>From 2014 onwards, the NPPR is no longer charged, but outstanding
liabilities and payments will still be collected. Read more in <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/News/MainBody,36873,en.htm">this

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lc307e">If you have not paid the NPPR</h2>

<p><strong>Up to 31 August 2014</strong></p>

<p>If you were due to pay the NPPR on a property in any (or all) of the years
2009 to 2013 and had not paid the charge due, you accumulated late fees and
penalties. If you were liable for the full period and had not paid anything,
you owed a <strong>total of €4,220</strong> on the property.</p>

<p>These late fees ceased to accumulate after 1 March 2014 and the totals due
were frozen for a ‘grace period’, starting on 2 March 2014 and ending on 31
August 2014. During this grace period, no new late penalties applied to
existing NPPR liabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Since 31 August 2014</strong></p>

<p>If you did not pay your liabilities in full by 31 August 2014, or agree
settlement terms by that deadline, you will now incur additional penalties. If
you were liable for the full period, you will owe a <strong>total of
€7,230</strong> when these penalties are applied.</p>

<p>There will not be any further increase after 1 September 2014.</p>

<p>Any outstanding amount of unpaid NPPR and penalties will remain as a charge
on the property for 12 years from the date they fell due.</p>

<p>All charges must be cleared before the property can be transferred.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0030/sec0007.html#sec7">Section
7 of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009</a> provides that if the property
is sold without paying off outstanding charges, the new owner could be liable
for the outstanding charges. Any such liability would end 12 years after the
charge was due.</p>

<p>See <a href="new_local_authority_charges_on_residential_property.en.html#l62fd2">Rates</a>
below for more details of the basic rate, late fees and penalties.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l8198f">Who was liable to pay the NPPR?</h2>

<p>If you owned residential property on the liability date in any of the years
2009 to 2013, and it was not your only or main residence on that date, you were
liable to pay the charge of €200. The first liability date was 31 July 2009.
For each year from 2010 to 2013, the liability date was 31 March.</p>

<p>There were some exemptions to the charge, for example, for mobile homes,
caravans or granny flats - see <a href="new_local_authority_charges_on_residential_property.en.html#laa057">Exemptions
from the NPPR</a> below. </p>

<p>The charge applied to all residential property that you owned on the
liability date, except for your main home. The onus was on you, the homeowner,
to come forward and pay the charge to the local authority in the area in which
the property is located. For example, if your main residence was in Dublin and
you had a holiday home in Wexford, you pay the charge to the local authority in
Wexford. </p>

<p>In summary, you paid the NPPR if:</p>
<ul><li>You owned more than one home</li>
  <li>You owned only one home and it was not your principal private residence
    (for example, your main residence was in rented accommodation)</li>
  <li>You lived abroad and owned residential property in Ireland</li>
</ul><p>You did not pay the NPPR if:</p>
<ul><li>You owned only one home and it was your principal private residence</li>
  <li>You were <a shape="rect" href="rent_a_room_scheme.html">renting out a
    room in your home</a> and qualified for tax relief for renting this
  room</li>
</ul><p>Detailed information is available in <a href="https://www.nppr.ie/Faq.aspx">Frequently Asked Questions</a> form on

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="laa057">Exemptions from the NPPR</h2>

<p>There were several exemptions to the NPPR charge. The main ones were as
follows:</p>

<p><strong>Additional family accommodation</strong></p>

<p>If you had a second property, you were not liable for the charge if the
person living in it was not paying rent and if:</p>
<ul><li>They were related to you or to your spouse </li>
  <li>They were a <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/wards_of_court.html">ward of court</a> and had
    been placed in your care </li>
  <li>You were their legal guardian. </li>
</ul><p>The property must be within 2 kilometres of your home or be a self-contained
residence on the same property as your main residence, such as a granny flat or
annexe.</p>

<p><strong>Exclusive right of residence</strong></p>

<p>If someone has an exclusive right of residence (free of rent) in a dwelling,
this means that (a) the owner does not have the right to live in the property
and (b) the occupier has the right to live there on their own. Exclusive rights
of residence usually come about as a result of inheritance or a similar legal
process.</p>

<p>So, if someone has an exclusive right of residence in a property that you
own, you do not meet the definition of 'owner' in the Act, and the property is
exempt until the person who benefits from the right of residence dies, or the
right is extinguished in some other way.</p>

<p><strong>Moving to a nursing home</strong></p>

<p>If you left your main home and moved to a nursing home, you were not liable
for the charge, as long as you did not own the home that you moved into.</p>

<p><strong>Moving home</strong></p>

<p>There was a limited exemption if you were moving home and, in the process,
owned 2 properties for a relatively short period.</p>

<p>The charge had to be paid if you owned a second property on the liability
date (31 July 2009 and 31 March each year from 2010 to 2013) even where this
had been acquired as part of the process of moving house. However, if you moved
from the first property (your main residence) into the second property not
later than 6 months after the liability date, you could get a refund of the
charge as long as you no longer owned the first property.</p>

<p>In order to get a refund, contact your local authority.</p>

<p><strong>Separation and divorce</strong></p>

<p>There was an exemption for people who may have an interest in a second
property as a result of judicial separation or divorce.</p>

<p>If you were divorced or had been granted a judicial separation, you were not
liable to pay the charge if you were living in what used to be the family home
as your main residence. If your spouse or ex-spouse did not reside in the
original family home, they were not liable for the charge, if they retained an
interest what used to be the family home as a result of divorce or a judicial
separation.</p>

<p><strong>Charities and discretionary trusts</strong></p>

<p>Residential properties owned by charities and by certain discretionary
trusts were exempt from the charge.</p>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p><strong>Up to 31 August 2014</strong></p>

<p>The NPPR charge was €200 for each property that you owned on the liability
date each year, apart from your main residence - with a handling fee of €10
for charges paid over the counter at local authority offices.</p>

<p>The charge was due to be paid by 30 September in 2009 and by 30 June in each
of the years 2010 to 2013. For each annual charge that remained unpaid after
the due date, a late fee of €20 was charged for each month (or part of a
month) from the due date onwards. These late fees ceased to accumulate after 1
March 2014 and the totals due were frozen for the grace period of 2 March 2014
to 31 August 2014.</p>

<p>If you were liable to pay the NPPR on a property for the full period and had
not paid anything to date, you owed a <strong>total of
</strong><strong>€4,220</strong> on the property during the grace period.</p>

<p><strong>Since 31 August 2014</strong></p>

<p>If you had not fully paid or agreed settlement terms by 31 August 2014, an
additional late payment fee of €120 per liability date will have been applied
on 1 September 2014, and your entire NPPR liability will also have been
increased by a factor of 50%. There will not be any further increase after 1
September 2014.</p>

<p>If you were liable for the full period and did not pay (or agree terms) by
the 31 August deadline, you will owe a <strong>total of €7,230</strong> on
the property when these penalties have been applied.</p>

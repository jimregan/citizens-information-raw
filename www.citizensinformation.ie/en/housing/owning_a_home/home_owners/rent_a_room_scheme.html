<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you rent out a room (or rooms) in your home to private tenants, the
rental income you earn will be exempt from income tax, provided this income
does not exceed a certain limit in a tax year. This is called the
<em>rent-a-room relief</em>. A self-contained unit, such as a basement flat or
a converted garage attached to your home, can qualify for this relief.</p>

<p>While renting out a room that is part of your home is not covered by
landlord and tenant law, renting out a self-contained unit is covered – see
‘Your rights and obligations’ below.</p>

<p>Depending on their circumstances, your tenant(s) may qualify for the Housing
Assistance Payment (HAP) – read more in ‘Housing Assistance Payment’
below.Your tenant(s) may be entitled to claim tax relief on rent paid – see
details in our document on <a href="../../renting_a_home/tax_relief_for_tenants.html">Tax issues for
tenants</a>. In certain circumstances, a tenant can claim <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a>. </p>

<p>Read more about rent-a-room relief in <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it70.html">A Revenue guide to
rental income (IT 70)</a> and in <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/about/foi/s16/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-07/07-01-32.pdf?download=true">this

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>For you to qualify for rent-a room relief, your home must be located in the
State and you must occupy it as your sole residence during the year of
assessment. This means that it is your home for the greater part of the year
and is where people would normally expect to make contact with you. You do not
have to own the property – you could be a tenant and be sub-letting to
someone else. (In such cases, you would have to check with your own landlord
that sub-letting is allowed – see our document on <a href="../../renting_a_home/tenants_rights_and_obligations.html">tenants’
rights and obligations</a>.)</p>

<p>The relief applies only to residential tenancies, not to short-term guest
arrangements. The occupants must be using the room on a long-term basis. For
example, renting a room to a student for the academic year or for a one-month
course is covered, but taking in guests for short breaks is not. (If you
normally rent out the room for the academic year and you rent it out for short
breaks during the summer as well, you must identify the income you get from the
short rentals, separately from the income that qualifies for rent-a-room
relief, when making your tax return to Revenue.)</p>

<p>For 2017, the total (gross) rent that you get, which includes sums that the
tenant pays for food, utilities, laundry or similar goods and services, cannot
exceed €14,000 in the tax year (1 January to 31 December) – see
‘Exclusions from rent-a-room relief’ below. </p>

<p>You cannot deduct expenses from your rental income while claiming
rent-a-room relief. However, depending on the circumstances, it may be worth
your while to opt out of the relief in a particular year in order to offset
expenses against the rental income and avail of wear and tear allowances –
see 'How to apply' below.</p>

<p>If you qualify for rent-a-room relief, the income you get from renting out
the room is not liable to PRSI, the <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">Universal
Social Charge</a> or income tax. However, <span>it must be included on your
annual income tax return</span>. </p>

<p>Rent-a-room relief will not affect your <a shape="rect" href="../buying_a_home/mortgage_interest_relief.html">mortgage interest
relief</a> or your exemption from <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/capital_taxes/capital_gains_tax.html">Capital Gains
Tax (CGT)</a> if you sell your home. </p>

<p><strong>Exclusions from rent-a-room relief</strong></p>

<p>You will not qualify for the relief if:</p>
<ul><li>Your gross income from rent and related services is over €14,000. In
    this case, Revenue will treat your rental income minus allowable expenses
    as part of your total income for tax purposes and should be included in
    your tax return. </li>
  <li>You are renting the room in your home to your son or daughter (but there
    is no restriction in the case of other family members)</li>
  <li>You are an employee or office-holder in a company, and the company pays
    you to allow clients to use the room in your home on an occasional
  basis</li>
  <li>You are renting the room to short-term guests</li>
</ul><h3>Effect of rental income on social welfare payments</h3>

<p>If you are getting a means-tested <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/social_assistance_in_ireland.html">social
assistance payment</a> from the Department of Social Protection, any rental
income you get will be assessed as means and may affect your payment. </p>

<p>However, rental income will not be assessed as means if:</p>
<ul><li>You are getting a <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/older_and_retired_people/state_pension_non_contributory.html">State
    Pension (Non-Contributory)</a> or a <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/death_related_benefits/widows_non_contrib_pen.html">Widow's/Widower's
    or Surviving Civil Partner’s (Non-Contributory) Pension</a> </li>
</ul><p><strong>and</strong> </p>
<ul><li>You would be living alone unless you rented out a room in your home. </li>
</ul><h3>Housing Assistance Payment</h3>

<p>If your tenant is applying for the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), you
will need to provide certain information to the local authority, which
administers the HAP and will pay you directly. This information includes:</p>
<ul><li>The amount of the monthly rent</li>
  <li>Your bank account payment details</li>
  <li>An undertaking regarding the property’s compliance with standards for
    rental accommodation</li>
  <li>An undertaking regarding your tax compliance</li>
</ul><p>The local authority will inspect the property within 8 months of the first
HAP payment, to ensure that it meets the minimum physical standards for rental
accommodation.</p>

<p>You have up to 5 months to produce a <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/tax-clearance.html">tax clearance
certificate</a> to the local authority.</p>

<p>Read more in <a href="../../renting_a_home/housing_assistance_payment.html">our document on
HAP</a> and in the <a href="http://hap.ie/uploads/files/pdf/landlord-booklet-english.pdf">landlord
information booklet (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l193c5">Your rights and obligations</h2>

<h3>Self-contained units</h3>

<p>If you rent out a self-contained unit in your home, such as a converted
garage attached to your home or a basement flat, the <a href="../../renting_a_home/landlords_rights_and_obligations.html">rights and
obligations</a> under residential tenancies legislation apply to you. For
example, you are obliged to <a href="../../renting_a_home/registering_a_tenancy.html">register the
tenancy</a> with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), provide a <a shape="rect" href="../../renting_a_home/rent_books.html">rent book</a> to the
tenant and ensure that the accommodation provided meets <a shape="rect" href="../../renting_a_home/repairs_maintenance_and_minimum_physical_standards.html">minimum
physical standards</a>. </p>

<p>The residential tenancies legislation provides for security of tenure for
tenants. These provisions are in <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/enacted/en/print">Part 4
of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004</a>. However, if the self-contained flat
or apartment was originally part of the main house, you can choose to opt out
of these provisions. This option is available under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/section/25/enacted/en/html#sec25">Section
25 of the Act</a>. You must give the tenant notice in writing, before the start
of the tenancy, if you wish to take this option.</p>

<h3>Rooms that are not self-contained</h3>

<p>If the part of your home that you rent out is not self-contained, you are
not covered by landlord and tenant legislation, so the rights and obligations
under that legislation do not apply to you. For example, you are not obliged to
register as a landlord with the RTB, provide a rent book to the tenant or
ensure that the accommodation provided meets any minimum physical standards.
</p>

<p>This also means that private tenants living in your home are living under a
<em>licensee agreement</em><span>, not</span> a <em>tenancy agreement,</em> and
are really only entitled to <em>reasonable notice</em> if you choose to
terminate the agreement. Tenants are, however, entitled to refer disputes to
the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/small_claims_court.html">Small
Claims Court</a>. </p>

<p>Common claims that are heard by the Small Claims Court include disputes
about retention of a tenant's deposit for what they consider unfair reasons, or
deductions from rent for damage to property that is over and above normal 'wear
and tear'. </p>

<p>Your tenants can find out more about their rights in our document <a href="../../renting_a_home/sharing_accommodation_with_your_landlord.html">Sharing
accommodation with your landlord</a> and can also contact Threshold for
advice– see 'Where to apply' below.</p>

<p><strong>Agreement with your tenant</strong></p>

<p>Before you arrange to rent out a room in your home, it is <span>strongly
recommended</span> that you and the tenant agree some ground rules and put them
in writing. If you and your tenant each sign and keep a copy of this agreement,
you can both refer to its terms in the event of confusion or disagreement.
These ground rules might include: </p>
<ul><li>How long is the tenancy going to last?</li>
  <li>How much notice will you or your tenant have to give if either of you
    chooses to end the tenancy?</li>
  <li>How much rent will the tenant pay and how often (for example, weekly,
    monthly)?</li>
  <li>How will this rent be paid (cash, cheque, standing order etc.)?</li>
  <li>When will the rent be reviewed and how much notice will you give the
    tenant of a rent review?</li>
  <li>How are utility bills (such as electricity, gas, phone, broadband, TV,
    waste charges) to be divided between you and the tenant?</li>
  <li>Can the tenant have visitors to stay overnight?</li>
  <li>Are there any restrictions regarding noise levels? </li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Rental income from renting a room in your home (and related services) is
exempt from tax, up to a maximum limit of €14,000. This limit was €12,000
in 2016 and 2015. It was €10,000 in 2014 and previous years.</p>

<p>Where more than one person is entitled to benefit from the rent (for
example, you and your spouse), this limit is divided between the individuals
concerned.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you make an annual tax return, you should record your rental income for
rent-a-room relief in the ‘Exempt income’ section of your <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/tax-return-forms.html">tax return
form</a> at the end of the tax year and return the completed form to <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/contact/index.html">your local tax office</a>.
The tax office can answer any queries you may have and will help if you have
any difficulties completing the form.</p>

<p>If you do not make an annual tax return and your income from rent and
related services is under the exemption limit, you do not have to claim
rent-a-room relief as it will apply automatically.</p>

<p>If you wish to opt out of the rent-a-room relief in a particular tax year,
you must notify Revenue in writing, on or before the return filing date for
that tax year. If you make an annual tax return, you opt out by marking the
relevant box in the ‘Exempt Income’ section of the return – otherwise
write to your tax district to say that you do not wish the relief to apply for
that year. Read more <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/about/foi/s16/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-07/07-01-32.pdf?download=true">in

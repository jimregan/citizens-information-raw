<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>A registration and inspection regime was introduced in 2012 for domestic
waste water treatment systems, such as septic tanks. The regime aims to protect
ground and surface <a href="../../../environment/water_services/water_quality.html">water
quality</a> from the risks posed by systems that are not working properly. It
was introduced under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0002/index.html">Water
Services (Amendment) Act 2012</a> and a related <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/si/0223.html">set of
Regulations</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Registration</h3>

<p>If you have a septic tank or similar system, you must register its details
with your local authority and pay a registration fee. You will have to
re-register after 5 years but you will not have to pay a fee for the second or
subsequent registrations.</p>

<p>The general deadline for registration was 1 February 2013, but you can still
register if you have not yet done so - see 'How to apply' below. If you
registered an existing system after the deadline, <strong>you will not be
eligible for any grant</strong> if your system is found to need remedial work -
see ‘Grants for remedial work' below.</p>

<p>New systems must be registered within 90 days of being connected.
Replacements of previously registered systems do not have to be registered
separately. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.epa.ie/water/wastewater/info/#.UsbMdomYbhk">Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA)</a> is responsible for developing <a href="http://epa.ie/water/wastewater/nip/">national inspection plans</a> and
reporting on their implementation. </p>

<h3>Maintenance</h3>

<p>If you have a domestic waste water treatment system, you need to:</p>
<ul><li>Know where your septic tank is located</li>
</ul><ul><li>Operate and maintain the system so it is fit for purpose and fully
    operational</li>
</ul><ul><li>Ensure that the system cannot pollute the environment by discharging or
    leaking waste anywhere it is not supposed to, that is, into the ground or
    any water source</li>
</ul><ul><li>Ensure that roof water or surface water run-off cannot enter a domestic
    waste water treatment system</li>
</ul><ul><li>De-sludge the system at intervals appropriate to the tank capacity and
    the number of people resident in the premises connected to it, or as
    recommended by the system’s manufacturer. De-sludging should be carried
    out by an authorised contractor. You should keep the receipt from the
    contractor for 5 years.</li>
</ul><p>The leaflets <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Environment/Water/FileDownLoad,33591,en.pdf">What
you need to know about your septic tank (pdf)</a> and <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Environment/Water/FileDownLoad,33589,en.pdf">Is
your well at risk from your septic tank? (pdf)</a> provide useful
information.</p>

<h3>Inspections</h3>

<p>Local authorities arrange for inspections to be carried out. The inspectors
are appointed and approved by the EPA. They have to carry identification and
show it to householders on request.</p>

<p>Inspections started in 2013. They concentrate on areas with high risk to the
environment and public health – where drinking water sources or habitats are
at risk from waste water discharges. They are also being carried out in areas
of lower risk, but at a lower rate. Your local authority will notify you if
your system is to be inspected.</p>

<p>If the inspector finds that your system is working properly and being
maintained correctly, you need take no extra action. Otherwise you will get an
advisory notice from the local authority, requiring you to improve the
maintenance of your system or to upgrade or remediate it. Any remediation work
required will be based on factors such as the nature of the problem, the extent
of risk to public health or the environment, existing site size and the
hydrological and geological conditions present.</p>

<p>You can read more about <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Environment/Water/FileDownLoad,33590,en.pdf">What
to expect from a septic tank inspection (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Grants for remedial work</h3>

<p>If you need to carry out this type of work, you may be able to get a <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2013/si/222/made/en/print">grant to
help with the cost of the work required</a>. The grant is means-tested. In
order to be eligible, <strong>you must have registered by 1 February
2013</strong> and you must have received an advisory notice from the local
authority requiring you to have the work done. Routine maintenance work does
<strong>not</strong> qualify for a grant.</p>

<p>See 'Rates' below for the income thresholds and grant rates. There is
further detailed information about the grant on the application form, including
a checklist of the documents required.</p>

<h3>Standards</h3>

<p>If you have a septic tank or similar domestic waste water treatment system,
you already have a duty of care (under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/act/pub/0030/index.html">Water
Services Act 2007</a>) to ensure that your treatment system does not cause a
risk to human health or the environment or create a nuisance through odours.
The 2012 Act adds to the existing duty of care provisions.</p>

<p>The EPA’s 2009 <a href="http://epa.ie/downloads/advice/water/wastewater/code%20of%20practice%20for%20single%20houses/#d.en.27964">Code
of Practice on waste water treatment systems for single houses</a> sets out the
most up-to-date standards. However, these are not being applied to older
systems. The 2012 Regulations define performance standards, including
maintenance and de-sludging requirements. </p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The once-off registration fee is €50. </p>

<p>There is no inspection charge.</p>

<p>The costs of any remediation will depend on the extent and nature of the
work required.</p>

<p>The income thresholds and grant rates for assistance with remedial works are
shown in the following table:</p>

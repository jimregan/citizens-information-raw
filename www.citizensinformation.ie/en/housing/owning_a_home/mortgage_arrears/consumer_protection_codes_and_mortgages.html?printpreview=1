<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Lending institutions such as banks and building societies are bound by two
statutory codes of conduct in relation to mortgages. These are the Central
Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) and its Consumer Protection
Code 2012. </p>

<p>Local authorities operate under similar rules. For people having difficulty
repaying local authority loans, two pieces of legislation, along with a set of
guidelines, provide for the local authority to make arrangements to deal with
the situation - (see ‘Local authority loans’ below).</p>

<p>If you are having <a href="overview_of_mortgage_debt.html">difficulties
paying your mortgage</a>, you should talk to the lending institution as soon as
possible. Your lender must take certain steps to deal with any problems you
have in paying your mortgage. <a href="../../losing_your_home/home_repossession.html">Repossessing your
home</a> should be the lender's last resort.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l6ce63">Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears
(CCMA)</h2>

<p>The current version of the Central Bank’s <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/publicinformation/Documents/2013%20CCMA.pdf">Code
of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA)</a> came into effect on 1 July 2013. This
is the main code of relevance to people whose mortgage is in arrears or in
danger of slipping into arrears.</p>

<p>The CCMA requires mortgage lenders to adopt specific procedures when dealing
with borrowers experiencing arrears and financial difficulties. Such procedures
must be aimed at helping you as far as possible in your own particular
circumstances.</p>

<p>In general, the CCMA requires lenders to wait 8 months before taking legal
action about mortgages in arrears. However, this requirement does not apply if
a borrower is deliberately not co-operating with the lender - see below.</p>

<p>Regardless of how long it takes your lender to assess your case, and
provided that you are co-operating, you must be given 3 months’ notice before
they can commence legal proceedings where either:</p>
<ul><li>Your lender does not offer you an <a href="alternative_repayment_arrangements.html">alternative repayment
    arrangement</a> for your mortgage</li>
</ul><ul><li>You do not accept an alternative repayment arrangement offered to you</li>
</ul><p>This will give you time to consider other options, such as voluntary
surrender, voluntary sale or a <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_arrangements.html">Personal
Insolvency Arrangement</a>.</p>

<h3>Not co-operating</h3>

<p>You may be classified as not co-operating with your lender if you:</p>
<ul><li>Do not fully and honestly disclose significant information or</li>
  <li>Fail to provide relevant information within a reasonable time or</li>
  <li>Are in arrears for 3 months, during which you either failed to contact
    the lender or respond to its communications, or your response is
    insufficient for a complete assessment of your circumstances or</li>
  <li>Have entered an alternative repayment arrangement and 3 months have
    passed, during which you have not fully made the alternative repayments
  or</li>
  <li>Have not entered an alternative repayment arrangement and 3 months have
    passed, during which you have not fully paid your mortgage or have not
    cleared your arrears</li>
</ul><p>Before classifying you as not co-operating, the lender must write to you,
giving you 20 business days to take specific actions to enable it to assess
your circumstances. It must warn you about the implications of not co-operating
and suggest that you seek appropriate advice. It must also highlight the
position about debt outstanding after repossession or sale.</p>

<p>If you are classified as not co-operating, you lose the protections of the
MARP and your lender may commence legal proceedings immediately. Before you can
be classified as not co-operating, your lender must first write to you and warn
you that this might happen and tell you what steps you need to take to avoid
being classified as not co-operating. You may appeal the decision to classify
you as not co-operating.</p>

<p><strong>Scope of CCMA</strong></p>

<p>The CCMA applies to mortgages on <em>primary residences</em> only. It
defines primary residence to include “a residential property in this State
which is the only residential property owned by the borrower” as well as the
more common definition of “the residential property which the borrower
occupies as his/her primary residence in this State” (your main home).</p>

<p>The purpose of this wider definition is to apply the protections of the CCMA
to people who are trying to maximise their income to help pay the mortgage on
their main residence or home, whether or not they actually live in it.</p>

<p>The Code also covers borrowers in <em>pre-arrears</em>. It defines
pre-arrears as follows: "A pre-arrears case arises where the borrower contacts
the lender to inform them that he/she is in danger of going into financial
difficulties and/or is concerned about going into mortgage arrears".</p>

<p>The CCMA applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State
when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary
residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these
lenders.</p>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.finance.gov.ie/news-centre/press-releases/consumer-protection-regulation-credit-servicing-firms-act-2015">Consumer
Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015</a>, the CCMA also
applies to credit servicing firms, which are firms that manage mortgages or
other loans on behalf of unregulated entities. As a result, people whose
mortgages are transferred to unregulated entities have the same protection that
they had before the loan was sold. The wording of the CCMA was <a href="https://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/processes/consumer-protection-code/Documents/Addendum%20to%20Code%20of%20Conduct%20on%20Mortgage%20Arrears%202013.pdf">changed
by addendum (pdf)</a> in 2015 to make this clear.</p>

<p>It does not apply to credit unions or to local authorities (see ‘Local
authority loans’ below).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.finance.gov.ie/news-centre/press-releases/consumer-protection-regulation-credit-servicing-firms-act-2015">Consumer
Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015</a> provides that
people whose mortgages have been transferred to unregulated entities will have
the same protection that they had before the loan was sold.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements of CCMA</strong></p>

<p>The CCMA sets out the framework that lenders must use when dealing with
borrowers in mortgage arrears or in pre-arrears. It requires lenders to handle
all such cases sympathetically and positively, with the objective at all times
of helping people to meet their mortgage obligations.</p>

<p>Under the CCMA, lenders must have the following:</p>
<ul><li>A <strong>Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process</strong> (MARP) to be used
    when dealing with arrears and pre-arrears customers. The 4 steps for the
    MARP are: 
    <ol><li>Communication </li>
      <li>Financial information </li>
      <li>Assessment and</li>
      <li>Resolution </li>
    </ol><p><a href="mortgage_arrears_resolution_process.html">Read more about
    the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>An <strong>Arrears Support Unit</strong> (ASU) to assess arrears and
    pre-arrears cases</li>
  <li>An internal <strong>Appeals Board</strong> to consider appeals from
    borrowers in relation to ASU </li>
</ul><p><strong>Lenders must also:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Ensure that communications with borrowers are presented in a clear and
    consumer-friendly manner and that the level of communications from the
    lender, or any third party acting on its behalf, is proportionate and not
    excessive, taking into account the borrower’s circumstances</li>
  <li>Not make unnecessarily frequent communications</li>
  <li>Ensure that communications with borrowers are not aggressive,
    intimidating or harassing</li>
  <li>Ensure that borrowers are given sufficient time to complete an action
    they have committed to before follow-up communication is attempted</li>
  <li>Make an information booklet available to borrowers in arrears (or
    pre-arrears) including details on the MARP, relevant contact points for
    arrears issues and details of websites with mortgage arrears information,
    such as <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/">mabs.ie</a> and <a href="http://www.keepingyourhome.ie/en/">keepingyourhome.ie</a></li>
  <li>Provide a dedicated section on their website for borrowers who are in or
    facing financial difficulties. This section must include the above booklet
    and links to the above websites</li>
  <li>Wait at least 8 months before applying to the courts to commence legal
    action for repossession of a property (this does not apply if the borrower
    is not co-operating with the lender)</li>
</ul><p><strong>Lenders must not:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Require a borrower to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another
    mortgage type as part of an alternative arrangement offered to the borrower
    in arrears or pre-arrears, unless none of the options that would allow the
    borrower to retain the tracker interest rate are appropriate and
    sustainable for the borrower’s individual circumstances. </li>
</ul><p>If this is the case, the lender may offer the borrower an alternative
repayment arrangement which requires the borrower to change from an existing
tracker mortgage to another mortgage type provided that:</p>
<ul><li>An alternative repayment arrangement is affordable for the borrower,
  and</li>
  <li>It is a long-term sustainable solution which is consistent with Central
    Bank of Ireland policy on sustainability</li>
</ul><p>If you are not happy with the lender’s treatment of your case, or if you
feel they have not complied with the CCMA, you can complain to the lender under
the Central Bank’s Consumer Protection Code 2012 - see below.</p>

<p>If you are not happy with the outcome of an appeal or complaint, you can
refer to the <a href="../../../consumer_affairs/consumer_protection/consumer_complaints/financial_services_ombudsman.html">Financial
Services Ombudsman</a>. However, the Financial Services Ombudsman cannot pursue
complaints against the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) without the
consent of the High Court.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l27de1">Consumer Protection Code 2012</h2>

<p>The Central Bank's <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/consumer/cpc/Pages/home1.aspx">Consumer
Protection Code 2012</a> applies to the regulated activities of regulated
entities operating in the State. (These terms are explained in the <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/consumer/cpc/definitions/Pages/default.aspx">'Definitions'
chapter</a> of the Code.)</p>

<p>The Code includes requirements setting out how regulated entities must deal
with and treat consumers who are in arrears on a range of loans including
credit cards, personal loans and buy-to-let mortgages. It does not apply to
mortgages on a primary residence – these are covered by the Code of Conduct
on Mortgage Arrears, described above.</p>

<p>The Consumer Protection Code requires lenders to seek to agree an approach
that will assist a consumer in dealing with an arrears problem.</p>

<p>The Code also provides that the lender must:</p>
<ul><li>Have in place written procedures for handling arrears and make
    information available to you to assist you in dealing with arrears</li>
  <li>Where your account remains in arrears 10 business days after the arrears
    first arose, immediately contact you to find out the reason for the
  arrears</li>
  <li>Ensure that the level of contact and communications from them, or from
    any third party acting on their behalf, is proportionate and not
  excessive.</li>
</ul><p>Lenders must not:</p>
<ul><li>Initiate more than 3 unsolicited communications with you, by whatever
    means, in a calendar month, other than correspondence required by the CCMA
    or other regulatory requirements. (This limit does not include missed calls
    or engaged numbers.)</li>
</ul><p>The Consumer Protection Code 2012 replaces the original Consumer Protection
Code, which came into effect in 2007. An <a href="https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/Regulation/consumer-protection/other-codes-of-conduct/3-gns-4-2-7-add-cp-code-2012.pdf?sfvrsn=4">addendum
(pdf)</a> changed the wording of the Code in 2015 to make it clear that it also
applies to credit servicing firms, which are firms that manage loans on behalf
of unregulated entities.</p>

<p>In 2016, a <a href="https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/Regulation/consumer-protection/other-codes-of-conduct/1-gns-4-2-7-addendum-to-the-code.pdf?sfvrsn=4">second
addendum (pdf)</a> made further changes to the Code. These include increased
protections for variable rate mortgage holders, which came into effect on 1
February 2017.</p>

<p>The Central Bank has published a <a href="https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/Regulation/consumer-protection/other-codes-of-conduct/9-gns-4-2-7-code-guidance-document.pdf?sfvrsn=4">consumer

<p><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0018/sec0011.html#zza18y1992s11">Section
11 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992</a> provides that the
local authority may make such monetary arrangements with you as it considers
equitable to take account of your particular circumstances. In effect, this
means that, if you are having problems making your repayments, you should
approach the local authority to see if you can make an arrangement to
facilitate you paying over a longer term or to restructure the repayments in
some other way.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad,30943,en.pdf">Detailed
guidelines (pdf) have been issued to local authorities</a> on how to deal with
such cases. These guidelines are based on the Central Bank’s Code of Conduct
on Mortgage Arrears, described above. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2009/a2209.pdf">Housing
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009</a> provides that where you owe money to a
local authority either for rent or loan repayments and the local authority is
satisfied that you would otherwise suffer undue hardship, it may make an
arrangement with you to repay by instalments. This section (Section 34) is in
effect with respect of loan repayments since 14 June 2010 but not in respect of
rent.</p>

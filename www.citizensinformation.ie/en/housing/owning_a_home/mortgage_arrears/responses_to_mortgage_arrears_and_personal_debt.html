<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Several initiatives are under way to address the interlinked problems of
mortgage arrears and other personal debt. Many are contained in the Mortgage
Arrears Plan, described below. </p>

<p>The role of the <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/mabs_service.html">Money
Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS)</a> has been enhanced, to include a
Dedicated Mortgage Arrears service in several MABS locations and a Court Mentor
service to assist debtors faced with court proceedings. <a href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/news/2015/news20151222.html">These
services were launched in December 2015</a>.</p>

<p>MABS is also centrally involved in a new <a href="aid_and_advice_scheme.html">aid and advice scheme for people in
serious mortgage arrears</a> as part of Abhaile, the national Mortgage Arrears
Resolution Service. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.housing.gov.ie/housing/policy/launch-rebuilding-ireland-action-plan-housing-and-homelessness">Action
Plan for Housing and Homelessness</a>, published in July 2016, proposes:</p>
<ul><li>A national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service (<a href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/news/2016/news20161003.html">Abhaile,
    launched on 3 October 2016</a>)</li>
  <li>A national information campaign, targeted at people in long-term mortgage
    arrears</li>
  <li>Possible new legislation, including simplifying the personal insolvency
    system</li>
  <li>Examining the mortgage-to-rent scheme to identify possible
  improvements</li>
</ul><p>A series of reports dating back to 2010 provides the background to these and
other initiatives – see 'Further information' below.</p>

<p>In December 2016, the <a href="http://www.finance.gov.ie/what-we-do/banking-financial-services/publications/reports-research/report-mortgage-arrears-2016">Department
of Finance published a detailed Report on Mortgage Arrears</a>, prepared for it
by the Central Bank of Ireland.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l81a0e">Mortgage Arrears Plan </h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.merrionstreet.ie/en/News-Room/Releases/government-statement-resolving-the-mortgage-arrears-crisis.html">Mortgage
Arrears Plan</a> was announced in March 2013. Its main points are summarised as
follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Performance targets for banks:</strong> The Central Bank required
    the 6 main banks to <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/press-area/press-releases/Documents/Approach%20to%20Mortage%20Arrears%20Resolution%20-.pdf">propose
    sustainable solutions for a percentage of arrears accounts (pdf)</a> by
    specified dates. It continued to set these rolling <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/press-area/press-releases%5CPages%5CMortgageArrearsResolutionTargetsJune2014.aspx">Mortgage
    Arrears Resolution Targets</a>, requiring the banks to meet them on a
    quarterly basis. In April 2015, following an assessment of its supervisory
    engagement, <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/press-area/press-releases/Pages/UpdateonCentralBankssupervisoryengagementonmortgagearrears.aspx">it
    issued revised requirements to the banks</a>. </li>
  <li><strong>Review of Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears</strong>: A revised
    Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears came into effect in July 2013 - see
    below.</li>
  <li><strong>Insolvency Service of Ireland:</strong> The <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/insolvency_service_of_ireland.html">Insolvency
    Service of Ireland (ISI)</a> was established by the Personal Insolvency Act
    2012 and plays a key role in the operation of <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_options.html">personal
    insolvency solutions</a> – see below.</li>
  <li><strong>Mortgage-to-rent and mortgage-to-lease arrangements:
    </strong>There is a national <a href="mortgage_to_rent_scheme.html">mortgage-to-rent scheme</a> for
    private mortgages and a <a href="http://www.environ.ie/housing/home-ownership/schemeservice/local-authority-mortgage-rent-lamtr-scheme">mortgage-to-rent
    scheme for local authorities</a>. The measures announced in May 2015
    include an expansion of the national mortgage-to-rent scheme. </li>
  <li><strong>Advice and guidance:</strong> The Mortgage Arrears Information
    and Advice Service is described below. In September 2015, <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pressoffice/Pages/pr010915.aspx">details
    were announced of a greater role for MABS</a> in offering information,
    advice and assistance to borrowers in arrears.</li>
  <li><strong>Legislation on repossessions:</strong> The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/act/pub/0030/index.html">Land
    and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013</a>, which became law in July 2013,
    enabled repossessions to be started again.</li>
  <li><strong>Monitoring and review:</strong> The Central Bank is <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/industry-sectors/credit-institutions/Documents/Internal%20Guideline%20-%20Sustainable%20Mortgage%20Arrears%20Solutions.pdf">monitoring
    banks closely (pdf)</a> to ensure that they make progress on dealing with
    distressed mortgages as set out in the performance targets outlined above.

<h1 class="topic base_rates_title">Mortgage Arrears Plan - detail</h1> --><h3>Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA)</h3>

<p>The Central Bank’s statutory <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/processes/consumer-protection-code/Documents/2013%20CCMA.pdf">Code
of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (pdf)</a> sets out the framework that lenders
must use when dealing with borrowers who are in mortgage arrears or at risk of
falling into arrears. The original version of the CCMA came into effect in
February 2010. A substantially revised version was introduced in January 2011,
following the report of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt
– see 'Further information' below. After a further review, a revised CCMA
came into effect in July 2013.</p>

<p>In June 2015, the Central Bank reported on a <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/press-area/press-releases/Pages/CentralBanksthemedinspectionidentifiesweaknessesinlenderscompliancewiththeCodeofConductonMortgageArrears.aspx">themed
inspection of compliance with the CCMA</a>.</p>

<h3>Personal insolvency legislation </h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0044/index.html">Personal
Insolvency Act 2012</a> introduced the following 3 debt resolution processes,
subject to conditions in each case: </p>
<ul><li>A <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/debt_relief_notices.html">Debt
    Relief Notice</a> to allow for the write-off of qualifying debt up to
    €20,000 (later increased to €35,000) subject to a 3-year supervision
    period</li>
  <li>A <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/debt_settlement_arrangements.html">Debt
    Settlement Arrangement</a> for the agreed settlement of unsecured debt over
    5 years</li>
  <li>A <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_arrangements.html">Personal
    Insolvency Arrangement</a> for the agreed settlement of secured debt up to
    €3 million (though this cap can be increased with the consent of all
    secured creditors) and unsecured debt over 6 years</li>
</ul><p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/32/enacted/en/html">Personal
Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015</a> provided for <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR15000598">court review of proposed
Personal Insolvency Arrangements</a>; increased the threshold for Debt Relief
Notices from €20,000 to €35,000; and strengthened the regulatory powers of
the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI). </p>

<h3>Bankruptcy</h3>

<p>The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 revised the rules on bankruptcy. Several <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/New_Bankruptcy_Rules_PR">changes to
the bankruptcy laws</a> came into effect in December 2013. The <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=30407&amp;&amp;CatID=59">Bankruptcy
(Amendment) Act 2015</a> made further changes. Read more in <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/what_is_bankruptcy.html">our
document on bankruptcy</a>. </p>

<h3>Mortgage Arrears Information and Advice Service</h3>

<p>The Mortgage Arrears Information and Advice Service was launched in
September 2012 to assist people with mortgage difficulties. It consists of:</p>
<ul><li>A Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline - now operated by MABS (0761 07
    2000)</li>
  <li>Enhancements to <a href="http://www.keepingyourhome.ie/">keepingyourhome.ie</a></li>
  <li>Availability of financial advice for people being offered long-term
    restructuring proposals by the banks - see below</li>
</ul><strong>Financial advice:</strong> If you are at an advanced stage in the <a href="mortgage_arrears_resolution_process.html">Mortgage Arrears Resolution
Process (MARP)</a>, you can consult a practising accountant for advice on the
implications of forbearance options proposed by your lender. Your lender will
pay for this consultation. 

<p>You can select an accountant from a panel drawn from members of recognised
accountancy bodies, including the Institute of Chartered Accountants Ireland,
the Association of Certified Chartered Accountants, the Institute of Certified
Public Accountants and the Institute of Incorporated Public Accountants. You
can find out more about this in the <a href="http://www.keepingyourhome.ie/Mortgage_Financial_Advice_Service_Protocol.pdf">protocol
document (pdf)</a> on the keepingyourhome.ie website, where you can also find a
<a href="http://www.keepingyourhome.ie/mortgage_arrears_information_and_advice_service/index.html#sec6">list
of participating accountants</a>. </p>

<p>(A separate panel of accountants is being established under the new Mortgage
Arrears Resolution Service, to provide free financial advice under the <a href="aid_and_advice_scheme.html">Scheme of Aid and Advice for borrowers in
home mortgage arrears</a>.) </p>

<h3>Central Credit Register</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.finance.gov.ie/news-centre/press-releases/credit-reporting-act-2013">Credit
Reporting Act 2013</a> provides for the establishment and operation of a
statutory <a href="https://www.centralbank.ie/consumer/Pages/ccr.aspx">Central
Credit Register (CCR)</a> system. Credit providers will be required to report a
comprehensive range of credit information. They will be obliged to check with
the Register for all applications for credit above €2,000 in value. Consumers
will be entitled to get one free copy of their record every 12 months.</p>

<p>The initial phase of the Central Credit Register will focus on lending to
consumers. The first enquiries by lenders against the CCR data are expected to
start after December 2017.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lff436">Other responses</h2>

<p>As well as the major initiatives outlined above, significant changes
include:</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/si/0321.html">Social
Housing (Assessment) (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations 2011</a> allow for a
borrower whose mortgage has been deemed unsustainable under the MARP to be
assessed for social housing.</p>

<p><a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/housing_taxes_and_reliefs/deferring_local_property_tax.html">Arrangements
for deferral</a> of Local Property Tax (LPT) are provided for people in
mortgage distress and also for people who are in a <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/debt_settlement_arrangements.html">Debt
Settlement Arrangement</a> or a <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_arrangements.html">Personal
Insolvency Arrangement</a>.</p>

<p>In 2013 the Central Bank <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/publications/Documents/Mortgage%20Arrears%20in%20Ireland%20Introducing%20the%20Enhanced%20Quarterly%20Statistics.pdf">revised
(pdf)</a> its system for publishing <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/polstats/stats/mortgagearrears/Pages/releases.aspx">mortgage
arrears data</a> to include buy-to-let arrears and aiming to enable easier
tracking than before of the various alternative options on offer to borrowers.
</p>

<p>The Department of Finance publishes <a href="http://finance.gov.ie/what-we-do/banking-financial-services/mortgage-creditdebit/mortgage-arrears-reports/mortgage-4">monthly
reports</a> on mortgage arrears and restructures for the 6 main lenders covered
by the Central Bank’s Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets. These figures
relate to mortgages on primary residences only. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.mortgageholders.ie/">Irish Mortgage Holders
Organisation (IMHO)</a> has arrangements with 2 banking organisations – <a href="https://www.mortgageholders.ie/aib-ebs-haven">AIB Group</a> and <a href="https://www.mortgageholders.ie/kbc">KBC Bank</a> – whereby customers
can contact IMHO for direct assistance (free of charge) in dealing with these
banks about their mortgage arrears. These arrangements are funded by the banks
but operate independently of them.</p>

<p>The Central Bank’s <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/press-area/press-releases/Pages/CentralBankAnnouncesPilotSchemeforConsumerMulti-DebtRestructuring.aspx">framework
for restructuring of distressed consumer debt across multiple lenders</a> was
implemented during 2013 on a pilot basis and a <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/press-area/press-releases/Documents/Pilot%20of%20the%20Multiple-Debt%20Framework%20Report.pdf">review
of its outcomes (pdf)</a> was published in April 2014.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.finance.gov.ie/news-centre/press-releases/consumer-protection-regulation-credit-servicing-firms-act-2015">Consumer
Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015</a> provides that
people whose mortgages have been transferred to unregulated entities will have
the same protection that they had before the loan was sold. The Central Bank's
<a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/consumer/cpc/Pages/home1.aspx">Consumer
Protection Code 2012</a> was updated in 2015 by an <a href="https://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/processes/consumer-protection-code/Documents/Addendum%20to%20Consumer%20Protection%20Code%202012.pdf">addendum
(pdf)</a> to make it clear that the Code now applies to credit servicing firms,
which are firms that manage loans on behalf of unregulated entities.</p>

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Central Bank's <a href="https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/Regulation/consumer-protection/other-codes-of-conduct/24-gns-4-2-7-2013-ccma.pdf?sfvrsn=4">Code
of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) (pdf)</a> sets out the framework that
lenders must use when dealing with borrowers in mortgage arrears or in
pre-arrears. It requires lenders to handle all such cases sympathetically and
positively, with the objective at all times of helping people to meet their
mortgage obligations.</p>

<p>Under the CCMA, lenders must operate a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process
(MARP) when dealing with arrears and pre-arrears customers. The CCMA was
revised in 2013 and now contains a detailed definition of what constitutes 'not
co-operating' with the lender and strong provisions on what happens if you are
declared 'not co-operating' – which can include immediate commencement of
repossession proceedings.</p>

<p>The 4 steps of the MARP are covered in detail below. They are:
communication; financial information; assessment; and resolution. There is also
an appeals process under the CCMA, but this is outside the MARP. If these steps
have been exhausted and the lender intends to repossess your home, they must
then adhere to the CCMA rules governing repossession proceedings – see
‘Repossession’ below.</p>

<h3>Personal Insolvency Arrangements and MARP</h3>

<p>Under the <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_options.html">personal
insolvency system</a>, people applying for a <a href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_arrangements.html">Personal
Insolvency Arrangement</a> must declare that they have co-operated with their
mortgage lender under the MARP for at least 6 months and have been unable to
agree an alternative repayment arrangement. </p>

<h3>Getting help from MABS</h3>

<p>The <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/mabs_service.html">Money
Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS)</a> can help you to work through the steps
of the MARP. It has a Dedicated Mortgage Arrears service in over 20 locations
and a court mentor service, in collaboration with the <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/insolvency_service_of_ireland.html">Insolvency
Service of Ireland (ISI)</a>, to assist debtors faced with court proceedings.
<a href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/news/2015/news20151222.html">Read
more about these services</a>.</p>

<p>MABS is also centrally involved in a new <a href="aid_and_advice_scheme.html">aid and advice scheme for people in
serious mortgage arrears</a>, as part of <a href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/news/2016/news20161003.html">Abhaile,
the national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l07a3d">Communication</h2>

<p>A mortgage arrears problem arises as soon as you fail to make a full
mortgage repayment or only make a partial mortgage repayment on the date it is
due.</p>

<p>If the arrears remain outstanding 31 days from this date, the lender must
inform you in writing of the status of the mortgage account. This letter must
include full details of the payment(s) missed and the total amount now in
arrears. It must also explain that your arrears are now being dealt with under
the MARP; the importance of co-operating with the lender; the consequences of
non-cooperation; and the impact of missed repayments or repossession on your <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/credit_ratings.html">credit
rating</a>.</p>

<p>The lender must also send you an information booklet including details on
the MARP, relevant contact points for arrears issues and details of websites
with mortgage arrears information, such as <a href="http://www.mabs.ie/">mabs.ie</a> and <a href="http://www.keepingyourhome.ie/">keepingyourhome.ie</a>. (You must also
get this if you are in pre-arrears.)</p>

<p>For as long as you are in arrears, the lender must give you a written update
of the status of your account every 3 months.</p>

<p>If an <a href="alternative_repayment_arrangements.html">alternative
repayment arrangement</a> has not been set up, and you miss a third repayment
(full or partial), the lender must tell you the following in writing:</p>
<ul><li>The potential for legal proceedings and loss of your property, and an
    estimate of the costs to you of such proceedings</li>
  <li>The importance of taking independent advice from <a href="http://www.mabs.ie">MABS</a> or an appropriate alternative</li>
  <li>That even if your property is sold, you will remain liable for any
    outstanding debt, including any accrued interest, charges, legal, selling
    and other related costs.</li>
</ul><h4>Level of communication</h4>

<p>Under the CCMA, each lender’s Board must agree a communications policy,
which ensures that the level of communications with borrowers is proportionate
and not excessive; communications are not aggressive, intimidating or
harassing; borrowers get enough time to complete agreed actions (with help if
needed) before any further communication; and steps are taken to agree future
communications. Communications must not be unnecessarily frequent.</p>

<p>The lender may make an unsolicited visit to your home only if other attempts
to contact you have failed and you are about to be classified as not
co-operating. You must get at least 5 business days’ notice and you can opt
to meet in the lender’s office instead. You can choose to have a third party
with you. The lender’s letter announcing the visit must explain the
implications of not co-operating.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lc955a">Financial information, assessment</h2>

<h4>Financial information</h4>

<p>Lenders must provide a standard financial statement to obtain financial
information from a borrower in arrears or in pre-arrears, so that they can
assess your financial position and identify the best course of action. The
Central Bank has developed an <a href="https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/Regulation/consumer-protection/other-codes-of-conduct/36-gns-4-2-7-financial-statement.pdf?sfvrsn=4">industry
standard format (pdf)</a> for the standard financial statement (SFS). All
lenders must use this SFS. The Central Bank has a <a href="https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/Regulation/consumer-protection/other-codes-of-conduct/35-gns-4-2-7-mortgage-arrears---sfs.pdf?sfvrsn=4">consumer
guide (pdf)</a> to completing an SFS. </p>

<p>When providing the financial statement, the lender must ensure that you
understand the MARP process. It must offer to help you to complete the SFS and
mention sources of independent advice, such as MABS. It must give you enough
time to assemble the information and complete the SFS, and must give you a copy
of the completed statement.</p>

<p>You may be required to provide supporting documentation to verify the
information in the SFS.</p>

<h4>Assessment</h4>

<p>The lender must pass the completed SFS to its Arrears Support Unit (ASU) for
assessment.</p>

<p>The lender’s ASU must assess the completed SFS in a timely manner and
examine your case on its individual merits. The ASU must base its assessment of
your case on your full circumstances. These include your personal
circumstances; overall indebtedness; information provided in the standard
financial statement; current repayment capacity; and previous payment
history.</p>

<p>Before completing the assessment, it may agree a temporary alternative
repayment arrangement if a delay would make your situation worse. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lb5a4b">Resolution</h2>

<p>When the assessment is complete, the lender must explore all options for <a href="alternative_repayment_arrangements.html">alternative repayment
arrangements</a>.</p>

<p>These options may include:</p>
<ul><li>Paying interest only, or interest and part of the capital, for a period
  </li>
  <li>Permanently or temporarily reducing the interest rate </li>
  <li>Deferring repayments (or part) for a period </li>
  <li>Extending the mortgage term </li>
  <li>Changing the type of mortgage </li>
  <li>Adding arrears and interest to the principal </li>
  <li>Equity participation (reduction of principal, with transfer of part of
    your equity) </li>
  <li>Warehousing part of the mortgage (including through a split mortgage)
  </li>
  <li>Reducing the principal </li>
  <li>A "deferred interest" or other voluntary scheme</li>
</ul><p>The lender may require you to change from an existing tracker mortgage to
another mortgage type if it concludes that none of the options that include
keeping your tracker are appropriate or sustainable for you. It may offer you
an alternative arrangement that requires you to change from your tracker
mortgage if you can afford the alternative arrangement and it is
sustainable.</p>

<h4>Information and advice on alternative arrangements</h4>

<p>When the lender is offering an alternative repayment arrangement, they must
give you a clear written explanation of the arrangement. As well as the basic
details of the new repayment amount and the term of the arrangement, the lender
must explain its impact on the mortgage term, the balance outstanding and the
existing arrears, if any.</p>

<p>The lender must also give details of: how interest will be applied to your
mortgage loan account as a result of the arrangement; how the arrangement will
be reported to the Irish Credit Bureau and the impact of this on your <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/credit_ratings.html">credit
rating</a>; and information on your right to appeal the lender’s decision,
including how to submit an appeal.</p>

<p>The lender must also advise you to take appropriate independent legal and/or
financial advice.</p>

<h3>Mortgage Arrears Information and Advice Service</h3>

<p>As part of the <a href="http://www.keepingyourhome.ie/mortgage_arrears_information_and_advice_service/index.html">Mortgage
Arrears Information and Advice Service</a>, your participating lender will pay
€250 for a consultation with an accountant of your choice drawn from a panel
composed of members of recognised accountancy bodies including the Institute of
Chartered Accountants Ireland, the Association of Certified Chartered
Accountants, the Institute of Incorporated Public Accountants and the Institute
of Certified Public Accountants. You can find out more about this in the <a href="http://www.keepingyourhome.ie/Mortgage_Financial_Advice_Service_Protocol.pdf">protocol
document (pdf)</a> on keepingyourhome.ie, along with a <a href="http://www.keepingyourhome.ie/mortgage_arrears_information_and_advice_service/index.html#sec6">list
of participating accountants</a>. (A separate panel of accountants is being
established to provide free financial advice under the <a href="aid_and_advice_scheme.html">Abhaile scheme</a>.) </p>

<p><strong>If an alternative arrangement is agreed</strong></p>

<p>The lender must monitor the arrangement on an ongoing basis and formally
review its appropriateness for you at least every 6 months. This review must
include checking with you whether your circumstances have changed since the
start of the arrangement or since the last review.</p>

<p>If you cease to adhere to the terms of an alternative repayment arrangement,
the lender’s Arrears Support Unit (ASU) must formally review your case,
including the Standard Financial Statement, immediately.</p>

<p><strong>If an alternative arrangement is not agreed</strong></p>

<p>It may not be possible for you and your lender to agree on an alternative
repayment arrangement. If the lender is not willing to offer you an alternative
repayment arrangement, they must give the reasons in writing. If they do offer
an arrangement, you may choose not to accept it.</p>

<p>In both of these cases, the lender must inform you in writing about other
options, including voluntary surrender, trading down or voluntary sale, and the
implications for you of each option. They must also inform you that you are now
outside the MARP, and that repossession proceedings can follow after 3 months
– see 'Repossession proceedings' below. </p>

<p>The lender must also tell you what happens about any debt outstanding after
repossession or sale. It must tell you about <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_options.html">personal
insolvency options</a>; the importance of taking independent advice; and your
right to appeal or complain. </p>

<h4>Mortgage-to-rent option</h4>

<p>If you have worked through the MARP with your lender and agree that you can
no longer afford to pay your mortgage loan now or in the future, the lender may
approve you for the <a href="mortgage_to_rent_scheme.html">national
mortgage-to-rent scheme</a>, depending on your circumstances. Under this
scheme, people who cannot pay their mortgage can switch from owning their home
to renting their home as social tenants of a housing association, which buys
the home from the lender. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l12fa2">Appeals and complaints</h2>

<p>Under the revised CCMA effective from July 2013, the appeals process is now
separate from the MARP. However, if you are refused an alternative repayment
arrangement, or you reject the arrangement being offered, you must get 3 months
before the lender can start repossession proceedings – see 'Repossession
proceedings' below. Even though you are now outside the MARP, you can appeal
the decision to the lender’s Appeals Board under the CCMA if: </p>
<ul><li>You are not willing to accept the alternative repayment arrangement being
    offered </li>
  <li>You are not offered an alternative arrangement </li>
  <li>You are classified as not co-operating</li>
</ul><p>The lender must allow you a reasonable period to consider submitting an
appeal. This must be at least 20 business days from the date you receive
notification of the ASU’s decision.</p>

<p>The Appeals Board will be made up of 3 of the lender’s senior personnel
who have not yet been involved in your case. At least one member of the Appeals
Board must be independent of the management team and must not be involved in
lending matters.</p>

<p>There must be a written procedure for handling appeals, to include:</p>
<ul><li>Only written appeals will be considered</li>
  <li>Appeals will be acknowledged in writing within 5 business days of being
    received</li>
  <li>The lender must give you the name of one or more people who will be your
    point of contact in relation to the complaint until the Appeals Board has
    ruled on it</li>
</ul><p>The appeal must be decided within 40 business days of being received. The
lender must write to you within 5 business days of this, to convey the decision
of the Appeals Board and explain the terms of any offer being made. The lender
must also inform you of your right to refer the matter to the <a href="http://www.financialombudsman.ie/">Financial Services Ombudsman</a> and
must give you the Ombudsman’s contact details.</p>

<p>The lender must give you written updates on the progress of the appeal at
least every 20 business days. </p>

<h4>Complaints</h4>

<p>If you are not happy with the lender’s treatment of your case, or if you
feel they have not complied with the CCMA, you can complain to the lender under
<a href="https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/Regulation/consumer-protection/other-codes-of-conduct/4-gns-4-2-7-cp-code-2012.pdf?sfvrsn=4">the
Central Bank’s Consumer Protection Code</a>.</p>

<p>If you are not happy with the outcome of an appeal or complaint, you can
refer to the <a href="http://www.financialombudsman.ie/">Financial Services
Ombudsman</a>. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic further_info">
<h2 class="further_info" id="l2fe6a">Repossession proceedings</h2>

<p>The lender must not apply to the courts to commence legal action for
repossession of your property until every reasonable effort has been made to
agree an alternative arrangement and a specified time period has elapsed. </p>

<p>In general, if you are co-operating with the lender, they must wait at least
8 months from the date your arrears were classified as a MARP case - see
'Communication' above - before applying to the courts.</p>

<p>This 8-month period does not apply if you do not co-operate with the lender;
or if you perpetrate a fraud on the lender; or if there is a breach of contract
by you other than the existence of arrears - in such cases, repossession
proceedings can be started immediately. However, before you can be classified
as not co-operating, your lender must first write to you and warn you that this
might happen and tell you what steps you need to take to avoid being classified
as not co-operating.</p>

<p>For co-operating borrowers, if your lender does not offer you an alternative
repayment arrangement, or if you do not accept an alternative repayment
arrangement being offered, your lender must write to you as outlined in
'Resolution' above. As regards repossession, this letter must state:</p>
<ul><li>That you are now outside the MARP, and that its protections no longer
    apply</li>
  <li>That legal proceedings may start 3 months from the date that the letter
    is issued or 8 months from the date the arrears arose, whichever date is
    later</li>
</ul><p>The 3 months will give you time to consider other options, such as voluntary
surrender, <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/downloads/publications/16_10_13_Selling_your_house_to_pay_off_your_mortgage.pdf">voluntary
sale (pdf)</a> or a <a href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_arrangements.html">Personal
Insolvency Arrangement</a>. You can also appeal the lender’s decision under
the CCMA’s appeals process, described above.</p>

<p>The lender or its legal advisers must notify you in writing immediately
before applying to the Courts to start any legal action on repossession. Read
more in the <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/downloads/publications/16_10_13_Facing_Repossession.pdf">MABS
factsheet on facing repossession (pdf)</a>. </p>

<p>Even at this late stage, you may be able to access <a href="aid_and_advice_scheme.html">free legal aid and advice</a> to help with
your situation. There is also a <a href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/news/2015/news20151222.html">national
network of court mentors</a>, which offers support and advice for borrowers on
court proceedings, as well as direct referral back to MABS. </p>

<p>Your property may be repossessed either by voluntary agreement or by court
order - see <a href="/en/housing/losing_your_home/home_repossession.html">our
document on repossession</a>. Even if court proceedings are started, the lender
must still try to maintain contact with you to seek an agreement on repayments,
and must put legal proceedings on hold if agreement is reached.</p>

<p>The lender must explain to you that, if the property is sold and the sale
price does not cover the amount you owe, you are still liable for the rest of
the amount you owe.</p>

<p>If your property is repossessed and sold, the lender must write to you
promptly with the following information:</p>
<ul><li>Balance outstanding on your mortgage loan account</li>
  <li>Details and amount of any costs arising from the disposal which have been
    added to the account</li>
  <li>Interest rate to be charged on the remaining balance</li>
</ul></div>

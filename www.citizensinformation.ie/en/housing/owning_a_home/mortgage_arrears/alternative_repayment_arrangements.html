<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are having difficulty <a href="../help_with_buying_a_home/paying_for_a_home.html">paying your
mortgage</a>, your lender may offer you an <em>alternative repayment
arrangement</em> - often called a <em>mortgage restructure</em>. This document
is concerned with a mortgage on your home (your primary residence) – not a
buy-to-let property. It outlines some of the alternative repayment arrangements
that may be offered to you and issues that you should consider. The
arrangements available from your lender may be part of the <a href="mortgage_arrears_resolution_process.html">Mortgage Arrears Resolution
Process (MARP)</a> or outside it. They may vary as the market continues to
evolve and change.</p>

<p>Every case is different and your lender is obliged to look carefully at your
personal circumstances before deciding what option to offer you. Having
assessed your financial situation, your lender will have chosen an alternative
repayment arrangement that it considers appropriate and sustainable for your
circumstances.</p>

<p>However, it is important that you also think carefully about the offer and
whether it is sustainable in the long term from your point of view. You will be
signing a new mortgage contract and will be bound by its terms for the duration
of the agreement. Make sure that you fully understand the details of the offer.
You can use the <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/jargon-buster/">MABS jargon

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l06c98">Considering the offer</h2>

<p>You need to look at 2 things in particular – affordability and
sustainability. As part of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) you
will have completed a <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/consumer/info/documents/industry%20standard%20financial%20statement.pdf">Standard
Financial Statement (pdf)</a> for your lender. You can use this to review your
income and outgoings.</p>

<h3>Affordability</h3>

<p>When assessing whether you can afford the proposed repayments, things you
should consider include:</p>
<ul><li>Your current net monthly income</li>
  <li>All your current monthly outgoings</li>
  <li>The net disposable income that you will have left to pay the mortgage</li>
  <li>How much your assets are worth</li>
  <li>Any other debts you may have</li>
  <li>If the alternative repayment arrangement offered is a short-term one,
    whether you will be able to pay the higher repayments when the arrangement
    ends</li>
</ul><p><strong>Tools to help you</strong></p>
<ul><li>Most lenders have family finance budgeting tools on their websites</li>
  <li>Consumerhelp.ie has several useful <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/budgeting-calculators">budgeting
    calculators</a></li>
  <li>Mabs.ie also has a <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/budgeting-tool/">budgeting tool</a></li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/RLE_calculated">Insolvency Service
    of Ireland (ISI) calculator of reasonable living expenses</a> may also be
    useful</li>
  <li>The ISI’s website <a href="http://backontrack.ie/">backontrack.ie</a>
    has information for people in financial difficulty</li>
</ul><h3>Sustainability</h3>

<p>To assess whether you can keep up payments for the remaining term of the
mortgage, you need to consider what may change in your personal situation and
whether future external changes may affect your ability to repay. While it may
be difficult to forecast far into the future, you can assess, for example, what
level of interest rate increase you could cope with.</p>

<p>Things to consider include:</p>
<ul><li>Your current and future income.</li>
  <li>Your current and future expenditure.</li>
  <li>Your age and stage in life. For example, your dependants may need
    childcare now or may need support going to college in the future.</li>
  <li>Future interest rates and the future value of your assets.</li>
  <li>The possibility of inheritances or other lump sums in the future.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Tools to help you</strong></p>

<p>Consumerhelp.ie has a <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/rate-change-calculator">rate change

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l2b715">Alternative repayment arrangements </h2>

<p>Each lender may offer slightly different alternative repayment arrangements,
so this is a general guide. The Central Bank's <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/press-area/press-releases/Pages/CentralBankannouncesnewregulationsonresidentialmortgagelending.aspx">lending
limits on mortgages</a> do not apply to the restructuring of mortgages.</p>

<p>In general you cannot be asked to change from an existing tracker mortgage
to another mortgage type, unless the lender has considered all of the options
it offers and has concluded that none of the options that would allow you to
keep the tracker interest rate are appropriate and sustainable for your
circumstances. If this is the case, your lender may offer you an arrangement
that requires you to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another
mortgage type. Your lender can only do this if the new arrangement is
affordable for you and is sustainable over the long term.</p>

<p>Some arrangements are short-term – this means that they have a specific
duration that will expire at some point in the future – for example a 6-month
interest-only arrangement. Others are long-term – for example, extending the
term of the mortgage. Some lenders may approve a trial arrangement before
finalising the proposal. In some cases, the proposal will amend the terms of
your original contract, in effect creating a new contract. In other cases, you
may be asked to enter into a completely new contract with your lender.</p>

<table border="1" style="width: 100%"><col><tbody><tr><td><p>If you are being offered an alternative repayment arrangement
        under the <a href="mortgage_arrears_resolution_process.html">Mortgage Arrears
        Resolution Process (MARP)</a> you must always get:</p>
        <ul><li>A clear written explanation of how the alternative repayment
            arrangement works</li>
          <li>The proposed new repayment amount</li>

        </ul><p>You must also be told to get independent advice on the proposal. As

        Arrears Information and Advice Service</a>, your lender will pay €250
        for a consultation with an accountant of your choice. You can find <a href="http://www.keepingyourhome.ie/mortgage_arrears_information_and_advice_service/index.html#sec6">a

      </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<p>Some examples of alternative repayment arrangements that your lender may
offer include the following:</p>

<h3>Temporary deferral of payment</h3>

<p>This is usually a short-term arrangement to ease immediate financial
pressure. It is also called a <em>payment break</em> or a
<em>moratorium</em>.</p>

<h3>Move to an interest-only mortgage or change the way you pay interest</h3>

<p>This means that you will only pay the interest due on your loan during a
certain period, and not the capital amount due. You may be offered an
interest-only option for under or over a year.</p>

<p>In some cases, you may be offered a less than interest-only arrangement for
a short period, as interest-only repayments may not be affordable when your
situation is assessed. The difference between this lower amount and the
interest-only repayment amount may be added on to your outstanding mortgage
balance when the alternative repayment arrangement expires.</p>

<p>You may also be offered a fixed repayment option, where you pay more than
just the interest, but less than your full capital and interest repayment, for
a fixed period. This means that you pay interest and some capital towards your
mortgage.</p>

<p>All of these short-term alternative repayment arrangements are only suitable
if you think that you will be able to return to meeting your full capital and
interest repayments in the near future.</p>

<p>Some things to consider include:</p>
<ul><li>When the interest-only period ends, your lender will recalculate your
    mortgage repayments based on the remaining term and the outstanding
    mortgage balance. This means that your repayments will increase, as you now
    have a shorter term to pay back the outstanding mortgage balance.</li>
  <li>If you are offered a long term interest-only option, you may need to sell
    your property to pay the outstanding mortgage balance when the mortgage
    term expires.</li>
</ul><h3>Extending the term of the mortgage</h3>

<p>This means that your term is extended, so you pay less each month (because
you have spread the repayments over a longer period of time). It is important
to note that your <em>cost of credit</em> will increase, as it will take you
longer to clear your mortgage in full. Cost of credit is the difference between
the amount that you borrow and the total amount that you will repay, including
interest.</p>

<p>Some things to consider include:</p>
<ul><li>What age will you be when the mortgage expires?</li>
  <li>Do you have a compulsory retirement age, or can you continue to work
    beyond retirement age?</li>
  <li>If you retire before the mortgage has been paid off, will your pension or
    other income allow you to continue to pay the mortgage?</li>
  <li>Are you clear on the implications of the revised term? While you may be
    paying less each month, your cost of credit will increase over the extended
    mortgage term.</li>
</ul><h3>Capitalising arrears and interest</h3>

<p>This alternative repayment arrangement adds the arrears on to the
outstanding mortgage balance. The increased mortgage balance is then paid over
the remaining term of the mortgage. This may increase your monthly payments.
This arrangement may be combined with a term extension so that your monthly
payments are less.</p>

<h3>Split mortgages</h3>

<p>If you are not able to service your current mortgage payments, but your
circumstances may improve in the future, you may be offered a <em>split
mortgage</em>. The main aim of a split mortgage is to allow you to stay in your
family home. A split mortgage arrangement splits the mortgage into 2 parts. You
make agreed repayments on the first part of the mortgage and the second part is
<em>warehoused</em> or set aside to be paid at a later date. Some lenders may
write off part of the warehoused loan, some add interest to the warehoused part
of the mortgage and others do not.</p>

<p>Some things to consider include:</p>
<ul><li>What percentage of any lump sum you may receive in the future must be
    paid towards the warehoused loan (for example, if you get an inheritance or
    a bonus)?</li>
  <li>What happens when the loan reaches maturity – do you have to sell the
    property to repay the outstanding mortgage balance? Or will you keep a
    right of tenure, where the outstanding debt will only be recovered after
    your death?</li>
</ul><h3>Reduction in the capital amount</h3>

<p>Your bank may agree to reduce the overall amount outstanding on your
mortgage.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l56b4c">Other options </h2>

<p>If your lender does not offer you an alternative repayment arrangement, or
if you cannot agree on one being offered, you may need to consider other
options. Your lender must inform you in writing about the options that are
available to you. These may include voluntary surrender, trading down,
mortgage-to-rent or voluntary sale. You must be informed of the implications of
each option and what will happen to any outstanding debt.</p>

<p>At this stage, you may be eligible for the new <a href="aid_and_advice_scheme.html">aid and advice scheme for people in
serious mortgage arrears</a>, being operated as part of <a href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/news/2016/news20161003.html">Abhaile,
the national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service</a>. </p>
<ul><li><strong>Voluntary surrender of the property</strong> 
    <p>You surrender the property to your lender. If there is a shortfall (the
    property sells for less than the outstanding mortgage balance) you remain
    liable for this and you will need to agree a repayment arrangement with
    your lender to deal with the shortfall.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Trade-down mortgages</strong> 
    <p>You may be able to sell your property and buy a new property of a lower
    value. It may be possible to add negative equity to the loan and secure it
    on the new property.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Mortgage to rent</strong> 
    <p>Under the national <a href="mortgage_to_rent_scheme.html">mortgage-to-rent scheme</a>, people
    who are having trouble paying their mortgages to private lenders can switch
    from owning their home to renting their home as social tenants. If you take
    up the mortgage-to-rent option, you will no longer own your home or have
    any financial interest in it.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Voluntary sale of the property</strong> 
    <p>You sell the property yourself. If there is a shortfall (the property
    sells for less than the outstanding mortgage balance) you remain liable for
    this and you will need to agree a repayment arrangement with your lender to
    deal with the shortfall.</p>
  </li>
</ul><p>Your lender must also inform you in writing that you are now outside the
MARP, and that repossession proceedings can follow either 3 months from the
date the letter is issued or 8 months from the date your arrears arose,
whichever date is later. You must be told about <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_options.html">personal
insolvency options,</a> the importance of taking independent advice and your
right to <a href="mortgage_arrears_resolution_process.html">appeal or
complain</a>.</p>

<p>You can read <a href="mortgage_arrears_resolution_process.html">our
document on the MARP</a> to get more detailed information on what happens if an
alternative repayment arrangement is not agreed or if you break an alternative
repayment arrangement.</p>

<p>Remember that, if you and your lender cannot come to an agreement on
modifying or restructuring your mortgage, you can also consider a <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_arrangements.html">Personal
Insolvency Arrangement (PIA)</a>. Under a PIA all of your debts, including your
mortgage, are assessed and an agreed plan is made to repay your creditors. A
PIA will need to be approved at a creditors’ meeting (by a qualified majority
of creditors). You also can get more information on this option from <a href="http://backontrack.ie/">backontrack.ie</a>. </p>

<p>If you are in very serious financial difficulties, <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/what_is_bankruptcy.html">bankruptcy</a>
may also be an option.</p>

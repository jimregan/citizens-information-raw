<div class="topic">

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are in serious mortgage arrears on your home, if you are unable to
pay your debts, and if your mortgage lender has begun to take legal action, you
may be able to access the <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/en/abhaile">Abhaile scheme</a> for borrowers in home
mortgage arrears. This scheme provides a range of services to help you to deal
with your situation, including financial advice, legal advice and insolvency
advice. </p>

<p>Abhaile is coordinated by the <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/home">Department of Justice and
Equality</a> and the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/home.aspx">Department of Social
Protection</a> and is operated by the <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/">Money
Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS)</a> in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/Home">Insolvency Service of Ireland
(ISI)</a>, the <a href="http://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/">Legal Aid Board</a>
and the <a href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/">Citizens
Information Board</a>.</p>

<p>Panels of qualified and regulated professionals have been set up to provide
services under the Scheme. MABS also has a network of Dedicated Mortgage
Arrears (DMA) advisers to provide independent expert advice to people in
difficulty with mortgage arrears.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="ld4178">Who is eligible?</h2>

<p>You will be eligible for advice and assistance under the Scheme if:</p>
<ul><li>You are insolvent – this means that you are unable to pay your debts in
    full as they fall due and</li>
  <li>You are in mortgage arrears on your home and</li>
  <li>You are at risk of losing your home (for example, if your mortgage lender
    has initiated repossession proceedings or indicated that they plan to do
    so; if they have said that they consider you to be non-cooperating; or if
    they have asked you to consider selling or surrendering your home)</li>
</ul><p>However, even if the above conditions are satisfied, you will not be
eligible for the Scheme if your home is disproportionate to your reasonable
living accommodation needs, as set out at <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2012/act/44/section/104/enacted/en/html#sec104">section
104 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012</a>.</p>

<p>If your mortgage arrears relate only to a buy-to-let property, you are not
covered by the Scheme. However, if you are in mortgage arrears on your home,
and you also own a buy-to-let, you will still be eligible if you satisfy the
above conditions.</p>

<p>You are eligible for the Personal Insolvency Court Review Service under the
Scheme (see below) if you are insolvent and in mortgage arrears and your
creditors have rejected your proposal for a <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_arrangements.html">Personal
Insolvency Arrangement (PIA)</a> that included your home.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="ld6975">What services are provided?</h2>

<p>There are 5 separate advice and assistance services available under the
Scheme, as follows:</p>

<h3>Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) service</h3>

<p>A <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Aid_and_Advice_PIP_Panel.pdf/Files/Aid_and_Advice_PIP_Panel.pdf">panel
of Personal Insolvency Practitioners (pdf)</a> has been set up under the
Scheme. If you wish to explore your <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_options.html">options
under personal insolvency</a>, MABS can give you a voucher for free advice and
help from one of these PIPs. You can choose your PIP from the Scheme panel,
subject to availability.</p>

<p>The voucher will entitle you to a face-to-face consultation with a PIP. The
PIP will carry out a full assessment of your financial situation, explain all
the available options and the best option for you to deal with your mortgage
arrears, and confirm that advice to you in writing. The PIP will also prepare a
Prescribed Financial Statement (PFS) with you. This is a detailed written
analysis of your financial situation, as required under the personal insolvency
legislation.</p>

<p>If the PIP advises that your best option is personal insolvency, they will
help you in taking the next steps. If they advise that your best option is <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/what_is_bankruptcy.html">bankruptcy</a>,
they will also provide you with the certificate required by the bankruptcy
court, confirming that you have been advised regarding your options under
personal insolvency.</p>

<h3>Accountant service</h3>

<p>If your case involves complicated financial issues, but is not suited to
personal insolvency, MABS can give you a voucher for free financial advice from
an accountant under the Scheme. A new accountancy panel is being set up,
listing accountants who participate in the Scheme. You can choose your
accountant from this panel, subject to availability.</p>

<p>You will first need to work with a MABS adviser to complete the Standard
Financial Statement (SFS) that lenders require under the <a href="mortgage_arrears_resolution_process.html">Mortgage Arrears Resolution
Process (MARP)</a>. The accountant will need a copy of this statement in order
to give you financial advice.</p>

<p>The voucher will entitle you to a face-to-face consultation with the panel
accountant. The accountant will advise you on any financial issues relating to
resolution of your mortgage arrears and advise you on possible solutions, and
will confirm that advice to you in writing.</p>

<h3>Consultation solicitor service</h3>

<p>After you have completed your Prescribed Financial Statement or Standard
Financial Statement and received financial advice under the Scheme, your
financial adviser (PIP, MABS adviser or accountant) may recommend that you also
consult a solicitor if your case raises legal issues. For example, your
mortgage lender may have written to you, seeking repossession of your home or
proposing that you surrender it.</p>

<p>Your financial adviser can apply to MABS for a legal advice voucher on your
behalf. You can then choose a solicitor from the panel that has been set up
under the Scheme (subject to availability).</p>

<p>The legal advice voucher will entitle you to a face-to-face consultation
with a solicitor. The consultation solicitor will assess and explain your legal
position, and will advise you on any repossession proceedings and on any legal
issues relating to your mortgage arrears. The solicitor will also confirm that
legal advice to you in writing. If the lender has already issued repossession
proceedings, the consultation solicitor may, in certain circumstances, be able
to negotiate on your behalf to settle the proceedings out of court.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the solicitor will need to see any documents
that are relevant in your case, particularly your up-to-date financial
statement and any written financial advice that you have received under the
Scheme.</p>

<h3>Duty solicitor service</h3>

<p>If you are facing Circuit Court repossession proceedings, you may be able to
get some help at Court from the duty solicitor. This is a solicitor from the
Scheme’s solicitor panel (see above) who is normally on duty at a Circuit
Court on repossession hearing dates. You cannot choose the duty solicitor, as
the Legal Aid Board assigns solicitors from the panel to attend on particular
dates.</p>

<p>The duty solicitor service is a limited service to provide advice and help
to unrepresented borrowers at court. Your consultation solicitor will explain
this in more detail.</p>

<p>Normally, you should already have obtained written financial and legal
advice under the Scheme, including advice from the consultation solicitor on
any repossession proceedings.</p>

<p>If you have not applied in time to get such advice, the duty solicitor may
still be able to give you some more limited help, but only if you have already
applied to MABS. <strong>If your mortgage lender has already issued
repossession proceedings against your home, and you have not yet applied for
the Scheme, you should contact MABS as soon as possible – see ‘Where to
apply’ below.</strong></p>

<p>The duty solicitor may be able to speak for you in Court, to explain what
steps you are taking to try and deal with your mortgage arrears, and may be
able to apply for the proceedings to be adjourned if you are trying to put a
solution in place. They may also be able to explain to you what is happening in
the proceedings.</p>

<p>However, they may be helping several Scheme borrowers in court on that day,
so you should attend well in advance of the time shown on the Court papers, and
you should ask for MABS when you arrive. (MABS advisers also attend at the
Circuit Court on repossession hearing dates, to provide information and
support. However, they cannot give legal advice or speak for you in Court.)</p>

<p>The duty solicitor cannot act as your legal aid solicitor or defend the
repossession proceedings on your behalf. This Scheme does not cover legal aid
for defending repossession proceedings. If you have a valid legal defence to
the repossession and want to <a href="../../../justice/legal_aid_and_advice/civil_legal_advice_and_legal_aid.html">apply
for legal aid</a>, you should apply for that to the Legal Aid Board, separately
from this Scheme.</p>

<h3>Personal insolvency court review service</h3>

<p>If you have already worked with a PIP and have proposed a <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_arrangements.html">Personal
Insolvency Arrangement (PIA)</a> to your creditors, but the creditors have
refused your proposal, you can ask the Courts to review it.</p>

<p>Under this element of the Aid and Advice Scheme, the Legal Aid Board can
provide you with legal representation by a solicitor and barrister in seeking a
Court review of your PIA proposal. If the Court agrees that the proposal is
overall fair and reasonable, using the criteria set out in <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/32/section/21/enacted/en/html#sec21">section
115A of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012</a>, it can impose the proposal on
your creditors.</p>

<p>Your PIP will apply to the Legal Aid Board for legal representation on your
behalf. The PIP must certify to the Board that you have reasonable grounds for
seeking the court review and that you satisfy the other conditions for review
laid down by the <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/en_act_2012_0044.PDF">Personal
Insolvency Acts 2012 to 2015 (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>If the Legal Aid Board is satisfied with the application, it will grant you
a Legal Aid Certificate. You and your PIP can then select a solicitor from the
Scheme solicitors’ panel to act on your behalf. (Under the Personal
Insolvency Acts, it is your PIP who must apply to Court on your behalf for the
review.) The Legal Aid Board will normally also cover the cost of a barrister
from the Civil Legal Aid barristers’ panel.</p>

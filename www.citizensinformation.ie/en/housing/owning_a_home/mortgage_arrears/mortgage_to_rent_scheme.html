<p>Under the <a href="http://www.housingagency.ie/Housing-Information/Mortgage-to-Rent-Scheme">national
mortgage-to-rent scheme</a>, people who are having trouble paying their
mortgage to a private lender can switch from owning their home to renting their
home as social tenants of a housing association, which buys the home from the
lender.</p>

<p>If you take up the mortgage-to-rent option, you will no longer own your home
or have any financial interest in it.</p>

<h3>Changes in 2017</h3>

<p>Following a review of the mortgage-to-rent scheme, several changes were
announced in February 2017. Some of these changes took effect immediately and
some are due to take effect later in 2017. The changes include:</p>
<ul><li>Flexibility about the size of properties that can qualify - allowing for
    up to 2 bedrooms above the household’s needs (Q1 2017)</li>
  <li>Increased price thresholds for properties (immediate)</li>
  <li>Borrowers will now apply to the local authority for social housing
    support before submitting their application for the mortgage-to-rent scheme
    (Q1 2017)</li>
  <li>If the lender considers that the borrower is not suitable for the scheme,
    they will have to tell the borrower in writing why they are not considered
    suitable (immediate)</li>
</ul><p>The review also proposed an alternative funding model for the scheme. A
number of pilot projects will be initiated during 2017 with lenders, local
authorities and investors who are interested in engaging in a long-term lease
arrangement.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The national mortgage-to-rent scheme is for people whose mortgage is with a
private lender. There is a <a href="http://www.environ.ie/housing/home-ownership/schemeservice/local-authority-mortgage-rent-lamtr-scheme">separate
mortgage-to-rent option for local authority borrowers in arrears</a>.</p>

<p>For you to qualify for the national mortgage-to-rent scheme, your mortgage,
home and household must meet detailed eligibility criteria, as follows:</p>

<h3>Your mortgage</h3>
<ul><li>You must be unable to make the repayments on your mortgage loan and your
    lender must have decided that this situation is unlikely to change in the
    future</li>
  <li>You must be engaging with your lender to try to find a solution</li>
  <li>You must have completed the <a href="mortgage_arrears_resolution_process.html">Mortgage Arrears
    Resolution Process (MARP)</a> with your lender </li>
</ul><h3>Your home</h3>
<ul><li>In general, your property must be in negative equity. However, a property
    in marginal positive equity may now be considered for inclusion in the
    scheme, if that equity is no more than 10% of the open market value, to a
    maximum of €15,000.</li>
  <li>Your property must suit your needs – you must not be over or
    under-accommodated in accordance with <a href="https://housing.ie/Our-Publications/Housing-for-People-with-a-Disability/Housing-Needs-Assessment-Guidance-notes-Revised-30.aspx">local
    authority guidelines</a>, plus one bedroom (this will increase to 2
    bedrooms, following the review of the scheme).</li>
  <li>Depending on the type and location of your property, it must not exceed a
    certain value (increased in February 2017) as set out in the following
    table:</li>
</ul><table border="1" style="width: 100%"><caption></caption>
  <col><col><col><col><tbody><tr><td><strong>Type of property</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Location</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Maximum value (from February 2017)</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Maximum value (before February 2017)</strong></td>
    </tr><tr><td>House</td>
      <td>Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Louth, Cork and Galway</td>
      <td>€365,000</td>
      <td>€350,000</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Apartment or townhouse </td>
      <td>Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Louth, Cork and Galway</td>
      <td>€310,000</td>
      <td>€300,000</td>
    </tr><tr><td>House</td>
      <td>Elsewhere in the State</td>
      <td>€280,000</td>
      <td>€250,000</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Apartment or townhouse </td>
      <td>Elsewhere in the State</td>
      <td>€210,000</td>
      <td>€190,000</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><h3>Your household</h3>
<ul><li>You must <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local_authority_and_social_housing/applying_for_local_authority_housing.html">qualify
    for social housing</a>. As part of this requirement, your net household
    income must not exceed certain limits, depending on which part of the State
    you live in and how many adults and children there are in your household.
    The income limits for different locations and households are in <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad,29414,en.pdf">this
    table (pdf)</a>. Net household income is your household income after taxes
    and social insurance have been taken off. </li>
  <li>You must not own any other property or have assets in excess of
  €20,000</li>
  <li>You must have a long-term <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad,29412,en.pdf">right
    to remain in the State (pdf)</a></li>
</ul><h3>Getting advice</h3>

<p>You must get legal and financial advice before the mortgage-to-rent process
can go ahead. </p>

<p>Your lender will pay up to €500 for legal advice. </p>

<p>If you wish, your lender will also pay €250 for you to get financial
advice from an accountant on the <a href="http://www.keepingyourhome.ie/mortgage_arrears_information_and_advice_service/index.html">Mortgage
Arrears Information and Advice Service panel</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/mabs_service.html">Money
Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS)</a> can provide debt advice, as well as
general information on the scheme.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l9ffdb">How it works</h2>

<p>Changing your status from owner to tenant of your home involves a complex
set of legal and financial arrangements, all of which must be signed off before
the transfer of property takes place.</p>

<p>When all of these arrangements have been agreed, including the purchase
price of your home (see below) you voluntarily surrender possession of your
home to your mortgage lender. The lender immediately sells your home to a
housing association, who will then rent it to you. See ‘Housing
associations’ below.</p>

<h3>Purchase price of your home</h3>

<p>Before your home can be sold to the housing association, it must be valued
independently and the lender and the housing association must agree a price.
The price will be based on several factors, including the market valuation of
the property and the cost of any necessary repairs. If the lender and the
housing association cannot agree a price, the arrangement will not go ahead.</p>

<h3>After the sale</h3>

<p>The proceeds from the sale of your home to the housing association will go
towards your mortgage debt and you come to an arrangement with your lender for
the remaining balance that you owe, if any. This remaining balance is now an
<em>unsecured</em> debt. (A <em>secured</em> debt is a loan on which goods or
property are available as security against non-payment – for example a
housing mortgage, where you offer the property as security and it may be
repossessed if you cannot pay the mortgage.)</p>

<p>You will no longer own your property but you can continue living in your
home as a social housing tenant and you will have a tenancy agreement with the
housing association. As with all sales of property since 1 January 2010, the
date of sale, price and address of your home will be placed on the <a href="http://www.propertypriceregister.ie/">Residential Property Price
Register</a>, which is published by the Property Services Regulatory
Authority.</p>

<p>If your financial situation improves, you will have an option to buy your
home back from the housing association after 5 years.</p>

<h3>Housing associations</h3>

<p>A <a href="/en/housing/local_authority_and_social_housing/housing_associations.html">housing
association</a> is a registered charity and an independent not-for-profit
organisation which has been approved to provide and manage social housing.
Housing associations aim to provide housing for those who cannot meet their
housing needs from their own resources at an affordable rent.</p>

<p>You will pay an affordable rent, based on your income. If your income
increases the rent will increase but if your income falls then the rent payment
will also reduce, in order to remain affordable.</p>

<p>In general, you must be eligible for social housing in order to become a
housing association tenant. So, as noted in ‘Rules’ above, you must qualify
for social housing in order to qualify for the mortgage-to-rent scheme. </p>

<p>The assessment of suitability for social housing is carried out by local
authorities. Your lender can provide an application form to <a href="../../local_authority_and_social_housing/applying_for_local_authority_housing.html">apply
to your local authority</a>. Following the review of the mortgage-to-rent
scheme in February 2017, borrowers will have to apply for social housing
support <strong>before</strong> submitting an application for the
mortgage-to-rent scheme.</p>

<h3>Appeals</h3>

<p>If your lender does not agree that you are suitable for the mortgage-to-rent
scheme, you can appeal to the lender’s Appeals Committee under the <a href="mortgage_arrears_resolution_process.html">Mortgage Arrears Resolution
Process (MARP)</a>.</p>

<p>If the local authority decides that you are not eligible for social housing
support (which means that you cannot access the mortgage-to-rent scheme), you
can appeal this decision through the local authority’s internal appeals
system. If you are not happy with the outcome, you can contact the <a href="../../../government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/office_of_the_ombudsman.html">Ombudsman</a>.

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>Where appropriate, your lender will offer you the opportunity to apply for
the scheme and give you an application form for mortgage-to-rent. If you are
interested, you give consent in writing to your lender to submit your details
to a number of organisations involved in the scheme.</p>

<p>You then need to complete several steps:</p>
<ol><li>You agree to surrender ownership of your home in exchange for a tenancy
    agreement with a housing association</li>
  <li>You complete your Mortgage to Rent application form and a Social Housing
    Support application form and give them to your local authority along with
    all the required documentation, including the Proposal to Consider
    Participation in the Mortgage to Rent Scheme (issued to you by your
  lender)*</li>
</ol><p>* As noted above, borrowers will shortly have to apply for social housing
support <strong>before</strong> submitting an application for the
mortgage-to-rent scheme.</p>

<p>The Housing Agency has published a <a href="http://www.housing.ie/getattachment/Housing-Information/Mortgage-to-Rent-Scheme/A-Guide-to-the-Mortgage-to-Rent-Scheme-August-2015.pdf">Guide
to the Mortgage to Rent Scheme (pdf)</a>. A new step-by-step guide will be
prepared.</p>

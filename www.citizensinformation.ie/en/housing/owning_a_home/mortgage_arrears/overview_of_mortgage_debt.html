<br><br><p>The mortgage on your house, flat or apartment is probably the biggest and
most important financial commitment that you have. When you <a href="../help_with_buying_a_home/paying_for_a_home.html">take out a
mortgage</a>, the mortgage lender gets a claim on your property. If you fall
into arrears, your lender may eventually seek to <a href="../../losing_your_home/home_repossession.html">repossess your
home</a>.</p>

<p>If you are having difficulties paying your mortgage, even if you are not
actually in arrears, but are in <em>pre-arrears</em>, you should contact your
lender’s Arrears Support Unit immediately. Delaying and allowing mortgage
arrears to build up will make the problems worse. Your lender does not want to
repossess your home. It wants you to continue making your payments –
repossession is the last resort.</p>

<p>Lending institutions such as banks are bound by <a href="consumer_protection_codes_and_mortgages.html">codes of conduct</a> in
relation to people who are in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears. Local
authorities operate under <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad,30943,en.pdf">similar
guidelines (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>In line with these codes, your lender must take certain steps to deal with
any problems you have in paying your mortgage. Under the Central Bank’s <a href="https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/Regulation/consumer-protection/other-codes-of-conduct/24-gns-4-2-7-2013-ccma.pdf?sfvrsn=4">Code
of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) (pdf)</a>, lenders must operate a <a href="mortgage_arrears_resolution_process.html">Mortgage Arrears Resolution
Process (MARP)</a> when dealing with customers in mortgage arrears and
pre-arrears.</p>

<p><strong>Other loans and debts</strong></p>

<p>Even if if you are not in mortgage arrears, or have no mortgage at all, your
home could be in danger of repossession if you have other debts. If you build
up other debts and are unable to repay them, then the people to whom you owe
money may register that debt as a 'judgment mortgage' against your home and
seek to recover their money in that way (see <a href="../../losing_your_home/home_repossession.html">our document on
repossession</a>).</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="le4232">Assistance from MABS</h2>

<p>As soon as you realise that you have a problem with mortgage arrears or
other debt, you can start taking action to deal with it. The <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/mabs_service.html">Money
Advice and Budgeting Service</a> (MABS) can help you to do this, either
face-to-face or via the MABS helpline. </p>

<p>As part of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, your mortgage lender
will ask you to document your financial situation on a <a href="https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/Regulation/consumer-protection/other-codes-of-conduct/36-gns-4-2-7-financial-statement.pdf?sfvrsn=4">Standard
Financial Statement (pdf)</a>. MABS can help you to fill out this statement.</p>

<p>In recent times, MABS has taken on a greater role in offering information,
advice and assistance to borrowers in arrears. This role includes a Dedicated
Mortgage Arrears service and a Court Mentor service for debtors faced with
court proceedings.</p>

<p>In addition, MABS is centrally involved in the <a href="aid_and_advice_scheme.html">Abhaile scheme</a> for people who are in
serious mortgage arrears and at risk of losing their home. This scheme provides
a range of services to help you to deal with your situation, including
financial advice, legal advice and insolvency advice. <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/en/abhaile/">Read more on mabs.ie</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.mabs.ie/contact-mabs/">Find your nearest MABS
office</a>, ring the helpline at 0761 07 2000 (9am - 8pm, Monday - Friday) or
email: <a href="mailto:helpline@mabs.ie">helpline@mabs.ie</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="le85cd">Other sources of information and advice </h2>

<p>Several other organisations provide information and advice to people facing
mortgage arrears and other <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/dealing_with_debt.html">problem
debt</a>.</p>

<p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission’s website has a <a href="http://www.nca.ie/nca/mortgage-arrears">set of FAQs on dealing with
mortgage arrears</a> and a <a href="http://www.nca.ie/nca/debt-action-plan">step-by-step action plan</a> for
dealing with debt in general.</p>

<p>The Free Legal Advice Centres (FLAC) have published a <a href="http://www.flac.ie/download/pdf/moving_out_of_mortgage_arrears_online_version_finaloct2013.pdf">guide
to the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013 (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>You may wish to get legal advice on your options and on what happens if the
mortgage lender takes steps to repossess your home. <a href="http://www.flac.ie/">FLAC</a> provides free legal advice from a
nationwide network of voluntary advice centres, some of which are based in <a href="http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/">Citizens Information Centres</a>.
</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../justice/legal_aid_and_advice/legal_aid_board.html">Legal Aid
Board</a> also provides legal advice, but there is a means test for this. As
part of the <a href="aid_and_advice_scheme.html">Abhaile scheme</a>
mentioned above, the Legal Aid Board operates a panel of solicitors to provide
legal aid and advice to people who are at risk of losing their home and are
referred by MABS. It also operates a “duty solicitor” service to provide
court support for insolvent borrowers in repossession proceedings. These
services are provided for free, under a voucher system.</p>

<p>Other organisations that provide advice and assistance include the <a href="https://www.mortgageholders.ie/">Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation
(IMHO)</a>, <a href="http://www.newbeginning.ie/">New Beginning</a>, <a href="http://www.phoenixproject.ie/">Phoenix Project Ireland</a> and <a href="http://www.stepchangedebtcharity.ie/">StepChange Debt Charity
Ireland</a>. IMHO has arrangements with 2 banking organisations – <a href="https://www.mortgageholders.ie/aib-ebs-haven">AIB Group</a> and <a href="https://www.mortgageholders.ie/kbc">KBC Bank</a>, whereby customers can
contact IMHO for direct assistance (free of charge) in dealing with these banks
about their mortgage arrears. </p>

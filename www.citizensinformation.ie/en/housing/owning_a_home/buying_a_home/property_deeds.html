<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>There are 2 separate systems for recording property transactions:</p>
<ul><li>The registration of title system (<em>Land Registry</em>) which provides
    a State-guaranteed title to property and </li>
  <li>The registration of deeds system (<em>Registry of Deeds</em>) which
    records the existence of deeds and conveyances affecting property</li>
</ul><p>A <em>title</em> is the ownership of a property and a <em>deed</em> is a
written document that affects property.</p>

<p>Both systems are mutually exclusive. Your <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a> will know which of the
2 systems is relevant to your case. Both systems are under the control and
management of the Property Registration Authority (PRA), an independent
statutory body set up under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2006/act/12/enacted/en/print.html">Registration
of Deeds and Title Act 2006</a>. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l51367">The Land Registry: registration of title</h2>

<p>When title or ownership is registered in the Land Registry, all relevant
details concerning the property and its ownership are entered on documents
known as <strong></strong><em>folios</em><strong>.</strong> These form the
registers maintained in the Land Registry.</p>

<p>Property that is registered at the Land Registry is known as <em>registered
land</em>, as every transaction on a property is registered on a folio. The
folio is guaranteed by the State to be a confirmed record of the title to the
property to which it refers. </p>

<p>A folio is a document that describes the property registered; refers to a
plan on the Registry maps; gives the name and address of the registered
owner(s) and describes any burdens affecting the property, for example, rights
of way or charges (mortgages). You can use the folio to find out who has the
title or ownership of a property, without having to read the original deeds.
</p>

<p>The Land Registry also maintains maps or <em>title plans</em> of property
described in the registers. These maps do not indicate whether a boundary
includes a hedge, wall, ditch etc., so the registers are therefore not
conclusive as to boundaries. Any dispute as to boundaries must be resolved by
the relevant parties - if they cannot reach agreement it is a matter for the
courts to resolve.</p>

<p>You can search for a folio or title plan on <a href="https://www.landdirect.ie/pramap.aspx/">landdirect.ie</a> or you can
inspect a plain copy of a folio in the PRA’s public offices, which costs
€5. You can also request a certified copy, which costs €40. There is more
detail in <a href="http://www.prai.ie/faqs/how-do-i-obtain-a-copy-of-a-folio-andor-map-3/">these
FAQs</a>.</p>

<p>If the property is not registered in the Land Registry it may have been
dealt with by the Registry of Deeds.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lc5729">Registration of Deeds system</h2>

<p>The Registry of Deeds was established in 1708 for the purpose of registering
and filing <em>memorials</em> of deeds or conveyances of unregistered land. </p>

<p>A memorial is a summary of the deed, giving the date, the names and
descriptions of all parties and all witnesses to the deed and a description of
the property affected by the deed. Since May 2008, memorials have been replaced
by <em>ROD application forms</em>.</p>

<p>When a deed is lodged in the Registry of Deeds it is not filed there
permanently - it is returned to the party who lodged it for registration.
Instead a ROD application form (formerly a memorial) is filed. The new signed
deed becomes the latest deed showing the ownership of the property, adding to a
chain of deeds that go back to when the property was first registered.</p>

<p>Deeds that are recorded in the Registry of Deeds have a legal priority over
unrecorded deeds and other deeds recorded later in time.</p>

<p>As the memorial or ROD application form is on public record at the Registry
of Deeds, anyone can inspect it and see who owns the property. However, a
purchaser of unregistered land must read the actual deeds to examine the title
to the property.</p>

<h3>Lost deeds<br></h3>

<p>Because the Registry of Deeds keeps a memorial or ROD application form
summarising the change of ownership or mortgage, you can get a copy of this
document to replace a lost or misplaced deed. A memorial or ROD application
form does not have the same legal effect as a deed but provides secondary
evidence of the contents of the deed. You can get a certified copy for €20
and a plain copy for €1 per page.</p>

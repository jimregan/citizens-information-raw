<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Mortgage interest relief is a tax relief based on the amount of qualifying
mortgage interest that you pay in a given tax year for your principal private
residence (your home). A tax year means the period from 1 January to 31
December.</p>

<p>Mortgages taken out after <strong>31 December 2012</strong> do not qualify
for mortgage interest relief.</p>

<h3>Budget 2017</h3>

<p>Mortgage interest relief was due to be abolished entirely after 31 December
2017. It will now be retained beyond this date, on a tapered basis. Details are
to be announced in Budget 2018.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>For you to qualify for tax relief on mortgage interest repayments, the
interest must relate to money that you have borrowed to purchase, repair or
improve your sole or main residence. For example, you cannot claim mortgage
interest relief for interest on a loan used to buy a holiday home or investment
property, but you can claim it if the loan is to extend or improve your main
home.</p>

<p>If you work and pay taxes in the UK (including Northern Ireland) but your
sole or main residence is in the State, you can claim relief on the interest
you pay on the mortgage. You will need to have a <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">Personal
Public Service Number (PPSN)</a> in order to claim the relief. </p>

<p>Relief is also subject to upper limits, which will depend on your personal
situation and whether you are a first-time buyer - see <a href="mortgage_interest_relief.en.html#l7320c">Rates and ceilings</a> for
details.</p>

<h3>Mortgage start date and entitlement to relief</h3>

<p>Your entitlement to mortgage interest relief depends on the relevant start
date, as follows:</p>
<ul><li>If you started paying the mortgage in 2003 or earlier, your entitlement
    expired in 2009.</li>
  <li>For a mortgage taken out between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2012,
    your entitlement to relief will continue until the end of 2017.</li>
  <li>Mortgages taken out after 31 December 2012 do not qualify for mortgage
    interest relief.</li>
</ul><h3>How the relief works</h3>

<p>Mortgage interest relief is administered via Tax Relief at Source (TRS).
This means that your mortgage lender gives you the benefit of tax relief on the
amount of mortgage interest paid. The lender does this by reducing your
mortgage repayment by the amount of tax relief you are entitled to in each tax
year. Any amendments to this tax relief - for example, if there is a change in
interest rates - are made automatically by your lender.</p>

<p>You do not have to be earning a taxable income to qualify for mortgage
interest relief.</p>

<p>Normally, you do not claim mortgage interest relief in an annual tax return
because it is given directly to you by your mortgage lender. Tax relief can
still be claimed from your Revenue office for interest paid on non-secured
loans used for qualifying purposes.</p>



<h3><strong>Mortgage arrears and payment of interest </strong></h3>

<p>While the legislation governing mortgage interest relief provides for
granting of relief based on the amount of qualifying interest
<strong>paid</strong> in a tax year, many lenders used to operate the relief
based on the amount of interest <strong>charged</strong> to an account, even if
the borrower did not actually pay that amount of interest. In the past, this
had little impact. </p>

<p>However, in response to the growing incidence of mortgage arrears, since
January 2014 all lenders are obliged to grant Tax Relief at Source (TRS) based
on the amount of interest actually paid by the borrower within a tax year, in
accordance with the legislation.</p>

<p>This change does not affect borrowers who make the full repayments on time,
in accordance with their mortgage loan agreement.</p>

<p>For borrowers who do not make their repayments or who pay less than the
amount of interest charged to their account, the TRS amount due is reduced to
reflect the actual amount of interest paid.</p>

<p>As regards interest-only arrangements, people who are only paying the
interest portion of their mortgage are still entitled to TRS and will continue
to get it if they meet the qualifying conditions.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l7320c">Rates and ceilings</h2>

<p>There are different rates and ceilings for mortgage interest relief,
depending on your circumstances. Revenue has published <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/tax-relief-source-mortgage-rates.html">detailed
tables</a>, which show how the various rates and ceilings are applied. You can
use these tables to calculate how much mortgage interest relief you will get
each year. </p>

<h3><strong>First-time buyers</strong></h3>

<p>You are a first-time buyer for the purposes of mortgage interest relief if
you are in the first 7 tax years of receiving it. Rates of relief for
first-time buyers are generally reduced over the lifetime of the mortgage.
However, for mortgages taken out by first-time buyers between 1 January 2004
and 31 December 2008, there is a special rate of 30% for the tax years 2012 to
2017.</p>

<h3>Rates for non-first-time buyers</h3>

<p>If you are <strong>not</strong> a first-time buyer, the rate of mortgage
interest relief is 15%.</p>

<h3>Ceilings</h3>

<p>The amount of mortgage interest on which you can get relief is subject to
upper limits or ceilings. The ceiling that applies to you depends on your
situation.</p>

<p>The following are the ceiling amounts for tax year 2016:</p>

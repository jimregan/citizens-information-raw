<p>When <a href="../help_with_buying_a_home/paying_for_a_home.html">taking
out a mortgage</a>, you need to consider how it will be paid off in the event
of your death. You may also consider how to continue repayments if your income
falls, due to illness, unemployment or other reasons.</p>

<p>‘Mortgage protection’ insurance is designed to pay off your mortgage in
full if you die before the mortgage has been fully paid. ‘Mortgage repayment
protection’ insurance is designed to cover your repayments for a period in
certain circumstances.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="le8d6e">Mortgage protection insurance </h2>

<p>When you get a mortgage to buy your home, you will generally be required to
take out mortgage protection insurance. This is a particular type of life
assurance taken out for the term of the mortgage and designed to pay it off on
the death of the borrower or joint borrower.</p>

<p>In most cases, the lender is legally required under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0024/sec0126.html#sec126">Section
126 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995</a> to make sure that you have mortgage
protection insurance before giving you a mortgage, with some exceptions – see
‘Exceptions to legal requirement’ below. However, if the lender offers a
particular policy, you are not required to buy it. You can shop around for a
mortgage protection policy that suits your needs. Your lender cannot refuse you
a mortgage because you don't buy the policy it offers.</p>

<p>Mortgage protection should be payable on a joint life, first death basis.
This means that the mortgage is repaid on the death of the first borrower if a
couple is involved.</p>

<p>It is important to review your mortgage protection policy regularly and
ensure that you take out additional cover, if necessary, to cover extensions of
the mortgage term or any penalties incurred. You must keep the premiums up to
date. If you go into arrears, the policy may lapse.</p>

<p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission publishes <a href="http://www.nca.ie/nca/mortgage-protection">detailed information on
mortgage protection insurance</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Exceptions to legal requirement</strong></p>

<p>You do not have to take out mortgage protection insurance if:</p>
<ul><li>You are aged over 50 or</li>
  <li>The mortgage is not on your principal private residence (your home)
  or</li>
  <li>You cannot get the insurance, or can only get it at a much higher premium
    than normal or</li>
  <li>You already have enough life insurance to pay off the home loan if you
  die</li>
</ul><p>However, some lenders may insist that you take out mortgage protection
insurance as a condition of giving you a mortgage, even if there is no legal
requirement in your case.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="ld544f">Mortgage repayment protection insurance</h2>

<p>Mortgage repayment protection insurance is usually optional. It is a type of
payment protection insurance that is designed to repay your mortgage for a
certain amount of time – typically 12 months – if your income is reduced
because you have an accident or are made redundant, or for any other reason
covered by the particular policy.</p>

<p>You should check with your mortgage lender or insurance broker or insurance
company if you are uncertain about whether you have mortgage repayment
protection insurance. You should also check exactly what it covers and ensure
that it suits your situation.</p>

protection insurance in general</a>.</p>

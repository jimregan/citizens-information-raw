<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>As well as paying the mortgage, there are other costs involved in buying a
home. These can be significant, so it is important to be aware of them before
proceeding with the purchase.This document outlines the main costs involved.
</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l92f80">Deposit</h2>

<p>The amount of money that you can get as a mortgage loan is governed by
Central Bank lending limits, so you will need to pay the balance of the
purchase price as a deposit. In general, you will need a deposit of at least
10% of the purchase price - and possibly more, depending on your situation. See
<a href="../help_with_buying_a_home/paying_for_a_home.html">Taking out a
mortgage</a> for details of these rules. </p>

<p>If the <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning_a_home/help_with_buying_a_home/local_authority_mortgages.html">mortgage
is from a local authority</a>, the deposit may be as low as 3% of the purchase
price.</p>

<h3>Lending agency fees</h3>

<p>These may include an application fee, as well as the costs of the lender's
survey and searches. There may also be fees for mortgage loan costs and an
indemnity bond to ensure that if the lender has to repossess the property it
won't make a loss. </p>

<h3>Legal fees</h3>

<p>There is no fixed rate of charges for legal fees. Under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2002/en/act/pub/0014/sec0004.html#partii-sec4">Section
4 of the Competition Act 2002</a>, there is no fixed percentage or level of
fees. Rather, solicitors can offer competitive rates for conveyancing work -
the legal work associated with buying a home. Some may charge a flat fee and
some may charge a percentage of the purchase price. You can shop around to <a href="http://www.lawsociety.ie/Pages/Find-a-Firm/">find a solicitor</a> who
will charge the lowest possible fee. </p>

<p>There may be other costs associated with the legal process, including <a href="property_deeds.html">Land Registry</a> fees and fees for legal
searches. <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/duties_and_vat/value_added_tax.html">Value
Added Tax</a> is <span>also payable</span> on the legal fees. </p>

<h3>Buyer's survey fee</h3>

<p>This is the fee for your own survey, which is different from the survey
carried out by the lending agency. The cost can vary considerably.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.scsi.ie/">Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland
(SCSI)</a> is the professional body for chartered surveyors.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="leaff1">Insurance</h2>

<h3>Mortgage protection insurance</h3>

<p><a href="mortgage_protection.html">Mortgage protection insurance</a> is
designed to pay the balance of your mortgage if you die before the loan is
fully repaid. In general, lenders are legally obliged to make sure that you
have adequate mortgage protection cover when you take out a home loan, although
you do not have to arrange this insurance through them. Premiums vary but
always reduce over the life of the loan as the amount of the loan reduces. </p>

<p>Local authorities run their own Local Authorities Mortgage Protection Plan
and people borrowing under the Local Authorities House Purchase Loan scheme
must take out insurance through this scheme. </p>

<h3>Home insurance</h3>

<p>Most lenders will also insist that you take out adequate home insurance to
protect your home in the event of fire or other damage. You are not obliged to
purchase home insurance from your lender. </p>

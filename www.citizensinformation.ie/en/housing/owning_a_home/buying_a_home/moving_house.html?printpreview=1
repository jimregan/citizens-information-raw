<p>When moving house or apartment, you may need to close some accounts and to
transfer others to your new address. You will also need to change the contact
details that various agencies and services hold for you and you may wish to
redirect your post for a time.</p>

<p>If you are selling your home, you will need to ensure that matters such as
furniture, fittings and carpets are clearly covered in the sale agreement, in
order to avoid any disputes in future. If you are a tenant, check the
conditions of your tenancy agreement and the required notice periods, in order
to avoid any disputes with your former landlord – see ‘Leaving rented
accommodation’ below.</p>

<p>This document covers some of the items to be done when you are moving, but
it is not an exhaustive list.</p>

<h3>Redirecting post </h3>

<p>An Post’s <a href="http://www.anpost.ie/AnPost/MainContent/Personal+Customers/Managing+Mail/Redirection/">redirection
service</a> will ensure that your mail is forwarded to your new address. This
service is generally offered for periods of 3, 6 and 12 months, but you can
extend it for up to 2 years. Download the <a href="http://www.anpost.ie/AnPost/Downloads/Anpost/Residential_Mail_Redirection.pdf">application
form (pdf)</a> or get one at any post office. You will need to provide proof of
your identity and evidence of your old address and pay the <a href="http://www.anpost.ie/AnPost/GeneralTemplates/ProductsAndServices.aspx?NRMODE=Published&amp;NRNODEGUID=%7b259A1281-761C-4F56-A934-5A22F778152C%7d&amp;NRORIGINALURL=%2fAnPost%2fMainContent%2fPersonal%2bCustomers%2fManaging%2bMail%2fredirection%2ehtm&amp;NRCACHEHINT=Guest#howmuch">appropriate
fee</a>.</p>

<p>An Post will then redirect all your post to your new address from an agreed
date. You will still need to give your new address to anyone else who may be
writing to you, as your mail will not be redirected after the agreed period has
ended. Read more in <a href="http://www.anpost.ie/AnPost/MainContent/Customer+Service/custhowwehelp.htm#redirectmy">these
FAQs</a>.</p>

<h3>Leaving rented accommodation</h3>

<p>If you have been renting, whether from a local authority, housing
association or private landlord, you will need to give the landlord proper
notice if you decide to move out. If you have a written tenancy agreement or
lease, check it to see what notice period has been agreed. You will also need
to check the other conditions of your agreement to avoid any disputes with your
former landlord.</p>

<p><strong>Private tenants:</strong> Notice requirements are described in <a href="../../renting_a_home/types_of_tenancy.html">Private tenants: security
of tenure</a>. Your landlord must also abide by the terms of any lease and the
provisions of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0027/print.html">Residential
Tenancies Act 2004</a> as regards <a href="../../renting_a_home/if_your_landlord_wants_you_to_leave.html">giving
you proper notice</a>.</p>

<p>You should check the inventory, clean the accommodation and record its
condition, as well as paying any bills or charges that are due, otherwise you
may lose part or all of your deposit. Read more in Threshold’s <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/download/pdf/end_of_tenancy_checklist.pdf">checklist
on ending a tenancy (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Transferring utilities </h3>

<p>Utility accounts (such as <a href="../../../consumer_affairs/energy_and_water_services/electricity_services_in_ireland.html">electricity</a>,
<a href="../../../environment/water_services/water_charges.html">water</a>,
<a href="../../../consumer_affairs/energy_and_water_services/natural_gas_services_in_ireland.html">gas</a>
and <a shape="rect" href="/en/environment/waste_management_and_recycling/domestic_refuse.html">waste
collection</a>) will need to be either closed or transferred into the name of
the new owners or tenants of your old home. If you are moving from rented
accommodation, your landlord may ask you to transfer these services into their
name. Take final readings for all metered services before you leave, so that
the utility companies can issue final bills, and ensure that you have paid any
waste charges that you owe.</p>

<p>If you are moving into a home that has been previously occupied, ask the
previous owners to transfer the utility accounts into your name and to make
sure that there are no outstanding waste charges. Contact the utility providers
in good time to ensure that everything is connected when you move in. Take
initial readings for all metered services as soon as you take possession of the
premises.</p>

<h3>Telephone, broadband, TV</h3>

<p>For these services, you may be able to transfer your account(s) from your
previous address, depending on where you are moving and the coverage available.
Check with your service provider(s) to see whether you can transfer your
account(s) or whether you need to arrange for these services separately in your
new home. There may be a connection fee, depending on your service provider and
the type of service you require. </p>

<h3>Television licence</h3>

<p>If you have a television, you must have a <a shape="rect" href="/en/consumer_affairs/media/tv_licences.html">TV licence</a>. When moving
house, you should change the TV licence to your new address. You can do this <a href="https://www.tvlicence.ie/ChangeAddressLogOn.aspx">online</a> if you have
your TV Reference number and PIN. Otherwise, you can <a href="http://www.anpost.ie/AnPost/GeneralTemplates/ProductsAndServices.aspx?NRMODE=Published&amp;NRNODEGUID=%7b8CD7F501-3BC8-4F85-8607-C5F20F9F459F%7d&amp;NRORIGINALURL=%2fAnPost%2fMainContent%2fPersonal%2bCustomers%2fMore%2bfrom%2bAn%2bPost%2fTV%2bLicence%2ftvlicence250108%2ehtm&amp;NRCACHEHINT=Guest#recordoffices">contact
your local TV licence records office</a> to request a transfer, or else bring
the licence to a post office with a document showing the new address and asking
for your details to be updated. Your licence will be updated and re-issued to
you.</p>

<h3>Electoral Register</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../../../government_in_ireland/elections_and_referenda/voting/registering_to_vote.html">The
Electoral Register</a> is held by your local authority. You can check it <a href="http://www.checktheregister.ie/">online</a> or in <a href="../../../government_in_ireland/local_and_regional_government/local_authorities.html">local
authority</a> offices, post offices, Garda stations and <a href="../../../travel_and_recreation/recreational_activities_in_ireland/sport_and_leisure/public_library_services.html">public
libraries</a>. A new register is compiled each year and you have until 25
November to have your name included or to make any changes (such as a change of
address) to your details. If you miss this deadline, you can apply to have your
name included in the Supplement to the Electoral Register.</p>

<p>The relevant forms are <a href="http://www.checktheregister.ie/PublicPages/AppForms.aspx">available on
checktheregister.ie</a>. Send the completed form to your local authority.</p>

<h3>Motoring</h3>

<p><strong>Driving licence:</strong> You are not obliged to <a href="../../../travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/driver_licensing/updating_your_driving_licence_or_learner_permit.html">change
the address on your driving licence or learner permit</a>, but it is advisable
to do so. You must apply in person to one of the <a href="https://www.ndls.ie/where-to-apply.html">National Driver Licence Service
(NDLS) centres</a> and supply documentary evidence of the change of address.</p>

<p><strong>Motor insurance:</strong> You must contact your <a href="../../../travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/motor_tax_and_insurance/motor_insurance.html">motor
insurance</a> company or broker and let them know your new address so that your
insurance policy can be updated. Where the vehicle is kept is one of the
factors that affects your insurance premium. If you are a member of a breakdown
service, you should change your address with them also.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle registration:</strong> Fill in the change of address section
on your vehicle registration certificate and return it to the Driver and
Vehicle Licensing Computer Services Division, Department of Transport, Tourism
and Sport, Shannon, Co. Clare. They will update your details and send you a new
registration certificate.</p>

<h3>Home, health and life insurance</h3>

<p>You will need to contact your insurance company about switching your house
and contents insurance to your new home. Check if the contents of your home
will be covered during the move. Many insurers will insure contents in transit,
if they are packed and moved by professional movers. If not, most moving firms
provide insurance.</p>

<p>If you have <a href="../../../health/health_insurance/private_health_insurance.html">health
insurance</a>, <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/life-insurance">life
insurance</a> or other <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/insurance/insurance.html">insurance
policies</a>, these insurers will also need your new address details.</p>

<h3>Schools and colleges</h3>

<p>If your children will still attend their current school, it will need your
new address and contact details. If you have enrolled them in a new school,
tell their current school when they will leave and ask it to transfer your
children's records to the new school.</p>

<p>If any member of the household has applied for a <a href="../../../education/third_level_education/applying_to_college/application_procedures_and_entry_requirements.html">college
place</a> or a <a href="../../../education/third_level_education/fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/maintenance_grant_schemes_for_students_on_third_level_courses.html">student
grant</a>, they should record the new address on their application, even if you
have arranged for your post to be redirected.</p>

<h3>Financial institutions</h3>

<p>You may choose to move your bank account to a more local branch. If not,
ensure that your current bank branch has your new address. You will also need
to contact your credit union, credit card company, pension provider and any
other financial institutions where you have accounts.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>At some point in your life you may wish to buy a home. This document covers
the different stages involved.</p>

<p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has a <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/buying-a-home-step-by-step-guide">step-by-step
guide to buying a home</a> on its website. This is also available as a <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/media/NCA_buying_a_home_guide_A41.pdf">booklet
(pdf)</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="la059c">Before you decide to buy</h2>

<h3>Find out what you can afford<br></h3>

<p>It is important to evaluate all <a shape="rect" href="costs_of_buying_a_home.html">costs involved in buying a home</a>, for
example, mortgage costs, legal fees, registration of deeds and stamp duty. If
you have calculated that you can afford to buy a property taking into account
all of these costs, then you are ready to buy. </p>

<h3>Get a solicitor</h3>

<p>Conveyancing is the legal work involved in buying or selling property.
Conveyancing charges can vary between solicitors, so it is worth contacting
several solicitors to compare prices. You can use the <a href="http://www.lawsociety.ie/Pages/Find-a-Firm/">Law Society’s website</a>
to find a solicitor in your area.</p>

<h3>Find a property you like and can afford</h3>

<p>Property websites, auctioneers and estate agents are the main ways of
finding property for sale. There is a <a href="http://www.psr.ie/website/npsra/npsraweb.nsf/page/publicregister-en">public
register of auctioneers and estate agents</a> on the website of the Property
Services Regulatory Authority. </p>

<p>Sometimes individual sellers advertise their property themselves Newspapers
may also have property supplements or publish advertisements for properties for
sale.</p>

<p>The Property Services Regulatory Authority publishes a <a href="http://www.propertypriceregister.ie/">Residential Property Price
Register</a>. It contains information on residential properties bought in
Ireland since 1 January 2010. You can check the register to see what price was
paid for a property if it was sold since 1 January 2010.</p>

<p>All homes for sale must have a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.seai.ie/Your_Building/BER/Householders/">Building Energy
Rating (BER)</a>. A BER will inform you how energy-efficient the home is. It
will help you make an informed choice when comparing properties. It also offers
guidance on steps that can be taken to improve the energy efficiency of a
property.</p>

<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends that you check whether
the home is in a High Radon Area on its <a href="http://www.epa.ie/radiation">Radon Risk Map</a> and enquire as to whether
the home has been tested for radon. More information on radon in homes is
available from the <a href="http://www.epa.ie">EPA</a> and in our document on
<a href="../../../environment/environmental_protection/radon_in_buildings.html">measurement
of radon levels</a>.</p>

<h3>Get a survey</h3>

<p>A seller is under no obligation to disclose defects in a property. You
should get a survey of the property to find out if there are any defects before
finalising the purchase. The <a href="http://www.scsi.ie/">Society of Chartered
Surveyors Ireland (SCSI)</a> is the professional body for chartered
surveyors.</p>

<h3>Get mortgage approval</h3>

<p>Very few people can buy a home without getting a <a shape="rect" href="../help_with_buying_a_home/paying_for_a_home.html">mortgage</a>. A
mortgage is a long-term loan secured against the property you buy. This means
if you don’t repay your mortgage you may lose your home. </p>

<p>There are different types of mortgages and different mortgage providers.
Contact a number of different mortgage providers to find out who can offer you
the best deal. More information on mortgages and choosing the best one for you
is available from the <a href="http://www.nca.ie/nca/mortgages">Competition and
Consumer Protection Commission</a>. </p>

<p>You can get mortgage approval in principle before you start to look for a
property; this will let you know how much you have to spend. However, when you
find a property you like, you must get formal mortgage approval before you sign
the contract for sale (see below). If you sign a contract for sale and
subsequently don’t get mortgage approval, you will lose your deposit and
there may be other penalties. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l0ffdb">How to buy the property you want</h2>

<p>The two most popular methods by which properties are purchased and sold
are:<br>
• Private treaty sales <br>
• Public auction </p>

<h3>Private treaty sale</h3>

<p>A private treaty sale is where the property is not put into an auction. You
can contact the seller or the seller’s agent, usually an estate agent, to
agree a purchase price.</p>

<p>If there is an estate agent involved, once you have agreed to buy the
property you may be required to pay a booking deposit to the estate agent. The
legal process to buy the property may only start when the estate agent receives
your booking deposit. This deposit is refundable up to the signing of the
contract for sale (see below). </p>

<p>Your mortgage provider will give you formal mortgage approval and issue you
with a loan pack. You will need to have <a shape="rect" href="mortgage_protection.html">mortgage protection insurance</a> and <a href="http://www.nca.ie/nca/home-insurance">home insurance</a>. You can
organise these with your mortgage provider but it is advisable to shop around.
When your solicitor has checked the contract for sale, you will sign it and pay
a deposit (less any booking fee). </p>

<h3>Public auction</h3>

<p>Notice of the date and time of the auction is usually advertised in a local
newspaper, estate agent or by a sign on the property. A reserve figure is set
for the property, usually by the seller or the auctioneer. The reserve figure
is the value the property must achieve; anything below this and the property
will be withdrawn from the market. </p>

<p>At all times during the auction, however, the vendor (seller) can withdraw
the property from the market, even if it has achieved the reserve figure. The
vendor can also reserve the right to sell the property before the auction.</p>

<p>Before the auction takes place, your solicitor should check the contract for
sale for the property (issued by the seller's solicitor) and all title
documents that are referred to in that contract. When your solicitor has
satisfied his or her enquiries, you can organise a survey of the property to
ensure it is sound. It is also advisable to get formal mortgage approval for
the property you wish to bid for.</p>

<p>The successful bidder immediately pays a deposit and signs the contract for
sale (see below). It is important to get home insurance as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Regulation of estate agents and auctioneers</h3>

<p>Estate agents and auctioneers are regulated by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.npsra.ie/website/npsra/npsraweb.nsf/page/index-en">Property
Services Regulatory Authority</a>. The Authority has introduced a voluntary <a href="http://www.npsra.ie/website/npsra/npsraweb.nsf/0/B86586662416AA6380257CDF004322A2/%24File/Code%20of%20Practice.pdf">code
of practice for estate agents and auctioneers (pdf)</a> which sets out their
responsibilities to buyers. However, it is important to remember that the
estate agent or auctioneer is acting on behalf of the seller and is acting in
the seller’s interest.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l62973">Sign the contract for sale</h2>

<p>The <em>contract for sale</em> binds the parties to the completion of the
sale. If you withdraw from the sale after this contract has been signed, you
may lose your deposit. If you buy at auction you must immediately sign the
contract for sale. If you buy through private treaty your solicitor will check
that the contract is in order before you sign it.</p>

<p>In the case of new developments this contract for sale usually includes
"building agreements" as most properties these days are sold and developed by
the same company. In the past, but now rarely, one company would sell land to a
buyer and a different company would build on it. In such instances, the
contract is actually a "contract for sale and building agreement" but in almost
all residential sales, a contract is simply known as a contract for sale. The
completion date will be set out in the contract and the balance of the agreed
purchase price will be due on that date. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l9548e">Closing the sale </h2>

<h3>Requisitions on Title and Deed of Conveyance<br></h3>

<p>After signing the contract and before the completion date of the sale, your
solicitor raises some general queries about the property with the seller's
solicitor. <em>Requisitions on Title</em> are a standard set of questions
relating to the sale of a property that deal with such things as whether
fixtures and fittings are included in the sale. </p>

<p>When your solicitor gets a satisfactory reply to Requisitions on Title, a
<em>Deed of Conveyance</em> is drafted by him or her and approved by the
seller's solicitor. </p>

<p>Your solicitor makes arrangements for searches to be made against the seller
to ensure that there are no judgements lying against the seller (for example,
bankruptcy or sheriffs' searches). Your solicitor should also conduct a search
where the title to the property is held (either in the Land Registry or the
Registry of Deeds) to ensure that there is nothing adverse attaching to the
property, for example, an outstanding mortgage.</p>

<p>Once the Deed of Conveyance is approved by the seller's solicitor, your
solicitor will contact your mortgage provider to request the issue of the
approved loan cheque. This is the remaining balance of the purchase price. It
is paid to the seller's solicitor and all documentation, and keys to the
premises are handed over to your solicitor.</p>

<h3>Stamp duty<br></h3>

<p>Your solicitor will calculate how much <a shape="rect" href="stamp_duty.html">stamp duty</a> is due and request this from you before
the closing of the sale. The stamp duty is paid to the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/">Revenue Commissioners</a>, who place a stamp on
the deeds. Without this stamp, the deeds cannot be registered. The deeds name
the owner of the property.</p>

<h2 class="further_info" id="l77f54">After the sale is completed</h2>

<h3>Deeds <br></h3>

<p>Once a sale is completed, your <a href="property_deeds.html">deeds</a>,
showing the new ownership details and mortgage details, if relevant, must be
registered with either the Registry of Deeds or the Land Registry. The <a href="http://www.prai.ie/">Property Registration Authority (PRA)</a> is
responsible for both systems of registration. </p>

<p>Your solicitor will continue to assist you with finalising the deeds to your
house with the PRA. This can take from months to years to complete. Even if it
does take a long time, you are still the owner of the property and, if you
wish, you can sell the property before registration is complete.</p>

<h3>Moving house<br></h3>

<p>There are many things to do when moving house, for example, redirecting your
post and changing your details on the <a href="../../../government_in_ireland/elections_and_referenda/voting/registering_to_vote.html">electoral
register</a>. More information is available in our document on <a shape="rect" href="moving_house.html">moving to a new home</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>A new Help to Buy (HTB) incentive has been introduced. It is designed to
help first-time buyers of newly built homes to assemble the required deposit.
It also applies to once-off self-build homes.</p>

<p>The Help to Buy scheme provides for a refund of <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/">income tax</a> and <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/tax_on_savings_and_investments/deposit_interest_retention_tax.html">Deposit
Interest Retention Tax (DIRT)</a> paid over the previous 4 tax years.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you are a first-time buyer who either buys or self-builds a new
residential property between <strong>19 July 2016</strong> and <strong>31
December 2019</strong>, you may be entitled to claim a refund of income tax and
DIRT paid over the previous 4 tax years.</p>

<p>If you signed a contract to buy a property (or drew down the first tranche
of the mortgage for a self-build) <strong>before 19 July 2016</strong>, you
will not qualify for this incentive.</p>

<p>If you are buying (or self-building) the property with someone else, they
must also be a first-time buyer. You will not qualify if you have previously
bought or built a property, either individually or jointly with anyone else,
even if you are now separated or divorced from that person.</p>

<p>The incentive only applies to properties that are bought or built as the
first-time buyer’s home. It does not cover investment properties. Cash buyers
do not qualify.</p>

<p>You must <a href="paying_for_a_home.html">take out a mortgage</a> of at
least 70% of the purchase price (or, for a self-build, 70% of the valuation
approved by the mortgage provider). </p>

<p>If you signed a contract to buy a property (or drew down the first tranche
of the mortgage for a self-build) <strong>between 19 July 2016 and 31 December
2016</strong>, you may qualify for the Help to Buy incentive on a property
costing up to €600,000.</p>

<p>With effect from <strong>1 January 2017</strong>, the Help to Buy scheme
only applies to properties costing €500,000 or less.</p>

<p>You must occupy the property for 5 years from the date that it is
habitable.</p>

<h3>Tax requirements</h3>

<p>If you pay tax through PAYE, you must be registered for Revenue’s online
<a href="https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/register.html?execution=e1s1">myAccount</a>
service. If you are a self-assessed taxpayer, you must be registered for the
Revenue Online Service <a href="http://www.ros.ie/PublisherServlet/info/setupnewcust">ROS</a>.</p>

<p>In all cases, you must be fully tax-compliant in respect of the 4 years
immediately prior to your claim.</p>

<p>If you have not already done so, you will need to complete online Form 12
(PAYE) and Form 11 (self-assessed) in respect of each of those 4 years. You
must also pay any outstanding taxes that are due.</p>

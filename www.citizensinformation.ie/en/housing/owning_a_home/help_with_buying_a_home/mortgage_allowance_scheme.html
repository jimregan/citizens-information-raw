<p>Social housing tenants and tenant purchasers who are taking out a mortgage
to buy or build a private house may qualify for the Mortgage Allowance Scheme.
The Scheme is designed to ease the transition from social housing to paying a
mortgage.</p>

<p>An allowance of up to €11,450 is payable directly to the lending agency
over a 5-year period and your repayments are reduced accordingly for the first
5 years of the mortgage. Your mortgage may be from a <a shape="rect" href="paying_for_a_home.html">commercial lending agency</a> or from a <a shape="rect" href="local_authority_mortgages.html">local authority</a>.</p>

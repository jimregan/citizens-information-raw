<p>Local authorities may provide housing sites at low cost to help people in
need of housing, to provide their own housing. The local authority decides the
cost of the site; it may be as low as â‚¬127.</p>

<p>The building costs may be funded by a mortgage from a bank, building
society, or if you are eligible, by a <a shape="rect" href="local_authority_mortgages.html">local authority mortgage</a>. The scheme
is specifically designed to be used with other housing schemes such as the <a shape="rect" href="shared_ownership.html">Shared Ownership Scheme</a>; <a shape="rect" href="affordable_housing.html">the Affordable Housing Scheme</a>
and <a shape="rect" href="mortgage_allowance_scheme.html">the Mortgage
Allowance Scheme</a>.</p>

<p>If the site needs specialised development works to enable construction to go
ahead, the local authority may make a financial contribution to these costs.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you are:</p>
<ul><li>Registered on a housing waiting list with a local authority, or </li>
  <li>A local authority tenant or a tenant purchaser and you want to buy a
    private house and return your present house to the local authority, or </li>
  <li>A tenant for more than one year of a home provided by a housing
    association under the Rental Subsidy Scheme and you want to buy a private
    house and return your present house to the local authority, or </li>
  <li>A member of a co-operative or non-profit housing group of which at least
    75% of the members are tenants, tenant purchasers or registered on the
    local authority housing waiting list or </li>
  <li>A person involved in a group shared ownership project* </li>
</ul><p>then you may be able to get a low cost site for the building of a new
house.</p>

<p><span>*A group shared ownership project</span> is a housing scheme
consisting of shared ownership housing which is sponsored by a local authority
or housing co-operative. Low cost sites can be made available by the local
authority for all the houses in the scheme whether or not each individual would
be eligible.</p>

<h3>Selling your house</h3>

<p>If you sell your house within 10 years, you will have to pay the local
authority the difference between the sale price and the market value of the
site. This amount will reduce by 10% each year after that, so if you sell after
20 years, you will not have to pay anything to the local authority.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Home Choice Loan is a mortgage for first-time buyers who cannot get a
mortgage or sufficient finance from a bank or a building society. It provides
access to credit for first-time buyers who can afford to purchase on the open
market and can afford to repay a mortgage. </p>

<p>A Home Choice Loan is the same as a normal capital- and interest-bearing
mortgage and is repaid on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>Four designated local authorities provide Home Choice Loans on behalf of all
local authorities. </p>

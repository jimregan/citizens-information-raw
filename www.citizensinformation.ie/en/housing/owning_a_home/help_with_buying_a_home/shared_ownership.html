<p>The Shared Ownership Scheme was aimed at people who could not afford to buy
their entire home in one go. <strong>It has now been stood down for new
applicants.</strong> The rules of the scheme continue to apply for people who
used it to start buying a home. An <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/DevelopmentHousing/Housing/HomeOwnership/IncrementalPurchaseScheme/">Incremental
Purchase Scheme</a> will provide another way for people on low incomes to start
buying a home, subject to certain conditions. </p>

<p>Some borrowers are facing affordability issues with their Shared Ownership
properties. Several measures have been developed to alleviate these
difficulties. Contact your <a href="http://www.environ.ie/local-government/administration/local-authorities/local-authorities">local
authority</a> for information about your options. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="la9a7c">People who are buying Shared Ownership
homes</h2>

<p>You may increase the proportion you are buying at any time, either by adding
to your mortgage or paying cash. You must buy the full ownership within 30
years. This does not mean that you have to repay all capital outstanding on the
mortgage within the 30-year period. You may take out another mortgage to buy
out the remaining share when the original mortgage is paid off.</p>

<p>You can sell the house or apartment at any time. The local authority will,
of course, be entitled to claim the value of the proportion it owns at the time
of sale. If it provided the house or apartment at a discount from the market
value, you must refund a proportion of this discount, depending on how long you
have lived in it.</p>

<p>Transactions under the Shared Ownership Scheme are exempt from <a href="../buying_a_home/stamp_duty.html">stamp duty</a>. Local authorities
are also required to keep legal costs to a minimum. </p>

<h3>Household Charge</h3>

<p>If your home was in Shared Ownership with the local authority on the
liability date for the <a href="../home_owners/household_charge.html">Household Charge</a> (1 January
2012), it was exempt from the Household Charge, as the local authority still
retained an ownership stake in the property. Your home did not have to be
registered in order for you to claim the exemption.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lf9792">How the scheme worked</h2>

<h3></h3>

<p>The Shared Ownership Scheme allowed people to start by buying a proportion
of a home, increasing that proportion in steps until they owned it all, and
with ownership shared between the buyer and the local authority. Buyers would
make payments on a mortgage for the part being purchased and pay rent to the
local authority for the other part at a rate of 4.3%.</p>

<p>To avail of the scheme, you had to:</p>
<ul><li>Get approved in principle for shared ownership by the local authority</li>
  <li>Identify a new or existing house or build a new house (some local
    authorities also had homes for sale under the scheme at a discount).</li>
  <li>Ensure that the home was suitable for your needs, met certain minimum
    standards and was acceptable to the local authority.</li>
</ul><p>If the local authority was satisfied that you could afford the mortgage
repayments and the rent, it would buy the house or apartment and grant you a
shared ownership lease. From the start, you had to buy at least 40% of the
house or apartment.</p>

<h3>Upper limits for purchasers</h3>

<p>Some local authorities operated an upper limit on the amount that could be
borrowed under the scheme. This amount varied, depending on the location of the
property and the local authority involved.</p>

<p>Local authorities could also set a maximum percentage of income that could
be apportioned to rental/mortgage payments. In each case the long-term
viability of the mortgage/rental payments was the key concern.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To qualify for the Shared Ownership Scheme you had to be:</p>
<ul><li>In need of housing and your income satisfied the income test below,
  or</li>
  <li>Registered on a housing waiting list with a local authority, or</li>
  <li>A local authority tenant or a tenant purchaser (if you wanted to buy a
    private house, you had to return your local authority house to the local
    authority), or</li>
  <li>A tenant for more than one year of a home provided by a housing
    association under the Capital Loan Scheme and you wanted to buy a private
    house/apartment and return your existing house/apartment to the housing
    association.</li>
</ul><p>The income test only applied to the first category; if you were covered by
the second, third or fourth category, you were exempt from the income test.</p>

<p>You had to buy at least 40% of the price the local authority paid for the
house/apartment.</p>

<h3>The income test</h3>
<ul><li>Single-income household: if your gross income (before tax) in the last
    income tax year was €40,000 or less you were eligible.</li>
  <li>Two-income households: multiply the gross income (before tax) of the
    higher earner in the last income tax year by 2.5. Add the gross income of
    the other earner in the last income tax year. If the answer was €100,000
    or less, you were eligible.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<h3>Total monthly payment</h3>

<p>This amount depends on the cost of the house, the proportion you are renting
and current interest rates.</p>

<h3>Rent subsidy</h3>

<p>If your household income in the last income tax year was less than €28,000
per year, you could qualify for a rent subsidy of between €1,050 to €2,550
per year as long as the subsidy would not reduce the rent below €1 per
week.</p>

<h3>Deposit</h3>

<p>The local authority could waive the €1,270 deposit if: </p>
<ul><li>You were resettling in a rural area from a major urban area and</li>
  <li>You were giving up a local authority house or had been approved for local
    authority housing.</li>
</ul></div>

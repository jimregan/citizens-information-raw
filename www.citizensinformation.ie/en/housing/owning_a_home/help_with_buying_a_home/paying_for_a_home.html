<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are buying a home, you will probably have to take out a mortgage,
which is a long-term loan to finance a property purchase. If you cannot get a
mortgage from a commercial lender (bank) you may be eligible for a <a href="local_authority_mortgages.html">loan from a local authority</a>. As
your home will be secured against the loan, you must keep up your payments or
risk <a href="../../losing_your_home">losing your home</a>.</p>

<p>This document outlines some issues to consider when thinking of taking out a
mortgage, topping up an existing home loan or switching to a different mortgage
product – known as a switcher mortgage. It is aimed at private individuals
who are buying their own homes.</p>

<p>Note that <a href="../buying_a_home/mortgage_interest_relief.html">mortgage interest
relief</a> is no longer available for new mortgages. However, if you are a
first-time buyer, you may be entitled to claim <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/dirt/first-time-buyer-relief.html">First
Time Buyers Relief</a>, which is a refund of <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/tax_on_savings_and_investments/deposit_interest_retention_tax.html">Deposit
Interest Retention Tax (DIRT)</a>.</p>

<h3>Help-to-Buy incentive</h3>

<p>An income tax rebate, the Help-to-Buy (HTB) incentive, has been introduced
to help first-time buyers of newly built homes to fund the deposit required. It
also applies to once-off self-build homes. It consists of a rebate of income
tax paid over the previous 4 years.</p>

<p>This incentive applies with effect from 19 July 2016 and will run until the
end of 2019. Read more about the <a href="help_to_buy_incentive.html">HTB

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lbc94b">Mortgage approval</h2>

<p>Commercial lenders offer a range of mortgage rates and products. Before
starting to look for a home, you should check with potential lenders to get a
statement of how much they are prepared to lend you. This is called
<em>approval in principle</em>. Getting approval in principle will indicate
what price range you can consider when looking for somewhere to buy.</p>

<p>However, approval in principle doesn’t mean that the lender has approved a
mortgage and agreed to lend you this amount. The official mortgage approval is
contained in a <em>letter of offer</em>, which the lender will only issue when
it is fully satisfied with certain matters, including a valuation of the
property you are buying.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l4e5b7">Mortgage lending limits</h2>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/si/47/made/en/print">Regulations</a>
in effect since 9 February 2015, the Central Bank <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/press-area/press-releases/Pages/CentralBankannouncesnewregulationsonresidentialmortgagelending.aspx">set
limits</a> on the size of housing loans made by the commercial lenders that it
regulates. Following an evaluation and consultation process, the <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/press-area/press-releases/Pages/OutcomeofReviewofMortgageMeasuresannounced.aspx">Central
Bank announced</a> in November 2016 that revised limits would take effect from
1 January 2017, under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/si/568/made/en/print">new
Regulations</a>.</p>

<p>The limits are described on <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/mortgage-borrowing-limits">consumerhelp.ie</a>
and on the <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/stability/MacroprudentialPol/Pages/LoantoValueLoantoIncome.aspx">Central
Bank’s website</a>.  </p>

<h3>Scope of limits</h3>

<p>Equity release and top-up on an existing mortgage are both within the scope
of the limits, but they do not apply to switcher mortgages, or to the
restructuring of mortgages in <a href="../mortgage_arrears/overview_of_mortgage_debt.html">arrears or
pre-arrears</a>. </p>

<h3>How the limits work</h3>

<p>There are 2 types of limit – one based on the ratio of the loan to the
price of the house – known as loan-to-value or LTV – and the other based on
the ratio of the loan to the income(s) of the borrower(s) – known as
loan-to-income or LTI. In general, both of these limits will have to be met for
the mortgage to meet the Central Bank’s requirements. However, the
Regulations allow lenders to be flexible in some cases – see ‘Lender
flexibility’ below.</p>

<p>As well as meeting the limits, the lender must also assess each loan
application on a case-by-case basis – see ‘Assessment by the lender’
below.</p>

<h3>Loan-to-income limit (LTI)</h3>

<p>There is a general limit of 3.5 times gross annual income for all new
mortgage lending for principal dwelling homes, with some scope for flexibility.
This includes lending to people in negative equity who are applying for a
mortgage for a new property. This limit does not apply to buy-to-let mortgages.
</p>

<h3>Loan-to-value limit (LTV)</h3>

<p>There are different limits for different categories of buyer. Again, lenders
have some scope for flexibility – see ‘Lender flexibility’ below.</p>

<p>Originally, the valuation of the property must have been carried out no
later than 2 months before the date of the mortgage agreement. Withe effect
from 1 January 2017, this increased to 4 months. </p>

<p><em>Up to 31 December 2016:</em> For <strong>first-time buyers of principal
dwelling homes</strong> there was a limit of 90% LTV on the first €220,000 of
the value of a residential property, so first-time buyers needed a deposit of
10% for a house or apartment costing €220,000 or less.</p>

<p>A limit of 80% LTV applied on any excess value of the property above
€220,000, so first-time buyers needed a deposit of 10% on the first
€220,000 and 20% of any balance above €220,000.</p>

<p><em>From 1 January 2017:</em> For <strong>first-time buyers of principal
dwelling homes</strong> the limit of 90% LTV applies on the full value of all
residential property, so first-time buyers will need a deposit of 10% for any
house or apartment, regardless of price.</p>

<p>For <strong>non-first-time home-buyers</strong>, there is a limit of 80% of
LTV on new mortgage lending, whatever the price of the property, so they will
need a deposit of 20% of the total purchase price. </p>

<p>For <strong>properties other than principal dwelling homes</strong>,
including buy-to-let properties, a limit of 70% LTV applies. </p>

<p>The LTV limits do not apply to <strong>borrowers in negative equity</strong>
applying for a mortgage for a new property. However, lenders may still opt to
apply stricter lending standards, based on their assessment of each case. </p>

<h3>Lender flexibility</h3>

<p>The Central Bank rules allow discretion for lenders to exceed the LTI limit
of 3.5 times income in up to 20% of cases in any calendar year. </p>

<p>Originally, the rules also allowed for 15% of total lending for all primary
dwellings in a calendar year (for all buyers, first-time and others) to be
above the LTV limits.</p>

<p>Since 1 January 2017, the revised rules allow for 5% of the value of new
lending to first-time buyers for primary residences in a calendar year to be
above the 90% LTV limit. They allow for 20% of the value of new lending to
second and subsequent buyers for primary residences to be above the 80%
limit.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l5f159">Assessing a mortgage offer</h2>

<p>It is very important for you to be satisfied that the mortgage is affordable
from your point of view and that it is sustainable – you should be able to
keep up the repayments over the lifetime of the mortgage.</p>

<h3>Information about the offer</h3>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/si/142/made/en/print">European
Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016</a>, which
transposed the Mortgage Credit Directive into Irish law, the lender must
provide you with a <em>European Standardised Information Sheet (ESIS)</em>,
setting out the details of the mortgage offer. The Regulations specify the
detailed information that the ESIS must contain, which includes:</p>
<ul><li>How long the offer will be valid for</li>
  <li>Contact details of the lender or their representative</li>
  <li>Main features of the loan, including potential risks</li>
  <li>Type and duration of credit</li>
  <li>Full details of borrowing rate(s) and when and how they may be revised,
    if applicable</li>
  <li>Total amount that you will pay over the lifetime of the mortgage</li>
</ul><p>For a full specification of the ESIS and instructions on what it must
contain, see Schedule 2 of the Regulations.</p>

<p>You can use the information in the ESIS and other sources to assess the
mortgage offer.</p>

<h3>Other sources of information</h3>

<p>Information on the various <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/types-of-mortgages">types of mortgage</a> is
available on <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/">consumerhelp.ie</a>, along
with a set of <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/index.jsp?p=107&amp;n=150">mortgage
calculators</a> that you can use to work out your monthly repayments and the
effects of a rate change. </p>

<p>You should work out your income and expenditure and assess how they are
likely to change over time, depending on your employment situation, your family
situation and your stage in life. You can use these <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/budgeting-calculators">budgeting
calculators</a> as a starting point.</p>

<p>You may wish to <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/index.jsp?p=105&amp;n=142">look for financial
advice</a>. Consumerhelp.ie explains the different types of adviser available.
It lists questions to ask and steps to take when <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/choosing-a-financial-advisor">shopping around
for financial advice</a>.</p>

<h3>Suggested questions</h3>

<p>A mortgage loan is a serious and long-term commitment. You’ll need to do
your research and ask some questions about the loan and its implications over
the long term, such as:</p>
<ul><li>How does the interest rate (<a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/jargon-buster#apr">APR</a>) <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/mortage-interest-rates">compare to others
    in the market</a>?</li>
  <li>Research the lender’s policy and track record on changing interest
    rates. Even a small variation in interest rates can have a large effect on
    the overall cost of your mortgage. You can use this <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/rate-change-calculator">mortgage rate
    calculator</a> to assess these effects.</li>
  <li>Can I realistically afford to keep up the monthly payments if my income
    falls or my outgoings increase? You need to assess your continuing ability
    to repay as circumstances change over time.</li>
  <li>If I accept an introductory offer, will I be able to manage when the
    ‘introductory’ period is over? Again, you need to calculate your
    ability to repay – over the full term of the mortgage, not just the first
    few years.</li>
  <li>What insurance do I need on the mortgage? Read about <a href="../buying_a_home/mortgage_protection.html">insurance protection on
    mortgages</a>.</li>
</ul><h3>Assessment by the lender</h3>

<p>In addition to the Central Bank’s lending limits, its <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/consumer/cpc/Pages/home1.aspx">Consumer
Protection Code 2012</a> requires all regulated lenders to assess your personal
circumstances and financial situation thoroughly before agreeing to provide a
mortgage.</p>

<p>The lender must carry out detailed assessments of the affordability of the
product being offered and of its suitability for you. When offering you a
mortgage, the lender must give you a written statement, setting out the reasons
why the mortgage product being offered is considered suitable for your needs,
objectives and circumstances.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/si/142/made/en/print">European
Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016</a> also require
lenders to conduct a creditworthiness assessment prior to offering a mortgage
loan.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="ldcd29">Paying the mortgage</h2>

<p>Once you have taken out the mortgage, you are now committed to paying the
monthly instalments as agreed in the contract with your lender. You should keep
all correspondence and documentation from your lender in a safe place, as well
as documents relating to insurance on your mortgage, house and contents.</p>

<p>It is very important to keep up your mortgage repayments. If you don’t,
your <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/credit_ratings.html">credit
rating</a> will be damaged and your home will be at risk.</p>

<h3>Problems paying the mortgage</h3>

<p>If you are having difficulty managing your finances, there are several
things you can do. The <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/mabs_service.html">Money
Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS)</a> can help you to review your income and
your outgoings, make out a budget and deal with your debts in general.</p>

<p>Even if you have not yet missed a mortgage payment, you are protected by the
Central Bank’s <a href="../mortgage_arrears/consumer_protection_codes_and_mortgages.html">Code
of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears</a> if you contact your lender and let them know
that you are having a problem.</p>

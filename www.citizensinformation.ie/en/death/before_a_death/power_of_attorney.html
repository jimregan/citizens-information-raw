<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l07de2">Introduction </h2>

<p>Power of attorney is a legal device in Ireland that can be set up by a
person (the donor) during his/her life when he/she is in good mental health. It
allows another specially appointed person (the attorney) to take actions on the
donor's behalf if he/she is absent, abroad or incapacitated through illness.
The relevant legislation is the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0012/index.html">Powers of
Attorney Act 1996</a> and the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/si/0196.html">Enduring Powers of
Attorney Regulations 1996 (SI No. 196/1996)</a> as amended by <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/si/0287.html">SI No. 287/1996</a>.
</p>

<p>Part 7 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/64/enacted/en/html">Assisted
Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015</a> provides for new arrangements for those
who wish to make an Enduring Power of Attorney. When the 2015 Act is commenced,
no new Enduring Power of Attorneys will be created under the 1996 Act.</p>

<p>If someone in Ireland is mentally incapacitated (for example, because of
illness, disability or a progressive degenerative illness), all of their assets
and property are normally frozen and cannot be used by anyone else unless they
are jointly owned or, someone has <span>power of attorney</span> to deal with
their property or money. </p>

<p>In a larger sense, power of attorney is just one of the legal arrangements
that you can make during your lifetime, in the event you become incapacitated
or unable to deal with your affairs. Information to help guide you in recording
and registering your preferences in the event of emergency, serious illness or
death is available at <a href="http://www.thinkahead.ie/">Thinkahead.ie</a>,
where you can also download the <a href="http://www.thinkahead.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Think-Ahead-July-2014.pdf">Think
Ahead Form (pdf)</a>. Read more about the <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/legal_matters_and_health/legal_arrangements_for_incapacity.html">legal
arrangements in the event of incapacity here</a>. </p>

<h3>Types of power of attorney</h3>

<p>There are two types of power of attorney allowed under Irish law: </p>
<ul><li><span>Power of attorney</span> which gives either a specific or a general
    power and ceases as soon as the donor becomes incapacitated </li>
  <li><span>Enduring power of attorney</span> which takes effect on the
    incapacity of the donor</li>
</ul><p>Both <span>cease on the death of the donor</span>. However, it may be
difficult to prove that the donor is dead if his/her body cannot be found, for
example, as in the case of a death by drowning. Once the body is found or the
donor is declared to be "believed dead" by a court (usually after 7 years have
passed), the power of attorney (if there was one) ends and their affairs are
dealt with in the normal way by will or under intestacy law.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l69954">Power of attorney</h2>

<p>A power of attorney can be specific (limited to a particular purpose, for
example, sale of your house in your absence) or general (entitling the attorney
to do almost everything that you yourself could do). For example, it may allow
the attorney to take a wide range of actions on the donor's behalf in relation
to property, business, and financial affairs. He/she may make payments from the
specified accounts, make appropriate provision for any specified person's
needs, and make appropriate gifts to the donor's relations or friends.</p>

<p>You do not require a solicitor to create a general power of attorney. It can
be created when signed either by you or at your direction and in the presence
of a witness. However, it is advisable to get legal advice before you sign a
form appointing someone else to manage your affairs. You can appoint anyone you
wish to be your attorney. </p>

<p>A form of general power of attorney is given in the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0012/sched3.html#sched3">Third
Schedule of the Powers of Attorney Act 1996</a>. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l73f44">Enduring power of attorney</h2>

<p>An enduring power of attorney (EPA) also allows the attorney to make
"personal care decisions" on the donor's behalf once he/she is no longer fully
mentally capable of taking decisions themself. Personal care decisions may
include deciding where and with whom the donor will live, who he/she should see
or not see and what training or rehabilitation he/she should get. However, if
the donor wants, he/she can specifically exclude any of these powers when
setting up the power of attorney or can make the attorney's powers subject to
any reasonable conditions and restrictions.</p>

<p>You can appoint anyone you wish to be your attorney, including a spouse,
civil partner, family member, friend, colleague, etc. The procedure for
creating an enduring power of attorney is much more complex than that for
creating a general power of attorney.</p>

<h3>Creating an enduring power of attorney</h3>

<p>Because the enduring power of attorney involves the transfer of considerable
powers from you to another person, there are a number of legal safeguards to
protect you from abuses. The procedure for executing the enduring power of
attorney is complex and requires the involvement of a solicitor and a doctor.
The enduring power can only come into effect when certain procedures have been
gone through and the courts have a general supervisory role in the
implementation of the power.</p>

<p>The document creating the power must be in a particular format and must
include the following:</p>
<ul><li>A statement by a doctor verifying that in his/her opinion you had the
    mental capacity at the time that the document was executed to understand
    the effect of creating the power </li>
  <li>A statement from you that you understood the effect of creating the power
  </li>
  <li>A statement from a <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a> that he/she is
    satisfied that you understood the effect of creating the power of attorney
  </li>
  <li>A statement from a solicitor that you were not acting under undue
    influence </li>
</ul><p>At least 2 people must be notified of the making of an EPA, none of whom
will be the attorney. One of the notice parties must be your spouse or civil
partner if living with you. If this does not apply, one of your notice parties
must be your child. If neither is applicable, one of the notice parties must be
any relative (that is parent, sibling, grandchild, widow/widower/surviving
civil partner of child, nephew or niece). </p>

<h3>Who cannot be appointed?</h3>

<p>An enduring power of attorney may be granted to individuals or trust
corporations but may not be granted to the following people: </p>
<ul><li>People under the age of 18 </li>
  <li>Bankrupts </li>
  <li>People convicted of offences involving fraud or dishonesty </li>
  <li>People disqualified under the Companies Acts </li>
  <li>An individual or trust corporation who owns a nursing home in which you
    live or an employee or agent of the owner, unless that person is also your
    spouse, civil partner, child or sibling</li>
</ul><h3>Registration</h3>

<p>The EPA can only come into force when it has been registered. However, once
an application to register the EPA has been made, the attorney may take action
under the EPA's powers to maintain you and prevent loss to your estate. The
attorney may also take action to maintain themself and other persons, in so far
as it is permitted under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0012/sec0006.html#sec6">Section
6 (4) of the 1996 Act</a>. The attorney may also make any personal care
decisions permitted under the powers that cannot reasonably be deferred until
the application for registration has been determined.</p>

<p>Also, in certain circumstances before the EPA is registered, application may
be made to the court to exercise the EPA's powers under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0012/sec0012.html">Section
12 of the Act</a>.</p>

<p>In order to register an EPA, the future attorney makes an application for
registration to the <a href="../../justice/court_offices/office_of_wards_of_court.html">Registrar
of Wards of Court</a>, once there is reason to believe that you are or are
becoming mentally incapable. The attorney must have a medical certificate
confirming that you are incapable of managing your affairs.</p>

<p>Five weeks before making this application, the attorney must notify you and
the notice parties of his/her intention to do so. Within the 5 weeks, the donor
or a notice party can lodge a notice of objection on one of the grounds given
in <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0012/sec0010.html#sec10">Section
10 (3) of the Act</a> with the Registrar of Wards of Court.</p>

<h3>The role of the High Court</h3>

<p>The High Court has an extensive supervisory role in respect of the EPA.
Among other things, the court has power to give directions about the management
and disposal of your property. The court may confirm the revocation of a power
of attorney if it is satisfied that you were mentally competent to revoke it.
The court can order cancellation of the power where it is satisfied that:</p>
<ul><li>You are mentally capable and likely to remain so </li>
  <li>The attorney is unsuitable </li>
  <li>Fraud or undue pressure was used to induce you to create the power</li>
</ul><h3>Scope of authority of an enduring power of attorney</h3>

<p>The EPA may give general authority to the attorney to do anything that the
attorney might lawfully do or it may merely give authority to do specific acts
on your behalf. </p>

<p>The attorney may make certain personal care decisions - these must be made
in your best interests, must be in accordance with what you would have been
likely to do and the attorney must consult family members and carers in making
these decisions. The attorney is considered to be acting in your best interests
if he/she reasonably believes that what he/she decides is in your best
interests.</p>

<p>A personal care decision is a decision concerning one or more of the
following: </p>
<ul><li>Where and with whom you should live </li>
  <li>Whom you should see and not see </li>
  <li>What training and rehabilitation you should get </li>
  <li>Your diet and dress </li>
  <li>Inspection of your personal papers </li>
  <li>Housing, social welfare and other benefits</li>
</ul><p>The list does not include health care decisions, although the borderline
between personal care and health care decisions is not always clear. However,
it seems clear that the attorney does not have the power to make a decision as
to whether or not a person suffering from dementia should undergo surgery. </p>

<h3>Revocation of an enduring power of attorney</h3>

<p>The donor can revoke an EPA at any time before an application is made to
register it. Once the EPA has been registered you cannot revoke it even if you
are, for the time being, mentally capable. To revoke it, you would have to
apply to the court and the court approve the revocation. </p>

<h3>Termination of an enduring power of attorney</h3>

<p>An EPA ceases on the death of the donor. However, there are other
circumstances in which an EPA ceases to have effect. For example, where a
spouse or civil partner is the attorney, the EPA ceases where:</p>
<ul><li>The marriage/civil partnership no longer exists due to annulment, divorce
    or dissolution</li>
  <li>A judicial separation is granted or the couple enter into a separation
    agreement</li>
  <li>A protection, barring or similar order is made on the application of
    either spouse/civil partner</li>
</ul><p>An EPA ceases where the attorney becomes one of the people listed above who
cannot be granted enduring powers of attorney. The court can make an order
cancelling an EPA where, for example, it finds the attorney is unsuitable.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>A will is a witnessed document that sets out in writing the deceased's
wishes for his or her possessions, (called his or her 'estate'), after death.
</p>

<h3>Reasons for making a will</h3>

<p>It is important for you to make a will because if you do not, and die
without a will, the law on intestacy decides what happens to your property. A
will can ensure that proper arrangements are made for your dependants and that
your property is distributed in the way you wish after you die, subject to
certain rights of spouses/civil partners and children.</p>

<p>It is also advisable to complete and keep updated a list of your assets. You
can use a form such as our form, <a href="../../reference/checklists/checklist_of_where_my_possessions_are_kept.html">Where
my possessions are kept</a>. It will make it easier to identify and trace your
assets after you die. You should keep the list in a safe place. </p>

<h3>What happens if you die having made a will</h3>

<p>If you have made a will, you are called a testator (male) or testatrix
(female). A person who dies having made a valid will is said to have died
'testate'. If you die testate, then all your possessions will be distributed in
the way you set out in your will. It is the job of the executor or executors
you named in your will to make sure this happens. There are legal limits as to
how much of your property goes to which person, as set out in law in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1965/en/act/pub/0027/index.html">Succession
Act, 1965</a>. An executor can be a beneficiary under the will. In other words,
the executor can also inherit under the will.</p>

<p>After you die, somebody has to deal with your estate, by gathering together
all your money and possessions, paying any debts you owe and then distributing
what is left to the people who are entitled to it. If you leave a will before
you die, one or more of the executors you named in your will usually has to get
legal permission from the Probate Office or the District Probate Registry for
the area in which you lived at the time of death to do this. Permission comes
in the form of a document called a Grant of Representation. </p>

<p>If you did not name any executors in your will or if the executors are
unable or unwilling to apply for a Grant of Representation, documents called
Letters of Administration (With Will) are issued. When your estate is
distributed, the legal rights of your spouse/civil partner and children, if
any, will be fulfilled first after any debts are paid before any other gifts
are considered. </p>

<h3>What happens if you die without a will or your will is invalid</h3>

<p>A person who dies without a will is said to have died 'intestate'. If you
die intestate, this means your estate, or everything that you own, is
distributed in accordance with the law by an administrator. To do this, the
administrator needs permission in the form of a Grant of Representation. When a
person dies without a will or when their will is invalid, this Grant is issued
as Letters of Administration by the Probate Office or the District Probate
Registry for the area in which the person lived at the time of death. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Distribution of your estate when you die intestate or have not made a valid
will</h3>

<p>The legal rules governing the distribution of your property apply:</p>
<ul><li>When you have not made a will </li>
  <li>When the will has been denied probate because it has not been made
    properly or a challenge to it has been successful </li>
  <li>When the will does not completely deal with all your possessions. </li>
</ul><p>In these cases, after debts and expenses have been deducted, the estate is
distributed in the following way.</p>

<p>If you are survived by:</p>
<ul><li>A spouse/civil partner but no children (or grandchildren): your
    spouse/civil partner gets the entire estate. </li>
  <li>A spouse/civil partner and children: your spouse/civil partner gets
    two-thirds of your estate and the remaining one-third is divided equally
    among your children. If one of your children has died, that share goes to
    his/her children. </li>
  <li>Children, but no spouse/civil partner: your estate is divided equally
    among your children (or their children). </li>
  <li>Parents, but no spouse/civil partner or children: your estate is divided
    equally between your parents or given entirely to one parent if only one
    survives. </li>
  <li>Brothers and sisters only: your estate is shared equally among them, with
    the children of a deceased brother or sister taking his/her share. </li>
  <li>Nieces and nephews only: your estate is divided equally among those
    surviving. </li>
  <li>Other relatives only: your estate is divided equally between the nearest
    equal relationship. </li>
  <li>No relatives: your estate goes to the state. </li>
</ul><h3>The requirements of a valid will</h3>

<p>It is possible to draw up a will yourself or you can hire a solicitor to
help you. For a will to be legally valid, the following rules apply:</p>
<ul><li>The will must be in writing </li>
  <li>You must be over 18 (if you are or have been married you can be under 18)
  </li>
  <li>You must be of sound mind </li>
  <li>You must sign or mark the will or acknowledge the signature or mark in
    the presence of two witnesses. </li>
  <li>Your two witnesses must sign the will in your presence </li>
  <li>Your two witnesses cannot be people who will gain from your will and they
    must be present with you at the same time for their attestation to be
    valid. The witnesses' spouses/civil partners also cannot gain from your
    will. </li>
  <li>Your witnesses must see you sign the will but they do not have to see
    what is written in it. </li>
  <li>The signature or mark must be at the end of the will. </li>
</ul><p>These are legal requirements and if they any of them are not met, the will
is not valid. If you want to change your will after you make it, you can add a
codicil (amendment or change) to your will; this codicil must meet the same
requirements set out above. </p>

<h3>The format of the will</h3>

<p>You do not have to have your will in any set format. However, it is
important that the will has the following:</p>
<ul><li>Your name and address </li>
  <li>A statement that says you revoke or disown all earlier wills or codicils,
    such as "I hereby revoke all former wills and testamentary instruments made
    by me and declare this to be my last will and testament". </li>
  <li>A clause or section of your will that appoints one or more executors, or
    people who will carry out your wishes in your will after you die, and
    stating these executors' names and addresses. </li>
  <li>A residuary clause, which is a section in your will that sets out how
    property not effectively dealt with in the will should be distributed. This
    is important because specific bequests, such as "I leave x.. to Sean
    Murphy" can fail (be considered invalid), and then revert to the residue to
    be decided by this residuary clause. Your residuary clause could say that
    anything not covered in your will would be a gift or legacy to someone,
    like "The remainder of my estate I leave to my daughter, Mary". </li>
  <li>Your will should be dated and signed by you and your witnesses. Usually,
    these signatures are underneath a line in the will that states "Signed by
    the testator in the presence of us and by us in the presence of the
    testator". This statement is called "an attestation clause". An attestation
    clause is not a formal requirement of a valid will, but it is advisable to
    include it in your will as it constitutes evidence that your will has been
    validly executed. </li>
</ul><h3>What if the testator in unable to sign or make a mark?</h3>

<p>If you are unable to sign your will due to ill-health or illiteracy, it is
acceptable for you to sign your will by means of a mark. </p>

<p>If you are physically disabled to the extent that you are unable to sign or
mark your will, it is possible for you to direct an agent or representative to
sign your will for you. Your agent must sign the will in your presence and on
your direction and your two witnesses must be present. You then adopt this
signature as your own. </p>

<h3>The sound mind requirement</h3>

<p>In order to make a valid will, you must not only set out your wishes in a
written and witnessed document, but you must also have, in the eyes of the law,
the mental capacity to do so. This means you must make your will with
"understanding and reason" and not be suffering from mental conditions such as
delusion, insane suspicion or aversion. </p>

<p>It is your mental condition at the time you made your will is that legally
relevant. If you suffer from any mental disorder, it is important that evidence
is left with your will (for example, from a doctor) that proves you were
mentally competent at the time you made the will. Otherwise, your will can be
open to challenge. </p>

<p>Your will can also be challenged on the basis that you were acting under
pressure or undue influence when you made it so it is important that you get
independent legal advice and not use the services of a solicitor of any
potential beneficiary of your will. </p>

<h3>Changing or revoking your will</h3>

<p>If you want to change your will, you and your witnesses must sign or initial
the will in the margin of the page beside the changes. You can also change your
will in the form of a memorandum or written note that is signed by you and your
witnesses that refers clearly to the changes. </p>

<p>To change your will, you can also make a separate document, called a
<em>codicil</em>, which is like an update added to the end of your will. This
document, again signed by you and your witnesses, should set out clearly and
accurately the changes you want to make to your will. These changes are then
legally binding. </p>

<p>However, if you plan to make a lot of changes to your will, instead of
adding a codicil, it might be easier to simply revoke or disown your current
will and make a new one, using the same procedures.</p>

<p>It is always possible for you to revoke your will. This can only be
challenged if your mental capacity when you revoked your will is called into
question. </p>

<p>Your will shall be revoked automatically in certain situations:</p>
<ul><li>If you marry or enter into a civil partnership, your will shall be
    revoked, unless your will was made in contemplation of that marriage or
    civil partnership. </li>
  <li>If you make another will, the first will you made shall be revoked. </li>
  <li>If you draw up a written document that is executed in accordance with the
    requirements for a will, your first will shall be revoked. </li>
  <li>If you burn, tear or destroy your will, it will no longer be considered
    valid. Or, if you have someone else destroy it, your will shall be revoked,
    provided this was done in your presence, with your consent, and with the
    intention of revoking your will. </li>
</ul><h3>Legal rights of spouses, civil partners and children when there is a valid
will</h3>

<p>In general, you are free to dispose of your belongings or estate as you
wish, but your will is subject to certain rights of spouses/civil partners and
other more limited rights of children. These rights are set out below. </p>

<h4>Rights of a spouse or civil partner</h4>

<p>If you have left a will, and your spouse/civil partner has never renounced
or given up his/her rights to your estate, and is not "unworthy to succeed" in
legal terms, then that spouse/civil partner is entitled to what is called a
"legal right share" of your estate. This legal right share is:</p>
<ul><li>One-half of your estate if you do not have children</li>
  <li>One-third of your estate if you do have children</li>
</ul><p>Your spouse/civil partner does not have to go to court to get this share, as
any executor is obliged to grant this share where applicable. You can also make
a bequest in your will that increases your spouse's/civil partner's legal right
share, although if you do not specify that this gift is meant to be in addition
to his/her legal right share, the executor may consider it part of that share
and not an extra element to it. Your spouse/civil partner can choose to take
either the assets specified under the will or his/her legal right share. The
executors must inform your spouse/civil partner in writing of his or her right
to choose between these two options and your spouse/civil partner must exercise
this right within 6 months of receipt of notification or within 12 months of
the taking out of the Grant of Representation. </p>

<h4>Renouncing or losing rights under a will</h4>

<p>It is possible for a spouse/civil partner to renounce his/her rights to the
legal right share. This can form part of an agreement prior to marriage/civil
partnership, for example, in the case of a second marriage, or the spouse/civil
partner may set aside his or her rights in order to favour any children.
However, any such renunciation may be ignored in certain circumstances, for
example, if there is evidence of undue influence or evidence that the
spouse/civil partner did not understand what he/she was doing or did not have
independent legal advice. </p>

<p>If a couple is separated, a renunciation of each other's right to the legal
right share is usually included in a separation agreement. Divorce or
dissolution of a civil partnership, however, automatically ends succession
rights. </p>

<p>Cohabiting partners have no automatic legal right to each other's estates,
although under the <a href="../../birth_family_relationships/problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/redress_scheme_for_cohabiting_couples.html">redress
scheme for cohabiting couples</a> introduced by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Civil
Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010</a> a
qualified cohabitant may apply for provision to be made from the estate of a
deceased cohabitant. Cohabiting partners can make wills that favour each other.
These wills, however, cannot cancel out the legal rights of a spouse/civil
partner if someone is separated but not divorced or their civil partnership
dissolved.</p>

<p>Being judged "unworthy to succeed" is relatively rare, and would arise, for
example, if the surviving spouse/civil partner had murdered or committed
certain other serious crimes against the deceased. It could also apply if the
spouse/civil partner had deserted the deceased for at least two years before
death. </p>

<h4>Rights of children under a will</h4>

<p>Unlike a spouse/civil partner, children do not have any absolute right to
inherit their parent's estate if the parent has made a will. Children born
inside or outside marriage and adopted children all have the same rights and
there are no age restrictions. </p>

<p>However, a child may make an application to court if he/she feels that
he/she has not been adequately provided for. It is important to seek legal
advice before making such an application. An application must be made within 6
months of the taking out of a Grant of Representation. The court then has to
decide if the parent has failed in his/her duty to the child in accordance with
the needs of that child. Each case is considered individually, but it is
important to remember that the legal right share of the spouse cannot be
infringed in order to give the child a greater share of the estate. It can,
however, reduce the entitlement of a civil partner. </p>

<h4>The family/shared home</h4>

<p>The surviving spouse/civil partner may require that the family/shared home
be given to him/her in satisfaction of his/her legal right share, although if
the house is worth more than the legal right share, the spouse/civil partner
may have to pay the difference into the deceased's estate. A court may decide
that this sum does not have to be paid if it would cause undue hardship to the
spouse/civil partner or dependent children. </p>

<h3>Giving away property in order to disinherit</h3>

<p>If a court finds that the deceased person gave away property before he/she
died with the intention of defeating the interest of or unfairly reducing the
legal right share of a spouse/civil partner or child, a court order may be
issued to the person who received the property, making that person a debtor of
the estate, and requiring them to pay back an amount to the estate. </p>

<h3>Gifts that fail</h3>

<p>Remember that any legacy or gift in your will could fail for many reasons.
</p>
<ul><li>If your will states that you are leaving an asset to someone and you no
    longer have the asset or the asset no longer exists, then the gift fails,
    or is in ademption. </li>
  <li>If you leave a gift to a person who is a witness to your will. </li>
  <li>If the gift is not clearly identified in your will or it does not conform
    to its description in the will. </li>
  <li>Your gift lapses, or no longer applies, if the beneficiary dies before
    you do. If this happens or if the beneficiary refuses to accept the gift,
    your gift goes back to your residuary clause, or if you do not have one a
    residuary clause, into intestacy. Your gift will not lapse, however, if the
    beneficiary who dies is a child or other descendant of yours, such as a
    grandchild, but whose child (or other descendant) is still alive. In that
    case, the gift becomes part of your deceased beneficiary’s estate for
    distribution according to their will or intestacy. </li>
</ul><h3>How wills are interpreted</h3>

<p>Most wills are not disputed, but if there is a disagreement, it must be
settled in court. The court will give effect to the testator or will-maker's
wishes as expressed in the will. The testator's wishes are derived or taken
from a reading of the will as a whole, with words and phrases taken in their
ordinary meaning unless they are technical words and it can be assumed the
testator meant them to be taken in their technical meaning. Extrinsic evidence,
or evidence outside the will, such as letters or notes that refer to the will
in advance of its making, may be introduced to the court to explain more fully
the testator's intentions and to help ascertain the true meaning of the will.
Where two interpretations of a provision in the will arise, the court will lean
in favour of the interpretation that upholds that bequest. </p>

<p>Because wills can be disputed, it is important that you write your will in
simple, straightforward language. </p>

<h3>Property abroad</h3>

<p>If you have property in other countries, it is generally considered
advisable to make a will in each of those countries due to possible differences
in succession law. Under <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=cellar:57d89c1a-5220-4886-b7b5-6b140ce3cc85">EU
Regulation 650/2012 on matters of succession (Brussels IV)</a>, if you have
property in another EU member state, apart from the UK or Denmark, you can
direct in your will that the law of your nationality should apply to the
property.</p>

<h3>Status of wills as public documents</h3>

<p>After probate has been taken out on a person's will, that will then becomes
a public document and a copy of the grant and the will can be obtained by
anyone from the Probate Office or relevant District Probate Registry using <a href="http://www.courts.ie/Courts.ie/library3.nsf/(WebFiles)/0A39B0E864A6463980257DB80037302C/%24FILE/Form%20PAS1-%20Records%20Office%20Search%20Form%20-%20Dec%20%202014.pdf">Form
PAS1 (pdf)</a>. The grant sets out the name and address of the executor or
administrator of the estate and the name of the solicitor acting on their
behalf (if any). It also sets out the gross value and the net value of the
estate.</p>

<p>Detailed information about the estate is not normally available to the
general public, however, certain people may be able to inspect the Inland
Revenue Affidavit which contains the detailed information. They include:</p>
<ul><li>A beneficiary who is named in the will</li>
  <li>Someone who is entitled to a share of the estate</li>
  <li>A child who is entitled to bring proceedings against the estate under
    Section 117 of the Succession Act 1965</li>
</ul><p><a href="http://www.courts.ie/courts.ie/library3.nsf/pagecurrent/F2051BFE4462AAB3802575AF003E0ED0?opendocument&amp;l=en">Information
on obtaining a copy of a will</a> is available on the Courts Service website as
well as in the information notes of Form PAS1</p>

<p>The Probate Office also sends copies of the will, the Grant of
Representation and the Inland Revenue Affidavit to the Revenue Commissioners.
</p>

<h3>Will substitutes</h3>

<p>Joint bank accounts or joint ownership of property are valid ways of
deciding the fate of your assets in your own lifetime, but making a will can
eliminate most potential disputes. </p>

<h3>Joint bank accounts</h3>

<p>Where joint bank accounts are opened with a spouse/civil partner or child,
it is presumed that one party will be fully entitled to the money in the
account when the other party dies. Disputes can arise, however, if someone,
perhaps an elderly person or a person with a physical disability, opens a joint
bank account with a relative or friend so that the relative or friend can
manage his or her finances for him or her. This is because the owner's
intention may or may not have been to benefit the relative or friend. A
decision in such a case would depend on the intention of the people involved,
the amount they each lodged into the account and the terms of their contract
with the bank. It is advisable for people with joint accounts to make clear in
their contract with their bank or in their will what their intentions are for
the money in such accounts. </p>

<p>A solicitor will be able to help you draft a will or you can write it
yourself. </p>

<p>If you are an executor seeking probate, you may make a personal application
for a grant of probate to the Probate Office or to one of <a shape="rect" href="http://www.courts.ie/courts.ie/library3.nsf/pagecurrent/D6536B4B00396842802575AF003E0ECC?opendocument&amp;l=en#district_probate_registries">14
District Probate Registry offices</a>. You should go to the District Probate
Registry Office in the area where the deceased lived at the date of death. If
the deceased lived at the time of his or her death in Dublin, Meath, Kildare or
Wicklow or lived outside Ireland, application for a grant of probate must be
made to the Probate Office in Dublin.</p>

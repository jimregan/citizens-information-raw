<p>Many people have a role to play in providing appropriate assistance within
the first few hours following a death by suicide. These people include the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.garda.ie">Gardai</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../sudden_or_unexplained_death/coroners.html">Coroners</a>, health
professionals and funeral directors. If you are, or have been bereaved by
suicide you may experience a range of emotions including shock, disbelief,
guilt and anger. As suicide may occur unexpectedly or be very sudden, this
makes it traumatic for those left behind (particuarly for family and
friends).</p>

<p>Even though this is an extremely difficult time, there are important
practical and material matters that can and will arise after any death. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/publications/information/leaflets.html">Information
for the Bereaved</a> has been specially written to help guide you through all
the issues and all the stages. It contains information such as what to do
immediately after a death, possible social welfare entitlements, tax, financial
and legal issues that can and will arise. This booklet also contains
information about where to go for further information and support. </p>

<p>It's important to be aware that there are a range of organisations
throughout Ireland that can help if you have been bereaved through suicide or
if you find yourself in a supporting role to someone who has been bereaved in
this way. Each situation involving suicide is different and people react in
different ways. </p>

<p>If you are in a supporting role it is important to be extremely sensitive to
the needs of the bereaved person. It's also important to know that if you are
in a supportive role, there may come a time when you find that you can no
longer offer the level or standard of support that is needed. The following
organisations can help. They will offer you advice, information and support
during this very distressing time and can also help put you in touch with other
people in your area that have been through this experience.</p>

<h3>National Office for Suicide Prevention</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/Mental_Health_Services/NOSP/">National
Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP)</a> was established within the Health
Service Executive in 2005 to oversee the implementation of the first <a shape="rect" href="http://health.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/reach_out.pdf">National
Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention (pdf)</a>. NOSP supports the
implementation of the current national strategy, <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/Mental_Health_Services/NOSP/preventionstrategy/">Connecting
for Life</a>, and co-ordinates suicide prevention efforts around the country.
It also works closely with the Health Sevice Executive's Resource Officers for
Suicide Prevention.</p>

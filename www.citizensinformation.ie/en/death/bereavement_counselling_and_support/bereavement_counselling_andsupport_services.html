<p>Although everyone's personal reaction to a bereavement is different, most
people experience some of the following emotional responses when someone close
to them dies:</p>
<ul><li>Disbelief </li>
  <li>Shock </li>
  <li>Anger </li>
  <li>Sadness </li>
  <li>Relief </li>
  <li>Guilt </li>
  <li>Depression </li>
  <li>Anxiety </li>
  <li>Despair </li>
  <li>Longing </li>
  <li>Loneliness </li>
</ul><p>These emotions normally occur, however, some or more of these responses may
be experienced for differing lengths of time, depending on the individual. The
main initial responses to a death - even one that has long been expected - are
disbelief, shock and anger. These may lessen in time and can be followed by a
sense of guilt, depression, anxiety and despair. You may also feel an acute
sense of longing for the dead person, hopelessness at the thought of their
absence, loneliness and sadness at their loss or even a sense of relief that
they are gone (which may, in turn, lead to feelings of guilt).</p>

<p>Some physical symptoms experienced after bereavement can be quite acute and
distressing. It is important to realise that these are normal parts of the
grieving process and will pass in time. Physical reactions may include:</p>
<ul><li>loss of energy and interest in life </li>
  <li>an inability to sleep or constant tiredness </li>
  <li>poor concentration and forgetfulness </li>
  <li>loss of appetite or compulsive comfort eating </li>
  <li>a "frozen" inability to cry or a tendency to continuously burst into
    tears </li>
  <li>nausea and/or diarrhoea </li>
  <li>headaches and unexplained body pains </li>
</ul><p>Toddlers, young children, teenagers and adults all react to death very
differently. It can be very important to tell children about a death in a way
that they can handle at that particular age. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/publications/information/leaflets.html">Information
for those affected by Bereavement</a> is a publication produced by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/">Citizens
Information Board</a>. It provides information on dealing with the practical
and material matters that arise following a death.</p>

<p>The Irish Hospice Foundation provides a website, <a href="http://hospicefoundation.ie/bereavement/">BEREAVED.ie</a>, that provides
advice and information for bereaved people and those supporting them.</p>

country, both public and private, professional and voluntary, religious and
secular. If you are religious, there may be pastoral care available through
your local priest, order, minister, rabbi or congregation. You should make
contact through the relevant place of worship. </p>

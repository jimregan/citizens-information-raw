<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Death is an extremely difficult time in life where there are many decisions
to be made at a time of considerable personal stress. If you have recently lost
someone close to you or know someone who has recently been bereaved, there are
some immediate things that you must do following a death and some state and
voluntary services to support you. <br><br>
Whether a death is anticipated or unexpected, essentially the same steps are
followed concerning organising funeral arrangements, registering the death and
liaising with state services. <br><br>
The loss or death of someone they care for, can be deeply distressing for a
child. Irrespective of whether this loss was anticipated or sudden, children
deal with bereavement in different ways. Barnardos provides a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.barnardos.ie/what-we-do/specialist-services/bereavement-counselling.html">counselling
service for children who have lost someone close to them</a> which may be of
assistance. <br><br>
Sudden or unexpected deaths can be very difficult to deal with. There is <a shape="rect" href="bereavement_counselling_and_support/bereavement_counselling_andsupport_services.html">a
range of organisations that provide bereavement counselling services</a> to
anyone who has been recently bereaved. You may find these counselling services
useful during this difficult time. </p>

<h3>Immediately following the death </h3>

<p>It is necessary to make sure that everyone who dies is identified and the
cause of death is established. If a death occurred suddenly and unexpected, you
may need to notify the Gardai and the <a href="sudden_or_unexplained_death/coroners.html">Coroner</a>. <br><br>
You should also notify the next of kin, family doctor (GP) and the <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/registrar_birth_marr_death.html">Registrar of
Births, Marriages and Deaths</a>. If the deceased was an organ donor, you must
act quickly if you are their nearest relative. Read <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/blood_and_organ_donation/organ_and_body_donation.html">more about
organ and body donation here</a>. <br><br>
Funeral directors and undertakers deal with the arrangements regarding the <a href="after_a_death/burials.html">burial</a> or <a href="after_a_death/cremations.html">cremation</a>. They can organise
everything from the <a shape="rect" href="after_a_death/burials.html">burial
plot</a> to religious services if you wish. Read more about <a shape="rect" href="after_a_death/funerals.html">funeral services in Ireland</a> here . </p>

<h3>Registering the death</h3>

<p>To <a shape="rect" href="after_a_death_cert.html">register a death</a>, you
must bring a Death Notification Form stating the cause of death to the local
Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths. If the doctor did not see the
deceased at least 28 days before the death occurred or if the doctor is unhappy
about the cause of death, they must inform a <a shape="rect" href="sudden_or_unexplained_death/coroners.html">Coroner</a> who will decide if
a <a href="sudden_or_unexplained_death/postmortems.html">post-mortem</a> is
necessary. If after the post-mortem a cause of death cannot be established, an
<a shape="rect" href="sudden_or_unexplained_death/inquests.html">inquest</a>
may be held . <br><br>
If you are the parents of a stillborn child, you can read more in our document,
<a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/miscarriage_and_stillbirth/registering_stillbirth.html">Registering
the birth of a stillborn child</a>. </p>

<h3>Children </h3>

<p>If the bereaved include orphans under the age of 18 years, immediate
arrangements have to be made for them. Generally, family members take care of
orphan children until long-term arrangements are made. If there are no family
members to do this, the <a href="../birth_family_relationships/family_support_agency.html">Child and
Family Agency</a> needs to be informed and it will make any arrangements
necessary to care for the children.</p>

<h3>Access to money</h3>

<p>You may need to get access to the deceased person's money to help pay for
funeral expenses. It's not easy to get access to money in a bank or building
society unless it is in a joint account. If the money is in the deceased's name
only, then you usually can't get access to it until probate is taken out. (See
legal issues following a death below). <br><br>
There are a number of social welfare benefits and grants available following a
death that you may not be aware of. For example, you may be eligible for an <a href="../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/exceptional_needs_payments.html">Exceptional
Needs Payment</a> to help you with the cost of a funeral if your income is low.
You may also have questions about pension rights, insurance policies, <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/capital_taxes/capital_acquisitions_tax.html">taxation
of income and inheritance</a>. These issues are covered in our section on <a href="../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/death_related_benefits/">benefits
and entitlements relating to death</a>. The Revenue Commissioners have some
useful information on <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/personal/circumstances/bereavement/widows-widowers.html">taxation
following bereavement</a>. <br><br>
If you are experiencing financial difficulties following a bereavement, there
are supports such as the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.mabs.ie">Money Advice
and Budgeting Service (MABS)</a> available to help. MABS is a free,
confidential service staffed by trained money advisors who can provide advice
and assistance during this difficult time.</p>

<h3>Legal issues following a death</h3>

<p>There are a number of legal issues associated with a death. Our document, <a shape="rect" href="the_deceaseds_estate/what_happens_the_deceaseds_estate.html">What happens
the deceased person's estate</a> explains issues such as access to money, the
family home and legal right shares of children. <a shape="rect" href="before_a_death/power_of_attorney.html">Power of attorney</a> is a legal
device that can be set up during your lifetime, in the event you become
incapacitated or unable to deal with your affairs. Our document on <a shape="rect" href="the_deceaseds_estate/dealing_with_the_deceaseds_estate.html">dealing with
the deceased's estate</a> explains all about how to take out probate, duties of
executors and dealing with debt. </p>

<h3>Housing and daily living</h3>

<p>It's very important to notify some particular organisations in writing
following a death. If the deceased held a <a href="../housing/owning_a_home/help_with_buying_a_home/paying_for_a_home.html">mortgage</a>
you must get in touch with the financial institution where the deeds or
mortgage is held to notify them of the death. If the deceased lived in <a href="../housing/renting_a_home/">rented accommodation,</a> the landlord or
local authority needs to be notified so names can be changed on tenancy
agreements. </p>

<p>It's essential to get in touch with the deceased's bank or building society
to cancel any direct debits from any accounts and if the deceased held any
insurance policies, to notify all insurers. </p>

<p>It can be upsetting when bills, statementsor subscriptions arrive in the
name of a deceased person following a death. Cancel ongoing subscriptions and,
if the deceased lived alone, redirect any post to the executor or administrator
of the deceased's estate. </p>

<p>If the deceased held a <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/driver_licensing/full_driving_licence.html">driving
licence</a>, contact the <a href="https://www.ndls.ie/contact.html">NDLS</a>
and if they were in receipt of any benefits, contact the relevant government
department or agency. To remove the deceased's name from the <a href="../government_in_ireland/elections_and_referenda/voting/registering_to_vote.html">Register
of Electors</a> use Form RFA1, which is available from your local authority.
You can also get in touch with any social clubs and professional or trade
organisations. </p>

<p>A bereavement may leave dependants in short- or long-term financial need.
There are certain once-off payments in Ireland (provided by the Department of
Social Protection) that are available to help out families during this
difficult time.</p>

<p>You must fulfil certain PRSI requirements to be eligible for some of the
payments. You may be eligible for other payments if you pass a means test or if
you are in urgent need no matter what your means. If you have long-term needs,
you may qualify for short- or long-term social welfare payments or for Rent
Supplements </p>

<h3>Rent or mortgage payments</h3>

<p>If you have difficulty in paying your rent, you may be eligible for <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a>. Our document on <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/owning_a_home/buying_a_home/mortgage_protection.html">Mortgage
Protection</a> provides information on insurance that is designed to pay off
your mortgage in full. </p>

<h3>Short- or long-term social welfare payment</h3>

<p>You may also be eligible for continued payment of the deceased's social
welfare payment after his/her death or for a longer term social welfare
pension, allowance or payment. </p>

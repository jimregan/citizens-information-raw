<p>When someone in Ireland dies, it is their personal representative who
distributes their money and property according to the law. Occasionally,
difficulties can arise where a bereaved person may need to get access to some
of the deceased person's money to pay for funeral expenses. It may also
transpire for example, that a dependent spouse/civil partner or children may
need to get access for living expenses, at least until a social welfare payment
is awarded. It is not easy to get immediate access to the deceased person's
money unless it is in a joint account.</p>

<p>There are a <a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments_related_benefits/benefits_and_entitlements_following_a_death.html">range
of payments provided by the Department of Social Protection</a> that are
available to help out families during this difficult time. </p>

<h3>Money in the bank or building society</h3>

<p>If money in the bank/building society is in the deceased's name only, then
you usually cannot get access to it until probate is taken out. If the amount
of money is small, the financial institution may release it provided the
personal representatives or the next of kin sign an indemnity form. In effect,
this is a guarantee that the bank/building society will not be at a loss if
there are other claims on the money.</p>

<p>If the account is held jointly with a person other than the deceased's
spouse/civil partner (e.g. the deceased's brother or parent) talk to the bank
or building society. They may need a statement from the Revenue Commissioners'
Capital Taxes Office. This will allow you to transfer money while any possible
tax liability, such as <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/capital_taxes/capital_acquisitions_tax.html">Capital
Acquisitions Tax</a> (CAT), is being examined.</p>

<p>Spouses/civil partners are not liable for CAT on inheritances from each
other. You should apply to the Capital Taxes Office of the Revenue
Commissioners for a letter of clearance.</p>

<p>If you think the deceased person may have had a dormant bank account, you
should contact the financial institution at which the account was held. If that
financial institution no longer exists and you want to find out where to make
your enquiry or claim, you should contact the Banking and Payments Federation
Ireland (BPFI). <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/financial_institutions/dormant_bank_accounts_in_ireland.html">Find
out more about dormant accounts here</a>.</p>

<h3>Post Office savings</h3>

<p>For accounts in one name only:</p>
<ul><li>If the investor had left instructions on a 'nomination form', the
    proceeds of the savings deposit account or Savings Certificates (i.e the
    principal plus accrued interest) will be distributed according to those
    instructions. </li>
  <li>If the investor had made a will, the proceeds will be distributed in
    accordance with the will. </li>
  <li>If there is no will, the usual rules for inheritance will apply. </li>
</ul><p>Whether there is a will or not, you will need to obtain probate or
<em>Letters of Administration</em> from the High Court if the proceeds are more
than €10,000.</p>

<p>If the amount involved is less than €10,000, you will not have to wait to
take out a grant of probate. All you have to do is get a claim form from any
post office and send it with the following:</p>
<ul><li>Death certificate </li>
  <li>Post Office deposit book (keep a record of the number) </li>
  <li>Original will or certified copy of the will (this will be returned by
    registered post) </li>
</ul><p>to the Post Office Savings Bank, Deceased Section. You will be sent a form
of indemnity which you will have to sign before a Peace Commissioner or
Commissioner for Oaths, or GP, clergyman or member of the Garda Síochána.</p>

<h3>Credit union accounts</h3>

<p>If the deceased had a credit union account and had completed a valid
Nomination Form, when opening the account, nominating someone as next of kin,
the proceeds of the account up to a maximum of €23,000 go to the person or
persons nominated on the form. They do not form part of the deceased's estate.
</p>

<p>The balance of the account forms part of the deceased's estate and is
distributed in accordance with succession law.</p>

<h3>Insurance policies</h3>

<p>If an insurance policy names you as the beneficiary, then you may claim it
directly from the insurance company. You need a death certificate. If there is
no named beneficiary, then the proceeds form part of the overall estate of the
deceased and are distributed with the other assets. Find out about <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/insurance/insurance.html">different types
of insurance here</a>.</p>

<h3>Occupational and personal pensions</h3>

<p>The rules governing occupational and personal pensions vary. If the deceased
was a member of a pension scheme, you should contact the employer or former
employer or the scheme administrators to find out if there is a pension for the
spouse/civil partner and/or children. Self-employed people may have pension
arrangements which involve some of the investments becoming part of the
deceased's estate.</p>

<p>Divorced people and those whose civil partnership has been dissolved may
have access to some part of the pension scheme depending on whether or not a
pension adjustment order was made at the time of the divorce/dissolution.</p>

<p>The Pensions Authority have a series of leaflets on pension matters for
scheme members. There is <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/occupational_pensions.html">more
information on pensions here</a>.</p>

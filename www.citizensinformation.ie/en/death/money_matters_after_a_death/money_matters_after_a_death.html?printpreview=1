<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>When a person close to you dies, it can be difficult to deal with the many
things that have to be decided and done at a time of such considerable stress.
However, there are issues such as possible social welfare entitlements, tax and
other money matters that may need to be addressed.</p>

<h3>Access to money</h3>

<p>If you were married to, in a civil partnership or living with the deceased
you may need immediate access to the deceased's money. You may also be the
beneficiary of an insurance policy or entitled to a pension. You will find <a shape="rect" href="access_to_money_after_a_death.html">information on accessing
money here</a>.</p>

<p>If the deceased was getting a social welfare payment or you were claiming
for them as a dependant, or you were getting a Carer's Allowance to look after
them, it's important that you notify the Department of Social Protection of the
death. There are also <a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments_related_benefits/benefits_and_entitlements_following_a_death.html">payments
provided by both the Department of Social Protection and the Health Service
Executive (HSE)</a> that are available to help out families during this
difficult time.</p>

<h3>Tax</h3>

<p>There are specific rules about taxation in the year of a person's death, for
example, a tax refund may be due. There are also extra credits for widowed
parents in the years following the death of a spouse/civil partner. If your PPS
No. is the same as your spouse's number , but with a W at the end, <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">you
may need a new PPS No.</a> to claim new tax credits or refunds. <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs_following_a_death.html">Read
here for more information about tax in the year of death and the years
following a death</a>.</p>

<h3>Bills and loans</h3>

<p>You need to make sure that all your essential ongoing bills are changed into
your name (if not already so). A phone call is all that is needed for
electricity, gas and telephone accounts. If you have a mortgage or other loan
that was in joint names, again you will need to inform the lender of the
death.</p>

<p>Where personal loans are concerned, you are only liable for those debts that
you yourself have signed for. If you are having difficulty making the payments,
you should let the company know what has happened and ask for time to work out
what you can actually afford given your changed circumstances.</p>

<p>If you are asked to take over the payments on a loan in the sole name of the
deceased, you are not legally obliged to do so as this should be paid out of
the estate - seek advice from one of the agencies listed below if you are not
sure what to do.</p>

<h3>Deceased person's estate</h3>

<p>When a person dies, his/her property passes to his/her personal
representative. The personal representative then has the duty to distribute the
deceased's money and property in accordance with the law, the will - if there
is one - or the laws of intestacy if there is no will. Find out <a shape="rect" href="../the_deceaseds_estate/dealing_with_the_deceaseds_estate.html">how to
deal with the deceased person's estate here</a>. The rights of the <a shape="rect" href="../the_deceaseds_estate/what_happens_the_deceaseds_estate.html">spouse/civil
partner and children to inherit the estate are described here</a>.</p>

<p>If your deceased spouse/civil partner made a will you have an automatic
right to a share in the estate which is often called "a legal right share".
Find out more about <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/married_couples/marital_status_and_inheritance.html">marital
status and inheritance rights here</a>. If you are separated your inheritance
rights may have been renounced or extinguished. Once a decree of
divorce/dissolution is granted, inheritance rights are automatically
extinguished. Read about the <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/separation_and_divorce/succession.html">succession
rights following a separation or divorce</a> here.</p>

<p>Cohabiting couples in Ireland have no automatic right of inheritance on the
death of either partner. Here you can read about the <a href="../../birth_family_relationships/cohabiting_couples/inheritance_rights_and_unmarried_couples.html">inheritance
rights of cohabiting couples</a>.</p>

<h3>Dormant Accounts</h3>

<p>The deceased may have had an account in a bank or building society which had
not been used for some time. A dormant account is defined by the Dormant
Accounts Act 2001 as one where no customer-initiated transactions have taken
place within a 15 year period. If the financial institution concerned can't
contact the account owner in these circumstances, then the money in the account
is transferred to the Dormant Accounts Fund. The proceeds of life insurance
policies, which are considered dormant, are also transferred to the fund. The
funds are used to help alleviate poverty and provide services to people with
disabilities. Find out what you should do <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/financial_institutions/dormant_bank_accounts_in_ireland.html">if
you think the deceased had a dormant account here</a>.</p>

<h3>Dealing with the deceased's debts</h3>

<p>Any debts must be paid out of the estate before anything else. Where there
is not enough money in the estate to pay all outstanding bills or debts, those
concerning the funeral, administration of the estate and concerning the will
take priority, followed by debts that have security (such as housing loans) and
lastly unsecured debts (e.g. personal loans) Some debts may be covered by loan
protection insurance in the event of death (e.g. credit union loans).</p>

<p>If you are experiencing financial difficulties following a bereavement, it
is important to deal with these at an early stage as ignoring the problem will
only lead to matters getting worse.</p>

<p>You can get advice from your local Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS)
as to how to go about this. Each MABS is a free, confidential, independent
service staffed by trained money advisers. Contact details are available in
your local telephone directory or on their <a shape="rect" href="http://www.mabs.ie/">website (www.mabs.ie)</a>.</p>

<p>FLAC (Free Legal Advice Centres) is an independent, voluntary organisation
that operates a network of legal advice clinics throughout the country. These
clinics are confidential, free of charge and open to all. Contact your nearest
<a shape="rect" href="http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/">Citizens
Information Centre</a> for information on FLAC services in your area. FLAC also
runs an information and referral line during office hours for basic legal
information. </p>

<p>FLAC has produced a series of basic leaflets on various areas of law which
may be useful. These are available from your local Citizens Information Centre
and from FLAC or can be <a href="http://www.flac.ie/help/online/infoleaflets2014.html">downloaded from the
FLAC website</a>.</p>

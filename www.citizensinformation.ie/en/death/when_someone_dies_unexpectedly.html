<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>When someone dies a doctor must be satisfied about the cause of death before
they can certify it and the <a shape="rect" href="after_a_death_cert.html">death can be registered</a>. If the doctor
didn't see the deceased at least 28 days before the death occurred, or if they
aren't satisfied about the cause of death, the death must be reported to the <a shape="rect" href="sudden_or_unexplained_death/coroners.html">Coroner</a>. The
Coroner must also be informed if the deceased died as the result of an
accident, or in violent or unexplained circumstances. The role of the Coroner
is to investigate sudden and unexplained deaths so that the death can be
certified and then registered.</p>

<p>Usually the death is reported to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/law_enforcement/garda_siochana_national_police_force.html">Gardaí</a>,
who will inform the Coroner. The deceased may be taken to a hospital mortuary
until the Coroner makes a decision as to whether a <a shape="rect" href="sudden_or_unexplained_death/postmortems.html">postmortem examination</a>
(also called an autopsy) is needed. A postmortem examination is a medical
examination of the body carried out by a specially trained doctor called a
pathologist.</p>

<h3>Identification of the body</h3>

<p>If the Coroner decides a postmortem examination is needed, then a family
member may be asked to formally identify the body. They will be required to go
to the mortuary and identify the body to a Garda who is acting on behalf of the
Coroner. The Gardaí may require more information about the circumstances
surrounding the death.</p>

<p>Where there are multiple injuries or marked postmortem changes,
identification may be confirmed by a photograph or other means. In such cases a
family member is not required to view the body.</p>

<p>Where a Coroner has ordered a postmortem examination, the permission of the
family is not necessary.</p>

<h3>Release of the body</h3>

<p>The body will normally be released to the family immediately after the
postmortem examination has been completed. <a shape="rect" href="after_a_death/funerals.html">Funeral arrangements</a> should not be made
until the body is released or the Coroner has indicated when release will
occur. This is important at all times, but particularly so at public holiday
weekends. </p>

<p>If there is a criminal investigation, it may be necessary to have a second
postmortem examination or further investigations. In this case, the release of
the body and the funeral arrangements may be delayed.</p>

<h3>Registering the death </h3>

<p>The death can only be registered by the <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/registrar_birth_marr_death.html">Registrar of
Births, Marriages and Deaths</a> when the Coroner has issued a Coroner’s
Certificate to the Registrar. The Coroner will issue this after the postmortem
report is received or after an inquest is held. In the meantime the Coroner can
issue an Interim Death Certificate, on request, which is acceptable to the
Department of Social Protection for <a href="../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/death_related_benefits/">bereavement
grants and other benefits</a>.</p>

<h3>Inquest </h3>

<p>If a death cannot be explained by a postmortem examination, an <a shape="rect" href="sudden_or_unexplained_death/inquests.html">inquest</a> must
be held to establish the facts of the death, such as where and how death
occurred. Where an inquest is to be held, the Coroner is usually able to allow
<a shape="rect" href="after_a_death/burials.html">burial</a> or <a shape="rect" href="after_a_death/cremations.html">cremation</a> once the postmortem
examination of the body has been completed.</p>

<p>For some deaths, inquests are legally required. In other cases, the holding
of an inquest is at the discretion of the Coroner and the family can make their
views known to the Coroner, if they so wish. </p>

<p>The inquest will not take place until at least 6 weeks after the death. It
is a public enquiry, presided over by the Coroner (and in some cases involving
a jury) into the cause of the death. Witnesses may be required to attend the
inquest to give evidence regarding the circumstances and cause of the death.
The family are entitled to attend the inquest, but they are not legally obliged
to be there. </p>

<p>When a jury is present at an inquest, it is the jury rather than the Coroner
who delivers the verdict. Nobody is found guilty or innocent at an inquest and
no criminal or civil liability is determined.</p>

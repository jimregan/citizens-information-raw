<p>When a person dies, his/her property passes to his/her personal
representative. The personal representative then has the duty to distribute the
deceased's money and property in accordance with the law, the will - if there
is one - or the laws of intestacy if there is no will.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>A Testator is a person who has made a will. If you die without making a
will, you are said to die intestate. If that happens, your money and property
is distributed in accordance with the rules set out in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1965/en/act/pub/0027/index.html">Succession
Act, 1965</a>.</p>

<p>There are some restrictions on what you can do in a will. In general, you
may not completely disinherit a spouse/civil partner and, if you do, your
spouse/civil partner may claim his/her legal right share. You are not obliged
to leave any assets to your children but if you do not, they may be able to
make a claim on the basis that you have not fulfilled your obligations towards
them. Apart from that, you may dispose of your estate (estate is the term used
to describe all of your assets, your money, property, etc.) in whatever way you
like.</p>

<p>The <span>personal representative</span> is either:</p>
<ul><li>an executor or executors - this is a person or people appointed by the
    deceased person in his/her will. </li>
  <li>an administrator(s) - this is usually the next of kin or a lawyer. An
    administrator is appointed where there is no will, or where no executor is
    nominated in the will or where the executor has predeceased the testator or
    is unwilling or unable to act as executor. </li>
</ul><p>Entitlement to be appointed administrator is in the following order:</p>
<ol><li>Spouse or civil partner</li>
  <li>Child</li>
  <li>Parent</li>
  <li>Brother or sister</li>
  <li>More distant relative</li>
</ol><p>If there is doubt about who is entitled to be the administrator, the issue
is decided by the Probate Registrar.</p>

<p>It is the personal representative's responsibility to distribute the estate
in accordance with the will of the deceased and/or the law. </p>

<h3>Money in the bank</h3>

<p>If the money in the bank or the insurance policy is in the deceased's name
only then family members usually cannot get access until probate is taken out.
If the amount of money in the bank is small, the bank may release it provided
the personal representatives or the next of kin sign an indemnity form - in
effect, this is a guarantee that the bank will not be at a loss if there are
other claims on the money.</p>

<p>If the bank account is in the joint names of the deceased and the deceased's
spouse/civil partner, the money can usually be transferred into the survivor's
name. You will need the death certificate to do this. If there is an account
with more than €50,000, you will also need a letter of clearance from the
Revenue Commissioners allowing the money to be transferred into the surviving
spouse's/civil partner's name<a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/capital_taxes/capital_acquisitions_tax.html"></a>.
Spouses/civil partners are not liable for Capital Acquisitions Tax on
inheritances from each other. You should apply to the Capital Taxes Office of
the Revenue Commissioners for a letter of clearance.</p>

<p>If the bank account is in the joint names of the deceased and someone else,
and the bank was given instructions when the account was opened that the other
person was to receive the money on the death of the deceased, the money can be
transferred into the survivor's name. The death certificate will be required to
do this. If there is an account with more than €50,000, a letter of clearance
from the Revenue Commissioners will be required. allowing the money to be
transferred into the surviving spouse's/civil partner's name pending
investigations about liability to <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/capital_taxes/capital_acquisitions_tax.html">Capital
Acquisitions Tax (CAT)</a>. Where the bank has no instructions, it will be
necessary to establish what was intended to happen to the money on the death of
the deceased.</p>

<h3>Credit union accounts</h3>

<p>If the deceased had a credit union account and had completed a valid
Nomination Form, when opening the account, nominating someone as next of kin,
the proceeds of the account up to a maximum of €23,000 go to the person or
persons nominated on the form. They do not form part of the deceased's estate.
</p>

<p>The balance of the account forms part of the deceased's estate and is
distributed in accordance with succession law.</p>

<h3>Occupational and personal pensions</h3>

<p>The rules governing occupational and personal pensions vary with the
different pension arrangements. If the deceased was a member of a pension
scheme, you should contact the scheme administrators to find out if there is a
pension for the spouse/civil partner and/or children. Self-employed people may
have pension arrangements that involve some of the investments becoming part of
the deceased's estate.</p>

<p>Divorced people and those whose civil partnership has been dissolved may
have access to some part of the pension scheme depending on whether or not a
pension adjustment order was made at the time of the divorce/dissolution.</p>

<h3>The legal right share</h3>

<p>If there is a will and the spouse/civil partner has never renounced his/her
rights and is not "unworthy to succeed", then that spouse/civil partner has a
right to what is called a "legal right share" of the deceased's estate. </p>
<ul><li>If there are no children, the spouse/civil partner is entitled to
    one-half of the estate; </li>
  <li>if there are children, the spouse/civil partner is entitled to one-third
    of the estate. The children are not necessarily entitled to the rest. </li>
</ul><p>If you find that your spouse/civil partner has made a will that does not
recognise your legal right share, you may still claim your right. You do not
have to go to court; the executor or administrator is obliged to grant you your
share.</p>

<p><a href="../../birth_family_relationships/cohabiting_couples/inheritance_rights_and_unmarried_couples.html">Cohabiting
couples</a> have no legal rights to each other's estates but may be able to <a href="../../birth_family_relationships/problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/redress_scheme_for_cohabiting_couples.html">apply
for redress</a> when one of them dies. A church annulment has no legal status
and so does not change the status of a spouse. If a partner in such an annulled
marriage subsequently "remarries" or enters into a civil partnership, this is
not a legal marriage or civil partnership, and the parties have no rights vis a
vis each other. Cohabiting couples may, of course, make wills in favour of each
other but such wills may not negate the legal right share of a spouse/civil
partner.</p>

<h3>The family home</h3>

<p>If the family home is held by both spouses/civil partners as joint tenants,
the surviving spouse/civil partner automatically inherits the deceased
spouse's/civil partner's interest. In the case of a cohabiting couple where the
family home is held as joint tenants, the surviving partner automatically
inherits the deceased partner's interest but may be liable for inheritance tax,
unless the surviving partner qualifies for <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/capital_taxes/capital_acquisitions_tax.html">dwelling
house tax exemption</a>. Where both die at the same time so that it is not
possible to say who died first, property held as joint tenants is divided
equally so as to form part of each of their estates.</p>

<p>The surviving spouse/civil partner may require that the family home be given
to him/her in satisfaction of the legal right share or the share on intestacy.
If the family home is worth more than the legal right share then normally the
spouse/civil partner would have to pay the difference into the deceased's
estate. However, the surviving spouse/civil partner may apply to the court to
have the dwelling house given to him/her either without paying the difference
or by paying such sum as the court thinks reasonable. The court may make such
an order if it thinks that hardship would otherwise be caused either to the
surviving spouse/civil partner or to a dependent child.</p>

<h3>Renouncing or losing your rights under a will</h3>

<p>There are various circumstances in which a spouse/civil partner renounces
his/her rights under the Succession Act. Sometimes this might be done prior to
marriage/civil partnership or the spouse/civil partner may waive the right in
favour of a child or children. If the couple are separated, it is usual to
renounce rights to each other's estates in a separation agreement. A separation
does not always involve renunciation of succession rights. A
divorce/dissolution decree means the end of succession rights; the court, of
course, has the power to take the loss of these rights into account when
deciding on the financial settlement between the spouses/civil partners.</p>

<p>Being "unworthy to succeed" is relatively rare and would arise, for example,
where the surviving spouse/civil partner murdered the deceased or committed
certain other serious crimes against the deceased. It may also arise if you had
deserted your spouse/civil partner for at least two years before the death.</p>

<h3>Rights of children under a will</h3>

<p>Unlike a spouse/civil partner, children have no absolute right to inherit
their parent's estate if the parent has made a will. However, if a child
considers that he/she has not been adequately provided for, he/she may make an
application to court. The child need not be a minor or be dependent in order to
use this procedure. The court has to decide if the parent has "failed in his
moral duty to make proper provision for the child in accordance with his
means". Each case is decided on its merits and the court looks at the situation
from the point of view of a "prudent and just" parent. It is important to
remember that the legal right share of the spouse cannot be infringed in order
to give the child a greater share of the estate. It can, however, reduce the
entitlement of a civil partner.</p>

<p>Anyone considering challenging a will on these grounds should get legal
opinion before applying to the court. Children born within or outside marriage
have the same rights.</p>

<h3>Intestacy</h3>

<p>If a person dies without having made a will or if the will is invalid for
whatever reason, that person is said to have died "intestate". If there is a
valid will, but part of it is invalid then that part is dealt with as if there
was an intestacy. The rules for division of property on intestacy are as
follows:</p>

<p>If the deceased is survived by</p>
<ul><li>spouse/civil partner but no children - spouse/civil partner gets entire
    estate </li>
  <li>spouse/civil partner and children - spouse/civil partner gets two-thirds,
    one-third is divided equally between children (if a child has already died
    his/her children take a share) </li>
  <li>parents, no spouse/civil partner or children - divided equally or
    entirely to one parent if only one survives. </li>
  <li>children, no spouse/civil partner - divided equally between children (as
    above) </li>
  <li>brothers and sisters only - shared equally, the children of a deceased
    brother or sister take the share </li>
  <li>nieces and nephews only - divided equally between those surviving </li>
  <li>other relatives - divided equally between nearest equal relationship </li>
  <li>no relatives - the state </li>
</ul></div>

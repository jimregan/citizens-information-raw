<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>When someone dies abroad, particularly if the death was sudden or
unexpected, it is often difficult to know how to deal with the practical
matters you need to address. Every country has its own rules about the
formalities to be followed when someone dies. The purpose of the following
information is to set out the general process and rules involved when bringing
a body to Ireland for burial or cremation.</p>

<p>The information is aimed primarily at families of Irish citizens. Families
of non-Irish nationals should contact the relevant embassy for their own
country for advice, if they wish to bring a body to Ireland. A list of <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=376">foreign embassies
and consulates responsible for Ireland is available here</a>. You can <a shape="rect" href="sending_a_body_from_ireland_for_burial_or_cremation_abroad.html">read
about sending a body out of Ireland here</a>.</p>

<p>Repatriation of the remains of a deceased person to Ireland can be a
complicated and costly process. You may therefore wish to consider having the
body cremated abroad and having the ashes returned to Ireland.</p>

<h3>Notification that an Irish citizen has died abroad</h3>

<p>If the death of an Irish citizen is notified to the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=285">Irish embassy or consulate
abroad</a>, the Garda Sióchána in Ireland are asked to notify any
family/next-of kin in Ireland. The embassy/consulate can also help communicate
with the police or other authorities abroad.</p>

<p>If you have been notified of the death of an Irish citizen abroad by a tour
operator or by someone else, then you should contact the Irish
embassy/eonsulate for that country for advice.</p>

<h3>Formal identification of the remains</h3>

<p>Before any arrangements can be made to return a body to Ireland, it will be
necessary to have the remains formally identified. That is, it is necessary to
have the identity of the deceased officially confirmed in line with the laws in
that country. The rules on who may formally identify a deceased person can
vary, but usually identification may be carried out by a travelling companion
or business colleague of the deceased. Depending on local laws and rules
however, it may be necessary for a family member to travel to the place where
the deceased is, to confirm the identity.</p>

<p>Further information on the local arrangements for formal identification of
Irish citizens abroad is available from the Irish embassy for the country where
the death occurred. While the embassy may assist in obtaining documents such as
death certificates, etc. it cannot help pay for the cost of relatives
travelling to where a death occurs. Neither can the embassy pay the costs of
repatriation of bodies back to Ireland except in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<h3>Appointing a funeral director</h3>

<p>In order to obtain the release of the body for repatriation from the
authorities in the country where the person died, you should appoint a funeral
director in that country. A funeral director is someone whose business is to
prepare the dead for burial and to arrange and manage funerals. Services of
funeral directors are not free so you should check fees and costs associated
prior to engaging these services.</p>

<p>If you live in Ireland and contact a funeral director here, your funeral
director in Ireland can find a suitable funeral director in the other country
and make the appropriate arrangements. Alternatively, the Irish embassy for the
country can provide help to Irish citizens in appointing a local funeral
director. If the death occurred on a package holiday, the tour operator should
be able to help with arrangements.</p>

<p>The local funeral director can prepare the body for repatriation. The
funeral director can also prepare the appropriate documentation and obtain the
death certificate if possible. Assistance is also available from the Irish
embassy in obtaining documents such as the death certificate or medical
reports. The local funeral director can also make all the necessary flight
arrangements.</p>

<h3>Clearance from the coroner</h3>

<p>The repatriation of a body to Ireland must be notified to the coroner in
Ireland for the district where the body is being flown to. If you have
appointed a funeral director in Ireland, the funeral director will contact the
appropriate coroner with the required documentation. Usually, bodies being
repatriated to Ireland are flown to Dublin airport. In that case, it is the <a href="http://www.coronerdublincity.ie/">Dublin District Coroner</a> who must be
notified. The appropriate documentation in relation to the deceased has to be
made available to the coroner for clearance by the coroner's office. The
documentation required includes</p>
<ul><li>Medical certificate giving cause of death </li>
  <li>Certification as to whether a post-mortem examination has been carried
    out or not </li>
  <li>Authorisation to remove the body from the other country </li>
  <li>Certificate to the effect that the body is not coming from an area of
    infectious disease </li>
</ul><p>Where there are some concerns as to the circumstances of the death, the
coroner may direct that an examination of the body be carried out. <a shape="rect" href="../sudden_or_unexplained_death/coroners.html">Read more
about the powers of coroners here</a>.</p>

<h3>Funeral arrangements</h3>

<p>Funeral arrangements in Ireland should not be confirmed until the coroner's
office has cleared the documentation. International regulations (Article 3 of
the League of Nations International Regulations concerning the conveyance of
corpses, 1937 and the <a shape="rect" href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=080&amp;CM=1&amp;DF=10/11/2006&amp;CL=ENG">Council
of Europe Agreement on the Transfer of Corpses 1973</a>) require all coffins
crossing international frontiers by air or sea to be metal (zinc or lead) lined
and sealed. These coffins are therefore not suitable for cremation and either
the lining has to be removed or another coffin provided if the body is to be
cremated in Ireland. <a shape="rect" href="funerals.html">Read more about
funerals and cremations here</a>.</p>

<h3>Registering the death</h3>

<p>If the death is registered in the country where the person died, it is not
normally registered in Ireland. Where a system of registration does not exist
in that country or where it is not possible to obtain copies of the relevant
civil registration record (death certificate), you should contact the <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/registrar_birth_marr_death.html">General
Register Office in Ireland</a> to see if the death can be registered in
Ireland.</p>

<p>A death certificate is an important legal document, evidence of which is
frequently required in Ireland in order to deal with the deceased's estate,
access money, etc. Read more about <a shape="rect" href="../the_deceaseds_estate/dealing_with_the_deceaseds_estate.html">dealing

<p>Repatriation of a deceased person to Ireland can be very expensive,
depending on the distance to be travelled and other factors. Check whether the
person had travel insurance or private medical cover to help cover the costs.
Financial assistance with the cost of repatriation of a dead body is not
available from the Irish embassy.</p>

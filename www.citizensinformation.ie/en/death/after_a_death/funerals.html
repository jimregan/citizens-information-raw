<p>Funeral arrangements are usually made by the immediate family of the
deceased. The deceased may have left specific instructions about where to be
buried or cremated and what form the funeral service should take. Most people
respect the deceasedâ€™s wishes where possible.</p>

<p>If there is any dispute about who is entitled to make the arrangements or
about the precise arrangements, the personal representatives are entitled to
make the decisions. The <a href="../the_deceaseds_estate/what_happens_the_deceaseds_estate.html">personal
representatives of the deceased</a> are the executors of the will if there is a
will or the people entitled to administer the estate if there is no will. The
people entitled to administer the estate in the absence of a will are immediate
family members.</p>

<p>You can engage an undertaker or funeral director to deal with most aspects
of the funeral.</p>

<h3>Funeral director</h3>

<p>The Irish Association of Funeral Directors is the undertaker industry's
trade association. Members must follow its Code of Practice, which commits
members to:</p>
<ul><li>discussing and agreeing funeral director's charges with the next of kin
    in advance, unless expressly asked not to do this </li>
  <li>professionalism and quality of service in arranging and conducting the
    funeral </li>
  <li>openness about cost and payment </li>
  <li>accurate advertising of prices and services </li>
  <li>sensitivity, confidentiality and a commitment to leaving the customer in
    control of decisions. </li>
</ul><p>Individual funeral arrangements vary widely and depend on, among other
things, where the funeral is taking place, the type of coffin (casket) you get
and whether or not you hire funeral cars.</p>

<p>The funeral director's job may include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Discussing the family's and deceased's wishes and ensuring that all the
    details are taken care of and that the whole process goes smoothly </li>
  <li>Provision of the coffin, hearse, habit/shroud, limousine/transport of
    family and embalming </li>
  <li>Organisation of and payment for the grave purchase, grave
    opening/cremation charges, church offerings, newspaper announcements,
    flowers, music at the ceremony and catering. </li>
</ul><h3>Embalming</h3>

<p>Embalming is a process involving the replacement of all body fluids with a
substance designed to prevent the body from deteriorating. It is not strictly
necessary, especially if the removal and funeral take place relatively quickly
after death. About half of all bodies are embalmed.</p>

<h3>Burials</h3>

<p>Burial grounds (cemetaries) in Ireland are governed and maintained by local
authorities. The local authority then usually appoints a registrar or caretaker
for each burial ground to manage the sale of plots in that site and to maintain
the burial ground in some cases. </p>

<p>Prices for grave plots and burials in Ireland can vary a lot, so check
around for prices, if possible. You may like to <a shape="rect" href="burials.html">read through our document on Burial Grounds in Ireland</a>
here. </p>

<h3>Home burials</h3>

<p>It is possible to bury a loved one outside an official graveyard, for
example, on family land. However, it is very difficult to do so. It is very
wise to sort this out well in advance of the death, as it may be impossible to
organise legally at short notice. You will receive a visit from an
Environmental Health Inspector from the local authority's health department who
will ascertain that the proposed burial site will not pollute any water sources
or drainage channels and goes down to a depth of eight feet. </p>

<p>You should get in touch wtih <a shape="rect" href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">your
local authority</a> (County Council or Corporation) for further details.</p>

<h3>Cremation</h3>

<p>You can have the deceased's body cremated and dispose of the ashes by
burying them in a family plot, using facilities provided by the crematorium or
disposing of them privately.</p>

<h3>Funeral costs</h3>

<p>Funeral costs can vary widely depending on what you opt for and depending on
whether it is a city or country funeral (rural funeral costs are generally less
expensive). If you have difficulty paying for the funeral, your Department of
Social Protection's representative at your <a href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/otheroffice/community-welfare-office-contact.aspx">local
health centre</a> (formerly known as the Community Welfare Officer) <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/exceptional_needs_payments.html">may
be able to help</a>. </p>

<h3>Information for those recently bereaved</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/publications/information/leaflets.html">Bereavement
- information for those recently bereaved</a> is a publication from the
Citizens Information Board. This booklet is aimed at those who have been
recently bereaved and provides information and advice on the practical and
material matters that arise following a death. It contains information on what
to do immediately after a death, possible social welfare entitlements, tax,
financial and legal issues that may arise and where to go for further
information and support. </p>

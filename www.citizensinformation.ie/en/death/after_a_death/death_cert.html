<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>It is a legal requirement in Ireland that every death that takes place in
the State must be recorded and registered. Records of deaths in Ireland are
held in the General Register Office, which is the central civil repository for
records relating to Births, Marriages and Deaths in Ireland. You can apply for
a copy of a death certificate to any Registrar of Births, Marriages and Death
or to the General Register Office. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0003/index.html">Civil
Registration Act 2004</a> changed some of the rules about registering a death.
These changes took effect in December 2005.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>A death can be registered in the office of any <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/bdm/contactus/">Registrar of

staff of the hospital (if the death occurred in a hospital) or of your local
health centre, will be able to tell you where you can register the death. </p>

<h3>Registering the death</h3>

<p>To register a death, you must bring a Death Notification Form stating the
cause of death to any Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths. The staff of
the hospital (if the death occurred in a hospital) or of your local health
centre, will be able to tell you where you can register the death.</p>

<p>You can get the Death Notification Form from the doctor who attended the
deceased during their last illness. You must complete Part 2 of the Death
Notification Form. You must then sign the Register in the presence of the
Registrar. You will need to bring photo ID with you. This registration is
free.</p>

<p>A doctor must be satisfied about the cause of death before he/she can
certify it. If he/she didn't see the deceased at least 28 days before the death
occurred, or if he/she isn't satisfied about the cause of death, he/she must
inform a <a shape="rect" href="../sudden_or_unexplained_death/coroners.html">Coroner</a> who will decide
if a <a shape="rect" href="../sudden_or_unexplained_death/postmortems.html">postmortem</a> is
necessary. If the deceased died as the result of an accident, or in violent or
unexplained circumstances the coroner must be informed. </p>

<p>There may be a delay in registering a death where a postmortem is carried
out. The death is automatically registered where an <a shape="rect" href="../sudden_or_unexplained_death/inquests.html">inquest</a> or postmortem
is held at the request of the Coroner. The Coroner issues a certificate to the
Registrar containing all the details to be registered. </p>

<p>Deaths should be registered as <span>soon as possible</span> and no later
than 3 months from the date of the death. You will require the written
permission of the Registrar General to register any death that was not
registered within one year.</p>

<p>You should approach a maternity hospital or your local Registrar for
information on <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/miscarriage_and_stillbirth/registering_stillbirth.html">how
to register a stillborn child</a>.</p>

<h3>Getting a death certificate </h3>

<p>You can get copies of the death certificate from the Registrar when you are
registering the death. To obtain a copy of a death certificate at a later
stage, you can go directly to any Registrar's office. You can also apply for a
death certificate by post. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Apply-for-Certificates.aspx">An
application form for a copy of a death certificate</a> is available from the
General Register Office.</p>

<p>You can also <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/bdm/Certificates/">apply online for
a copy of a certificate</a>.</p>

<p>There is a reduced fee for those who need the death certificate for social
welfare purposes. You do not necessarily have to wait for the death certificate
before claiming social welfare benefits, as a copy of the death notice from the
newspapers will be accepted if there is a delay in getting the certificate.</p>

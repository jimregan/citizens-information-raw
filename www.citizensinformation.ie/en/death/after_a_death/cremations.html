<p>Cremation is an alternative to <a shape="rect" href="burials.html">burial</a> when someone dies. All Christian denominations
and most other religious sects around the world permit cremation. Some
religions (for example, Orthodox Judaism and Islam) do not.</p>

<p>There are a number of crematoria in Ireland (see 'Where to apply' below).
Access to these cremation facilities is not restricted to people living
locally. Anyone may arrange for a cremation to take place in any of these
crematoria.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you wish to arrange a cremation you should contact a <a shape="rect" href="funerals.html">funeral director</a> who will ensure that the statutory
(or legal) requirements are met. Before cremation, forms must be signed by a
medical referee who must be satisfied that the attending doctor viewed the body
before and after the death, completed the medical certificate and the necessary
form stating that there is no reason why the body should not be cremated. The
attending doctor is required to examine whether or not the death should be
notified to the <a shape="rect" href="../sudden_or_unexplained_death/coroners.html">coroner</a>.</p>

<p>There may be difficulties arranging an immediate cremation if the cause of
death is unclear. A coroner may in this case complete a Coroner's Cremation
Certificate which will allow the cremation to go ahead. In some cases, a Garda
Superintendent has the power to stop a cremation.</p>

<h3>Services</h3>

<p>Similar to burials, it is usual to hold an appropriate service in your local
church or place of worship. The coffin is then removed to the chapel in the
crematorium grounds, where a short committal service takes place (similar to
that at the graveside). The mourners take their seats in the chapel. The coffin
is then brought into the chapel and the service begins. At the end of the
service, the coffin is moved into the committal room and the mourners leave.</p>

<p>The form of the service depends on the religion of the deceased. You can
make other other arrangements however if you wish.</p>

<h3>Cremation</h3>

<p>After the committal service the coffin is taken from the committal room to
the crematorium building. The body, along with the coffin, is cremated on the
same day as the service. Crematorium regulations require that only combustible
materials are used in the manufacture of coffins for use in cremation. The Code
of Cremation Practice requires that the coffin is placed in the cremator in
exactly the same condition as that in which it arrived at the crematorium.</p>

<p>Only one coffin is cremated at a time. The only exceptions to this are in
cases where it is requested that both coffins are cremated together; for
example a mother and baby, or twin children.</p>

<h3>The ashes</h3>

<p>The ashes are available 24 to 48 hours after the cremation. You can make
arrangements through the funeral director or the crematorium for the remains to
be buried in the crematorium's garden of remembrance or placed in a niche in a
columbarium wall, if there is one. (A columbarium wall is a structure
containing small spaces where you can place cremated remains in urns, etc.).</p>

<p>Alternatively, the ashes can be removed in an urn which can be supplied by
the funeral director or the crematorium. You can then bury the remains in the
family grave or disperse them. If the dispersal is not on private ground,
permission should be obtained from the appropriate authority, for example, the
local authority.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l66096">Costs</h2>

<p>There is no significant difference between the cost of a burial and a
cremation, unless a new family grave has to be purchased for the burial. The
funeral director's charges are usually the same.</p>

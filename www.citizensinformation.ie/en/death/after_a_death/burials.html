<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Burial grounds (cemeteries) are the responsibility of the local authorities.
Many of them are operated by local authorities who appoint a registrar or
caretaker for each of their burial grounds to manage the sale of plots in that
site, and in some cases to maintain the burial ground. Parishes operate some
burial grounds while local groups also operate burial grounds. If you want to
purchase a burial plot, you can contact your local authority to get contact
details. However, many funeral directors offer to handle the purchase of burial
plots as part of their package of funeral services.</p>

<p>It is important to point out that many burial grounds or graveyards are
already full, and there may be restrictions on the pre-purchase or buying in
advance of burial plots, such as limiting advance buying to those over 65 years
of age.</p>

<p>All burials must be registered with the local authority and the location of
the grave noted. This is done by the people who manage the graveyard.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The main rules for burial grounds are set out in the Rules &amp; Regulations
for the Regulation of Burial Grounds 1888 and the relevant amending
regulations. Each local authority makes bye-laws in relation to the regulation
of burial grounds in their area. They cover various matters including the
allocation, size and purchase of burial plots, the recording of burials, the
maintenance of a register of burials, and the requirements regarding headstones
and monuments, as well the depth of burials and first interments.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2013/si/144/made/en/print">Burial
Ground (Amendment) Regulations 2013</a> amended the 1888 Regulations to allow
for uncoffined burials in an area of a burial ground designated exclusively for
that purpose.</p>

<h3>Looking after burial grounds</h3>

<p>Caretakers may be employed by the local authority to maintain the graveyard,
although many local authorities now encourage the establishment of voluntary
groups who maintain burial grounds in their area.</p>

<p>These groups are supported by many local authorities in the form of burial
ground maintenance priming grants. This grant helps towards the cost of the
groups' activities, which include grass cutting and planting in burial grounds,
weed control, and the construction and improvement of gates, entrances and
boundary walls.</p>

<h3>Gravestones</h3>

<p>It is possible to design a headstone yourself or hire a sculptor to make it
for you, but, in practice, the funeral directors you employ to look after
funeral arrangements will arrange the construction and installation of a
headstone themselves. It is necessary to obtain permission before erecting
headstones, but the funeral directors will arrange this also.</p>

<h3>Burial where the deceased has no means</h3>

<p>If someone dies without the means to pay for burial and if this person has
no traceable next of kin, it is the responsibility of the Department of Social
Protection or local authority to ensure that the person is buried in a
dignified manner that does not impinge on public health or public decency. The
Department or local authority will also be liable for the charges and costs
involved in doing so.</p>

<h3>Exhumation of the remains of deceased people</h3>

<p>It is only in strict circumstances that <a shape="rect" href="../sudden_or_unexplained_death/exhumation_of_the_remains_of_a_deceased_person.html">exhumation</a>
occurs. Some examples of situations where an exhumation of interred remains
from a burial ground might be required or take place include:</p>
<ul><li>For family reasons (if the family of the deceased person requests that
    the remains be moved to another burial ground, another part of the country
    or abroad)</li>
  <li>For public health reasons (for example, if a graveyard or cemetery is
    being moved)</li>
  <li>When a court orders an exhumation as part of a criminal investigation</li>
</ul><p>At all times during the process, due regard for respect to the deceased
person, other interred remains in the burial ground or graveyard and privacy of
the family and friends of the deceased person is protected.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Burial at Sea</h2>

<p>The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has developed <a href="http://www.dttas.ie/maritime/english/environment">guidelines</a> for
those considering burial at sea. These guidelines are based on previous
experience and seek to prevent distressing situations such as where a body is
returned to shore.</p>

<p>The guidelines recommend that you should consider the scattering of the
ashes at sea rather than burial.</p>

<p>In the event of burial, <a href="http://www.dttas.ie/maritime/english/environment">the guidelines</a> make
recommendations in relation to such matters as location of the burial, design
and construction of the coffin and preparation of the deceased.</p>

<p>For further information, the Department's Maritime Services Division can be
contacted at msd@dttas.ie or at the address below.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The cost of buying a burial plot varies. If you hire funeral directors to
arrange the purchase for you, they will indicate how much the burial plot costs
as part of the overall expense of a funeral. </p>

<p>If you wish to purchase a burial plot, you should start by contacting your

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>When someone from another country dies in Ireland there are certain
formalities that must be followed before the body can be sent out of Ireland
for burial or cremation elsewhere. The purpose of the following information is
to set out the general process and rules involved.</p>

<p>A funeral director in Ireland can help you deal with the formalities and can
make the necessary arrangements for 'repatriation'. Assistance is also
available from the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=376">relevant embassy representing
the person's country in Ireland</a>. If the death occurred on a package holiday
in Ireland, the tour operator should be able to help you with arrangements. A
funeral director from the person's country may also be able to arrange to have
the body returned home.</p>

<p>It can be very costly to have a body repatriated from one country to another
and you may wish to consider having the body cremated in Ireland and having the
ashes sent to the person's country. <a shape="rect" href="cremations.html">Read

<h3>Reporting the death</h3>

<p>When a sudden, unnatural or violent death occurs, there is a legal
responsibility on the doctor, Registrar of deaths, funeral director,
householder and every person in charge of any institution or premises in which
the deceased person was residing at the time of their death to report the death
to the coroner. The appropriate coroner is the coroner for the district where
the death occurred. The death may be reported to a member of the Garda
Síochána, not below the rank of sergeant, who will notify the coroner.
However, any person may notify the coroner of the circumstances of a particular
death. <a shape="rect" href="../sudden_or_unexplained_death/coroners.html">Read
more about the coroner in Ireland here</a>.</p>

<p>The coroner will arrange for the body to be moved to a mortuary facility and
for a medical examination (post-mortem) to be carried out to determine the
cause of death. The Garda Síochána will assist the coroner in arranging a
formal identification of the body by a family member or a relative.</p>

<p>Where a person dies from a natural illness or disease for which the deceased
was being treated by a doctor within one month of the death, there is no need
to notify the coroner. In this case, the doctor will issue the medical
certificate of the cause of death (Death Notification Form).</p>

<h3>Registering the Death</h3>

<p>When someone dies in Ireland the death must be registered as soon as
possible. Where the doctor issues the Death Notification Form, the death can
then be registered and a death certificate can be obtained from the local <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/bdm/contactus/">Registrar of
births, marriages and deaths</a>. A death is automatically registered where a
post-mortem is held at the request of the coroner however, there is likely to
be a delay in getting a death certificate. <a shape="rect" href="death_cert.html">Find out more about registering a death here</a>.</p>

<h3>Preparing the body for shipment home</h3>

<p>The funeral director you appoint in Ireland can embalm and prepare the body
for repatriation on funeral director's premises. Embalming helps preserve the
body. If a post-mortem has being held, the funeral director can obtain the
release of the body from the coroner so that it can be prepared. It is
necessary to have the body formally identified. This can be carried out by a
travelling companion or business colleague of the deceased. In some cases
however, it may be necessary for a family member to travel to confirm the
identification.</p>

<p>International regulations (Article 3 of the League of Nations International
Regulations concerning the conveyance of corpses, 1937 and the <a shape="rect" href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=080&amp;CM=1&amp;DF=10/11/2006&amp;CL=ENG">Council
of Europe Agreement on the Transfer of Corpses 1973</a>) require all coffins
crossing international frontiers to be zinc or lead lined and sealed. These
coffins are not suitable for cremation and either the lining has to be removed
or another coffin provided in the country of destination, if the body is to be
cremated.</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>Before a body can be removed from Ireland you require the following
documentation:</p>
<ul><li>Coroner's Removal Order/Non-infectious Note </li>
  <li>Embalming Certificate </li>
  <li>Passport or Identity Card </li>
  <li>Funeral Director's Declaration </li>
  <li>Embassy Permit </li>
  <li>Notarisation or apostilling of documents (where applicable) </li>
</ul><p>Your funeral director can obtain the Removal Order from the coroner and the
death certificate from the Registrar (if available). You need to find out from
the embassy what formalities and documentation are required. Your funeral
director can liase with the embassy on any formalities that need to be carried
out and in obtaining the required documentation.</p>

<h3>Travel arrangements</h3>

<p>You need to make travel arrangements for the body from Ireland to the
deceased's country. Your funeral director can arrange these. The body can be
flown home or it can travel by ferry and over land. While travelling over land
is cheaper, it also takes longer.</p>

<p>The embassy should be notified of the travel arrangements so that the
authorities in the deceased's country can be informed. Your funeral director
normally does this. You also need a funeral director in the deceased's country
who can liase with the relevant authorities there and arrange the removal of
the body for burial or cremation when it arrives.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l66096">Costs</h2>

<p>Repatriation of a deceased person abroad from Ireland can be an expensive
process due to factors such as the distance to be travelled and how the body is
shipped. Check whether the person had travel insurance or private medical cover
which would help cover the costs. If the deceased is covered contact the
insurance company as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Financial assistance with the cost of repatriating a deceased person abroad
<strong>is not available</strong> from the authorities in Ireland, just as it
is unavailable from the authorities in many other countries.</p>

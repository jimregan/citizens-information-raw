<p>An inquest is an official, public enquiry, presided over by the <a shape="rect" href="coroners.html">Coroner</a> (and in some cases involving a <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courtroom/jury_service.html">jury</a>) into the
cause of a sudden, unexplained or violent death. If a death cannot be
explained, an inquest may be held to establish the facts of the death, such as
where and how death occurred. An inquest would not normally be held if a <a shape="rect" href="postmortems.html">post-mortem examination</a> of the body
could explain the cause of death. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1962/en/act/pub/0009/sec0017.html#zza9y1962s17">Section
17</a> of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1962/en/act/pub/0009/index.html">Coroners
Act 1962</a> makes provision in law for the holding of an inquest into a death.
</p>

<p>The inquest will not take place until at least 6 weeks after the death. <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/witnesses/witnesses_introduction.html">Witnesses</a> may be
required to attend the inquest to give testimony on oath regarding the
circumstances and cause of the death. When a jury is present at an inquest, it
is the jury rather than the Coroner who delivers the verdict. Jury service at
an inquest is obligatory and a majority verdict is used to reach a verdict.
Nobody is found guilty or innocent at an inquest and no criminal or civil
liability is determined. There are no "parties" and all depositions, <a shape="rect" href="postmortems.html">postmortem reports</a> and verdict records
are preserved by the Coroner and are made available to the public. </p>

<p>An inquest is usually held in a courthouse, however, hotels or local halls
may also be used. The family of the deceased are entitled to attend the
inquest, but they are not bound by law or legally obliged to be there. If the
family attend the inquest, they do not require legal representation on their
behalf (that is, a solicitor or legal adviser). Sometimes however, if legal
action is being taken as a result of the death, the family may engage a
solicitor to attend the inquest and take notes. </p>

<p>When the proceedings have been completed, a verdict is returned in relation
to the identity of the deceased, and how, when and where the death occurred.
The range of verdicts open to the Coroner or jury (in jury cases, it is the
jury that returns the verdict) include accidental death, misadventure, <a shape="rect" href="../bereavement_counselling_and_support/support_services_for_those_affected_by_suicide.html">suicide</a>,
open verdict, natural causes and unlawful killing. </p>

<p>A general recommendation designed to prevent similar deaths occurring may be
made by the coroner or jury. When the inquest is completed, the Coroner issues
a certificate so that the <a shape="rect" href="../after_a_death_cert.html">death can be properly registered</a>. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If a death is due to unnatural causes, then an inquest must be held by law.
</p>

<h3>Jury at an inquest</h3>

<p>In certain circumstances, a jury must be present at an inquest. Every person
over the age of twenty-one years residing within a coroner's district is liable
to serve on the jury at any inquest held within that district unless they are
exempt. The inquest jury must consist of at least 6 people (and not more than
12 people). Circumstances where a jury is required at an inquest include
where:</p>
<ul><li>The death is due to murder, manslaughter or infanticide </li>
  <li>The death took place in prison </li>
  <li>The death was caused an accident, poisoning or a disease requiring
    notification to a government department or inspector </li>
  <li>The death was caused by a road traffic accident </li>
  <li>The death occurred in circumstances, which if they continued or recurred
    would endanger the health or safety of a member(s) of the public </li>
  <li>The Coroner considers that a jury is necessary. </li>
</ul><p>To attend as either a juror or witness at an inquest, you will receive a
summons served by a member of the Garda Síochána. This summons can be served
on you in a number of ways, for example, by delivering it to you directly or
leaving the summons with your spouse, child, employee or agent at your last
known residence or workplace as long as that person is not under 16 years of
age. Failure to attend at jury service at an inquest is an offence and you will
face penalties.</p>

<p>If the jury at the inquest fail to agree on the cause of death, the Coroner
can either accept the majority decision of the jury or if the decision is tied,
discharge the jury and hold a new inquest. </p>

<h3>Witnesses at an inquest</h3>

<p>The Coroner decides which witnesses should give evidence at the inquest and
the order in which they should give their evidence. Evidence must be presented
so as to provide a logical sequence of the circumstances surrounding the death.
The postmortem result establishes the medical cause of death.</p>

<p>Witnesses who are required to attend an inquest can claim for loss of
earnings and expenses. The rates for fees and expenses are set by statutory
instrument. </p>

<h3>Public attendance at an inquest</h3>

<p>All inquests are conducted in public and anyone may attend. Reports of
inquests may be carried in national and local newspapers but in practice only a
minority of inquests are actually reported. Coroners in Ireland are very much
aware of the tragic circumstances often involved in inquests and will try to
treat each inquest sympathetically. If there is a suicide note, its existence
will be acknowledged. At the discretion of the Coroner, its contents <span>may
be read out</span> in public. Every attempt is made to ensure that the inquest
proceedings are not unduly intrusive on families and friends concerned. </p>

<h3>Official reports of inquests</h3>

<p>As inquests are public enquiries, it is possible to obtain a copy of the
post-mortem report and any depositions taken at inquest, including a copy of
the verdict. These official reports are only available <span>after the inquest
has concluded</span>. There is a small fee for these documents. Inquest papers
are not available prior to the inquest being held.</p>

<p>A coroner is an independent official with legal responsibility for the
investigation of sudden and unexplained deaths. Coroners are appointed for
particular districts within a local authority area by the local authority (the
coroner for the Dublin district is appointed by the Minister for Justice and
Equality). While the coroner system is subject to the general supervision of
the Minister, coroners are independent in their function. The principal
legislation that governs the role and responsibilities of coroners is the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1962/act/9/enacted/en/html">Coroners
Act 1962</a> as amended.</p>

<h3>Role of the coroner</h3>

<p>The role of the coroner is to enquire into the circumstances of sudden,
unexplained, violent and unnatural deaths. This may require a post-mortem
examination, sometimes followed by an inquest. The post-mortem is carried out
by a pathologist, who acts as the coroner's agent for this purpose. The
coroner's inquiry initially is concerned with establishing whether or not death
was due to natural causes.</p>

<p>The coroner essentially establishes the "who, when, where and how" of
unexplained death. A coroner is not permitted to consider civil or criminal
liability; they must simply establish the facts. If a death is due to unnatural
causes, then an inquest must be held by law.</p>

<p>A coroner will not be involved in cases where a person died from a natural
illness or disease for which the deceased was being treated by a doctor within
one month prior to death. In this case, the doctor will issue the medical
certificate of the cause of death. The <a href="../after_a_death/death_cert.html">death can then be registered</a> and
a death certificate can be obtained.</p>

<h3>Sudden death</h3>

<p>In cases of sudden, unnatural or violent death, there is a legal
responsibility on the doctor, registrar of deaths, funeral undertaker,
householder and every person in charge of any institution or premises in which
the deceased person was residing at the time of their death to report such a
death to the coroner. The death may be reported to a member of the Garda
Síochána not below the rank of sergeant who will notify the coroner. However
under common law, any person may notify the coroner of the circumstances of a
particular death.</p>

<p>The Garda Síochána will assist the coroner in arranging a formal
identification of the body by a member of the family or a relative of the
deceased. The Gardaí will send the coroner a report on the circumstances of
the death. The fact that relatives may be met at the hospital by a uniformed
Garda, or that a Garda may call to the home to take a statement, does not mean
that the death is regarded as suspicious. The Gardaí will in most cases be
acting also as coroner's officers.</p>

<h3>Cause of death</h3>

<p>In situations where a medical certificate of the cause of death is not
available, the coroner will arrange for a <a href="postmortems.html">post-mortem examination of the body</a>. If the
post-mortem examination shows that death was due to natural causes, and there
is no need for an inquest, a Coroner's Certificate will be issued to the
Registrar of Births and Deaths who will then register the death and issue the
death certificate.</p>

<p>If death is due to unnatural causes, the coroner is obliged to <a href="inquests.html">hold an inquest</a>. The death will be registered by
means of a Coroner's Certificate when the inquest is concluded (or adjourned in
some cases).</p>

<p>Prior to the inquest (or while waiting for the post-mortem report), the
coroner's office will provide an Interim Certificate of the Fact of Death,
which may be acceptable to banks, insurance companies and other
institutions.</p>

<p>Coroner districts (there is one coroner per district) are roughly equivalent
to local authority districts. (However, in some cases, there are a number of
coroners in the same county). <a href="http://www.coroner.ie/en/CS/Pages/Coroner%20Contact%20Details#Dublin">Contact
information for the coroner for your district</a> as well as information on the
Coroner Service is available at <a href="http://www.coroner.ie/">coroner.ie</a>.</p>

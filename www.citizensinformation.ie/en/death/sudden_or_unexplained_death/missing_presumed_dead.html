<p>As in other countries, many people go missing in Ireland every year. While
the majority are safely reunited with with their families, a small minority
remain on the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=85">Garda National Missing
Persons List</a>. For those left behind, this can be a very difficult time. The
following information explains the legal situation regarding the estate and
possessions of a missing person. </p>

<p>If someone in Ireland is thought to be dead but there is no body (for
example, because a person was lost at sea), all of their assets and property
are normally frozen and cannot be used by anyone. Two exceptions to this are
where the property is jointly owned or where someone has <a shape="rect" href="../before_a_death/power_of_attorney.html">Power of Attorney</a> to deal
with their property or money in their absence.</p>

<p>Normally, you will not be entitled to a <a shape="rect" href="../after_a_death_cert.html">Death Certificate</a> or to any pension, life
insurance or bereavement-based social welfare payment in respect of the person
who is missing/believed dead . However, there are two exceptions to this.</p>

<p>The first exception is in the case where there is strong evidence that the
missing person is, in fact, dead. Normally, an inquest cannot be held unless
there is a body. However, under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1962/en/act/pub/0009/sec0023.html#zza9y1962s23">Section
23</a> of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1962/en/act/pub/0009/index.html">Coroners
Act 1962</a>, a Coroner may make a submission to the Minister for Justice and
Equality requesting an inquest if he/she has to reason to believe that a death
has occurred in or near his/her district in such circumstances that an inquest
is appropriate even though the body may have been destroyed (for example, in a
fire) or be unrecoverable (for example, after a drowning). If the Minister
thinks it proper, he/she may direct an inquest to be held in relation to the
death. A Garda report of the accident is usually submitted and if the verdict
by the <a shape="rect" href="coroners.html">Coroner</a> is that the missing
person is dead, the person can legally be presumed dead and the death can be
registered. Only then can the person's property be distributed, his or her life
insurance and pension paid out, and their dependants be entitled to
bereavement-related social welfare payments. </p>

<p>While there is no Irish legislation, the general rule in all other cases
(where an inquest cannot be held) is that an application can be made to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/high_court.html">High Court</a> once
the person has been missing for seven years or more. It may not always be
necessary to wait for seven years before applying if there is a very clear
implication from the circumstances that the person is dead. The High Court will
then examine the situation, and if it finds (on the balance of probabilities)
that the person is more likely to be dead than alive, a declaration will be
made that the missing person is legally to be presumed dead. Once the High
Court declaration has been obtained, the person's property may be distributed,
life insurance and pension paid out, and the bereavement-related social welfare
payments paid to entitled dependants.</p>

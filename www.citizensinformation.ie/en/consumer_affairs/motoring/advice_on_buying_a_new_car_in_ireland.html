<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>Generally, when you buy a new car you buy directly from a dealer or a
garage. You will have a consumer contract with this dealer or garage. Under
this contract you have the right to buy a car that is of merchantable quality,
as described and fit for its purpose. This means that if there is a fault with
the car after you have bought it, the business with whom you have the contract
(i.e. the car dealer or garage) must put things right by either repairing the
fault or replacing the car. In an extreme situation they may also refund you
the cost of the car.</p>

<p>These rules apply only to someone buying a car for their own personal use
from someone whose normal business it is to sell cars. If you buy a commercial
vehicle (a van, a truck or a tractor) you may not have the same rights as when
you buy a car for personal use.</p>

<p>There are additional costs associated with buying a car which you should be
aware of before you buy. When budgeting for a car you should take into account
that you will need to pay for motor insurance, motor tax, repairs and servicing
as well as petrol/diesel. A car with a small engine will cost less to tax,
insure and run so keep these factors in mind when you are buying.</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>

<p>Often when you are buying a major item like a car you will need help to
finance the purchase. You may decide to buy a car on <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/loans_and_credit/hire_purchase.html">hire
purchase</a> or <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/loans_and_credit/borrowing_money_in_ireland.html">borrow
money</a> to help pay for the car. You should always shop around for the best
deal and remember that there is more than one way to finance the cost of a new
car. Before getting a loan you should read the <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/">Competition and Consumer Protection
Commission (CCPC)</a> website on <a href="http://www.nca.ie/nca/car-finance">buying a car - your finance
options</a>.</p>

<p>If a garage or dealer is offering to arrange finance, they are acting as a
credit intermediary and they may be earning commission by arranging your credit
for you. The CCPC regulates credit intermediaries and all credit intermediaries
must hold an authorisation. Contact the CCPC to find out if the garage that you
are dealing with is registered with them.</p>

<p>If you choose to buy a car on hire purchase ensure that you are getting a
hire purchase deal and not a <a href="../consumer_protection/consumer_rights/consumer_hire_agreements.html">consumer
hire agreement</a>. When you buy a car on hire purchase ownership of the car
passes to you only after you have paid the final instalment. In the case of
consumer hire agreement ownership never passes to you. After signing a credit
agreement you have a ten-day <span>cooling off period</span>. Some garages may
ask you to sign away this right but you should think carefully about this
before you waive this right.</p>

<h3>Legal requirements when buying a car</h3>

<p>If you import a car to Ireland or buy a new car in Ireland you need to
ensure that your car is registered and you may be obliged to pay Vehicle
Registration Tax. In addition you need to ensure that you have adequate <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/motor_tax_and_insurance/motor_insurance.html">motor
insurance</a> and you need to pay <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/motor_tax_and_insurance/motor_tax_rates.html">motor
tax</a> annually. You can find out more about what you need to do in our
documents on <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/buying_or_selling_a_vehicle/buying_a_new_car.html">buying
a new car</a> and <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/coming_to_live_in_ireland/importing_car_into_ireland.html">importing
a car into Ireland</a>. If you live in another country and wish to buy a car in
Ireland you can register the car here temporarily. You can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/leaflets/information-note-zz-system-temporary-registration.html">read
about the strict rules that apply to temporary vehicle registration here</a>.
</p>

<p>All cars in Ireland need to reach a certain standard of safety and need to
be roadworthy. The <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/vehicle_standards/national_car_test.html">National
Car Test</a> ensures that all vehicles meet certain standards. A new car will
need to be tested once it has reached 4 years of age. </p>

<p>If you buy a car and wish to drive it immediately you should ensure that you
have <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/driver_licensing/categories_of_motor_vehicles_and_minimum_age_of_drivers_in_ireland.html">the
relevant driver’s license for the car</a>.</p>

<h3>Vehicle labelling</h3>

<p>Since July 2008, a labelling system allows consumers to compare the carbon
(CO2) emissions of new cars. The first section of the label shows the emission
bands and identifies the band for the particular vehicle to which a label is
attached. The second section of the label provides three important points of
information for consumers:</p>
<ul><li>The amount of fuel required to run the vehicle over 18,000 kilometres</li>
  <li>The annual motor tax payable</li>
  <li>The rate of VRT payable on the vehicle</li>
</ul><p>The third section of the label supplements the information provided in the
first and second sections, and introduces the importance of driving behaviour.
The remaining sections of the label provide essential information on the actual
vehicle to which it is attached, including make, model, engine capacity,
transmission, fuel type and consumption. An <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Environment/Atmosphere/FileDownLoad,17584,en.pdf">example
of a label is available here (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Speedometers should show speeds in kilometres per hour</h3>

<p>Since January 2005 all speed limits on road signs in Ireland are expressed
in kilometres rather than miles. Drivers need to know what their speed is in
kilometres and most new vehicles sold measure speed in both miles per hour and
kilometres per hour. Almost all new vehicles on the market since January 2005
have speedometers marked in kilometres per hour.</p>

<h3>Trade-ins</h3>

<p>You may have an older car to trade-in and you should consider what different
garages are offering for your car. Again, shopping around for the best price
for your trade-in car is the best option. Get independent advice as to what
your car is worth before trading it in. A garage or dealer is likely to pay
less for it than it’s worth on the open market, as they have to cover costs
in selling it on. You may consider selling the car for a higher price by taking
out a small advertisement in a newspaper. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you have a problem with a new car that you have bought you should firstly
bring the car back to the garage or dealer who should be able to repair any
problems that you have. New car distributors usually have comprehensive
customer procedures to deal with customer problems. Further advice may be
sought from the Society of the Irish Motor Industry. </p>

<p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission will give you information
on what your rights are should you need it. It has also published <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nca.ie/media/GuidetoBuyingaCar1.pdf">A Guide to
Buying a Car (pdf)</a> for consumers purchasing new or second-hand cars which
is available on its website or by phoning its helpline.</p>

<p>Hiring a car in Ireland or on holidays can be a great way to travel around
this or another country without having to buy a car. You may also need to hire
a van or a larger vehicle so that you can transport large items. Normally
consumers have no problems renting vehicles but there are ways to minimise any
risk of car hire problems.</p>

<p>When you rent a car a contract is created between you and the car rental
company. Read the car hire contract and ask about anything that you don’t
understand. Make sure that you understand the Terms and Conditions before you
accept the contract. If you are booking a rented car on-line often the Terms
and Conditions can be contained under other headings such as Frequently Asked
Questions or Requirements. Be clear what your obligations are under the
contract covering vehicle rental. </p>

<p>If you are renting a vehicle on-line or by telephone a <a shape="rect" href="../consumer_protection/consumer_rights/distance_selling.html">‘distance
contract’</a> is created that deals with the provision of transport services.
Normally when you buy a product or a service on-line you have a 7 day period to
change your mind about the deal. There are exceptions to this and the provision
of transport services such as issuing of airline tickets is one. When you rent
a vehicle on-line you do not have a 7-day period in which to change your mind
about any booking that you have made.</p>

<p>If you are under 25 or over 70 years of age check that you will be able to
rent a car as age limits apply in the case of car rental. Most countries,
especially other EU member states will accept a current valid national
driver’s license. Check to see if you need more documentation than this –
such as <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/driver_licensing/international_driving_permit.html">an
international driver’s permit</a>.</p>

<p>You may deal with a car hire broker who will take over renting a car for
you. Make sure that you are happy that you are dealing with an appropriate car
rental company. Also make sure that you are not paying more in broker’s fees
than you need to.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The contract regarding the car rental is not made when you book a car to
rent but when you pick up the car. Make sure that you understand what your
obligations are both at the time of booking and when you pick up the car. Also
be aware of what you need to do to drop back the car without incurring extra
charges. This may include returning the car with a full tank of fuel. </p>

<p>Sometimes you can be given a diagram of the car with the exterior damage
marked on it - be sure that all damage that is on the car is marked before you
drive it away. You may be charged for any damage that is not marked on the
diagram or damage report.</p>

<p>You may arrive at night when you cannot properly inspect the car that you
are about to hire ask for a torch or flash light so that you can give the car a
thorough check before you accept the vehicle. </p>

<p>Do the following checks on the car before you drive the car away from the
depot</p>
<ul><li>Tyres – ensure that they are inflated and in good repair – remember
    to check the spare tyre as well </li>
  <li>Tools – check that, at the very least, there is a jack and a wrench to
    replace a tyre should you get a puncture. Also make sure that you have all
    the necessary safety equipment needed for the area in which you are
    travelling. </li>
  <li>Fuel – ask if the car runs on petrol or diesel, you may be liable for
    putting in the wrong type of fuel. Generally, you need to refill the
    vehicle before you return it so ensure that you have a full tank of petrol
    when you start. </li>
  <li>Lights – ensure that your lights are all working adequately – this
    includes indicators break lights and fog lights. </li>
  <li>Windscreen – even the smallest flaw in a windscreen can lead to a large
    crack so give the windscreen a thorough check and ask for any flaws to be
    repaired. Make sure that the wiper blades and the windscreen wash system is
    working adequately. </li>
  <li>Insurance – check that you have the appropriate insurance – if you
    and another person will be driving check that you are both insured. If you
    are offered a reduction in price for not having particular cover (such as
    collision damage) think carefully about what this means before waiving this
    cover. Also clarify how this discount works – for example, do you need to
    leave a deposit in case you cause damage to the car in a collision. </li>
</ul><p>If you plan on taking a rented car across a national border ask the car
rental company if this is possible before you cross the border.</p>

<p>When you return the car to the car rental company make sure that you have
the car checked while you are there. This may mean that you avoid charges being
put on your credit card for damage that you did not know about. Even though you
may have purchased a damage waiver, car rental companies may charge your credit
card for any excess amounts that may apply. It is important, therefore, to have
the vehicle inspected on return and have any damage noted.</p>

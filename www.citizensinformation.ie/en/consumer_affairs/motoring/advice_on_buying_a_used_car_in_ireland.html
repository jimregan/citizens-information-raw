<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>It is often a lot cheaper to buy a second hand car (even if it is only one
or two years old) as the value of a new car depreciates very quickly. There are
many different ways to buy a second hand or used car – here are the three
main ways</p>
<ul><li>From a garage or car dealer </li>
  <li>At a car auction </li>
  <li>Through a small advertisement on the internet or in the papers </li>
</ul><h3>From a garage or car dealer</h3>

<p>In this situation you, as a consumer, are protected by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1980/en/act/pub/0016/index.html">Sale of
Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980</a> as you are buying a car for your
personal use from a person whose normal business it is to sell cars. As a
consumer you have the same rights if you buy an item second hand as if it is
new. In this case if you find a fault with the car after you have bought it the
dealer is the person who must set matters right. If you buy a commercial
vehicle or a tractor from a dealer you may not have the same protection under
the law. If you are offered an extended warranty on a used car think about the
cost of the warranty versus the cost of repairs that the car is likely to
need.</p>

<p>Sellers have responsibilities such as giving accurate and truthful answers
to the questions you ask. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/buying-car-dealer-private">Information on a
seller's responsibilities in car deals</a> is available on the Competition and
Consumer Protection Commission's website. </p>

<h3>At a car auction</h3>

<p>Often you can find very good bargains at car auctions which are held quite
frequently. However, the auctioneer cannot be held responsible for any defects
found after you have bought the car. Auctioneers have terms and conditions for
making sales and by bidding at an auction you are signifying that you accept
these terms and conditions. Before you go into an auction ensure you know what
these terms and conditions are and that you agree to them. It is important when
buying at auction that you know what you are doing as there is little legal
protection for the buyer of a car, or any other item, at auction.</p>

<h3>Through a small advertisement</h3>

<p>Vehicles are often advertised by private individuals on the internet and in
the ‘small ads’ section of newspapers. If you buy a car from a small
advertisement or on the internet from a private individual you are generally
not buying from a person whose normal business it is to sell cars (although
sometimes used car dealers do advertise in this way). Again in this case you
have very little legal protection if you find that the car that you have bought
is faulty. It is therefore important when buying from a private seller to
protect yourself from unscrupulous people. It may be worthwhile to employ the
services of a trusted mechanic who may be able to advise you on the mechanical
state of the car. </p>

<p>The seller is required to give you accurate and truthful information in
answer to any questions that you ask. However, a private seller does not have
to provide information that is not requested. If you have a grievance after
buying a car you should complain to the seller first. If you are not satisfied
with the response you may be able to take legal action against the seller. </p>

<h3>Importing a car to Ireland</h3>

<p>You may have found a car that you would like to buy in another country.
There are certain procedures to follow if you want to bring this car with you
back to Ireland. You can find out more in our document on <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/coming_to_live_in_ireland/importing_car_into_ireland.html">importing
a car from another country</a>.</p>

<h3>Change of Vehicle Ownership</h3>

<p>If you sell or trade in your car you should register this change of
ownership with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport or, if the car
was originally registered on or before the 1st of January 1993 you should
contact your local motor taxation office. <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/buying_or_selling_a_vehicle/change_of_ownership.html">You
can read more about change of ownership of a vehicle here.</a></p>

<h3>NCT Certificates</h3>

<p>Since 2002 all cars over a certain age, with a few exceptions, must pass a
test that ensures that cars are safe and roadworthy. This test is called the
National Car Test (NCT) and all cars over 4 years of age need to be tested,
they then need to be tested every 2 years after that. Cars over 10 years old
are tested each year. Ensure that any used car that you buy has passed the test
and has a valid certificate to prove it. You can <a href="../../travel_and_recreation/vehicle_standards/national_car_test.html">read
more about the NCT here</a>.</p>

<h3>Commercial vehicles</h3>

<p>If you are buying a used commercial vehicle, check that the vehicle has a <a href="http://www.cvrt.ie/en/Certificate-of-Roadworthiness/Pages/default.aspx">Certificate
of Roadworthiness (CRW)</a>. The CRW disc should be displayed on the windscreen
of trucks, buses, vans and jeeps, and as close as possible to the registration
plate of goods trailers.</p>

<p>If a commercial vehicle does not have a CRW disc displayed, it may mean that
the vehicle has not passed its annual <a href="http://www.cvrt.ie/en/About-CVRT/Pages/What%20is%20the%20CVRT.aspx">commercial
vehicle roadworthiness (CVR) test</a>. The CVR test history remains with the
vehicle regardless of change of ownership, therefore, if the vehicle has a poor
test history, you may get a CRW with a short expiry date when it is next
tested. You can find out when a vehicle is due its CVR test on the <a href="http://www.cvrt.ie/">cvrt.ie</a> website by selecting ‘Check my
CRW’.</p>

<p>Since 11 May 2016 the current odometer reading and up to 2 prior readings
from the previous test dates are printed on the Certificate of Roadworthiness
that comes with the CRW disc. You should request a copy of the CRW certificate
from the seller to check the historic odometer readings.</p>

on buying a used commercial vehicle</a> is available on cvrt.ie.</p>

<h3>Hire purchase on second hand vehicles</h3>

<p>In all <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/loans_and_credit/hire_purchase.html">Hire
Purchase agreements</a> the car remains the property of the finance company and
ownership of the items does not pass to the hire purchaser until the final
instalment is paid. If you have found a used car that you like, before you buy
it ask if it was previously bought on Hire Purchase. You should ensure that all
Hire Purchase payments have been made on the car so the car belongs to the
seller and not the finance company. It is possible to check if the car you are
intending to buy is still under a Hire Purchase agreement - this service is
offered by various companies online. It is also possible to check other aspects
of the vehicle's history online, including taxation and NCT history and whether
the car was previously written off.</p>

<h3>Driving legally</h3>

<p>To be able to drive the car in a public place the following is required:</p>
<ul><li>Legal <a href="../../travel_and_recreation/vehicle_standards/vehicle_registration_numbers.html">vehicle
    registration plates</a></li>
  <li>Current <a href="../../travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/motor_tax_and_insurance/motor_tax_rates.html">motor
    tax</a> disc displayed on the windscreen</li>
  <li>Current <a href="../../travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/motor_tax_and_insurance/motor_insurance.html">motor
    insurance</a> disc displayed on the windscreen</li>
  <li>Current NCT certificate (if car is over 4 years old) displayed on the
    windscreen</li>
</ul></div>

<p>Before you buy a used car you can check the vehicle's history online; there
are a number of companies providing this service.</p>

<p>If you have a problem with a used car that you have bought you should, in
the first instance, bring the car back to the garage or dealer who should be
able to repair any problems that you have. If you have done this and are still
dissatisfied you can then take your complaint further. If the dealer is a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.simi.ie/Find+a+Member.html#NewHeight=1032">member
of the Society of Irish Motor Industry</a> you can use their <a shape="rect" href="http://www.simi.ie/Consumer+Information/Consumer+Services/Contact+Complaints+Service.html">Investigation
and Complaints service</a>. You need to contact the SIMI within three months of
the fault becoming apparent.</p>

<p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission will give you information
on <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/cars-rights-wrong">what your rights are
if you buy a faulty vehicle</a>. </p>

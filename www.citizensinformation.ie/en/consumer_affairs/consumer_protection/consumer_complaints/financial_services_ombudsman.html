<p>A financial service provider in Ireland is a firm that deals with saving
money, insurance, banking, stockbroking or other financial service. If you have
a complaint about a financial service provider you should begin by complaining
directly to the person that you would normally deal with in the firm. If you
are not satisfied with how your complaint is dealt with you can make a more
formal complaint to senior management at the financial service provider. The
Competition and Consumer Protection Commission provides <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nca.ie/nca/financial-complaints">information on how to
complain about financial service providers</a>. You can <a shape="rect" href="how_to_make_a_consumer_complaint.html">read more about effective ways to
make a complaint here</a>. If you are still not satisfied that your complaint
is being dealt with fairly by the firm, you may take your complaint to the
Financial Services Ombudsman.</p>

<p>The Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau was established under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0021/index.html">the
Central Bank and Financial Services Authority Ireland Act 2004</a>. The Bureau
commenced it's work on 1 April 2005. The Financial Services Ombudsman is an
independent officer whose remit is to investigate, mediate and adjudicate
unresolved complaints of customers about financial service providers. </p>

<p>The Ombudsman for the Credit Institutions and the Insurance Ombudsman of
Ireland schemes are now part of the Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau. Any
complaints that were made to either of these offices before the Bureau was
established will be carried forward.</p>

<p>The Office of the Pensions Ombudsman will continue to deal with any
complaints about <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/occupational_pensions.html">occupational
pension schemes</a> or <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/personal_retirement_savings_accounts.html">Personal
Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs)</a>. You should submit a complaint you may
have about the way that a scheme is being administered to the Pension
Ombudsman. You can <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/ombudsman_for_pensions.html">read

<h3>Who can complain to the Financial Services Ombudsman’s Bureau?</h3>

<p>All personal customers of regulated financial institutions can make
complaints to the Financial Services Ombudsman’s Bureau. People who have been
offered services or have sought the provision of service from the financial
institution can also make complaints to the Bureau. The Financial Services
Ombudsman’s Bureau will also receive complaints from small businesses (i.e.
companies with an annual turnover of less than 3,000,000 euro). </p>

<h3>What companies can the Financial Services Ombudsman’s Bureau
investigate?</h3>

<p>The Bureau will investigate complaints against Banks, Building Societies, <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/financial_institutions/credit_unions.html">Credit
Unions</a>, Stockbrokers, Insurance Companies (life and non-life), Bureaux de
Change, Investment Product Intermediaries, Moneylenders and Designated
Investment Companies, Credit Intermediaries (for example, garages that offer
finance on new or used cars), Pawnbrokers and Hire Purchase Companies. Certain
Mortgage Lenders and the <acronym title="Voluntary Health Insurance">VHI</acronym> may also be investigated by
the Bureau if there is a complaint made against them. Since 7 February 2013, it
cannot pursue complaints against the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC)
without the consent of the High Court.</p>

<h3>Time limits for making a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman</h3>

<p>A six year limit applies to all cases so the Ombudsman will not investigate
any case arising from events that happened over six years ago. </p>

<h3>The Financial Services Ombudsman Council</h3>

<p>The Ombudsman works under Regulations made by the Financial Services
Ombudsman Council with the prior approval of the Minister for Finance. The
Council appoints the Ombudsman and consists of members of the financial
services industry and consumer representatives. The Council also prescribes
limits on the amount of awards that can be granted.</p>

<h3>Awards</h3>

<p>The Ombudsman can make awards up to certain limits (250,000 euro).
<span>Awards are binding on both parties</span>. These awards can however, be
appealed to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/high_court.html">High Court</a> by either the
financial institution or the consumer who took the complaint.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>You may engage a <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a> or any other
professional to help you with your application to the Bureau. Costs associated
with hiring a professional under these circumstances are your own
responsibility.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Many professions and skilled groups have professional bodies to represent
their interests. Most of these organisations maintain professional standards
either through the provision of training or the accreditation of new
professionals. Some have mechanisms for investigating complaints where their
members do not adhere to the required professional standards. Some have
statutory responsibility for investigating such complaints.</p>

<p>If you have a complaint about a member of one of the following professions
it is worthwhile to contact the relevant representative organisation which may
be able to help you. </p>

<h3>Solicitors</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.lawsociety.ie/">The Law Society</a> is the
statutory regulatory body for solicitors. It makes regulations on among other
things, standards and conduct. It administers a compensation fund for losses
suffered by clients through defaulting solicitors. It has appointed an
Independent Adjudicator.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.lawsociety.ie/Public/Complaints-against-solicitors/Independent-Adjudicator/">Independent
Adjudicator of the Law Society</a>’s role is to ensure that complaints about
the conduct of a solicitor are dealt with fairly and impartially by the Law
Society. The Adjudicator cannot investigate at first hand a complaint about a
solicitor. </p>

<p>Complaints about solicitors provided by the Legal Aid Board should be made
as per the <a href="http://www.legalaidboard.ie/lab/publishing.nsf/content/customer_charter_complaints">Legal
Aid Board's complaints procedure</a>.</p>

<h3>Barristers</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.lawlibrary.ie">The Bar Council</a> controls
and regulates the professional conduct of barristers. </p>

<h3>Teachers</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.teachingcouncil.ie/">Teaching
Council</a> maintains a register of teachers and regulates the teaching
profession and the professional conduct of teachers. It does not become
involved in day-to-day contractual or disciplinary matters or complaints which
can be dealt with more appropriately at local level. The Council’s role is
limited to issues of serious professional misconduct or cases where a teacher
is the subject of a criminal conviction. Such issues may lead to withdrawal of
registration on a temporary or permanent basis. The Teaching Council provides

<p>The rights of consumers of goods and services are protected by law. The
Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is an independent body,
established on 31 October 2014 under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0029/index.html">Competition
and Consumer Protection Act 2014</a>, with responsiblity for providing advice
and information to consumers. In addition, the CCPC is responsible for the
enforcement of a wide range of consumer protection laws. Some of these consumer
protection laws include: </p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="../consumer_rights/consumer_advertising.html">laws
    on deceptive trading practices</a>, </li>
  <li>restrictive practices, </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../travel/package_holidays.html">package
    travel</a>, </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../consumer_rights/unfair_terms.html">unfair
    contract terms</a>, </li>
  <li>timeshare, </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../product_safety_and_labelling/safety_of_products_for_sale.html">consumer
    safety</a>, (mandatory standards), </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../product_safety_and_labelling/standards_for_product_labelling.html">food
    labelling</a>, </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../product_safety_and_labelling/standards_for_product_labelling.html">product
    labelling</a>, </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../pricing/pricing_of_goods_and_services.html">unit
    pricing</a> and </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../pricing/price_display_of_goods_and_services.html">price
    displays</a>. </li>
</ul><p>The CCPC does not have a supervisory role in relation to financial services;
this area is covered by the <a shape="rect" href="../../financial_services/financial_products/financial_regulator.html">Central
Bank of Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>You may complain to the CCPC about false or misleading claims about goods,
services and prices and the CCPC may prosecute the traders concerned or apply
for a court order to get misleading advertisements withdrawn or amended. The
CCPC does not have a role in obtaining redress for you but sometimes, if a
trader is fined, the fine may be awarded to you.</p>

<p>If you suffer a loss or damage as a result of a false or misleading claim
about goods or services, you should seek redress from the trader and, if
necessary, you may sue for damages in the normal way through the courts.</p>

<p>The CCPC monitors the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1980/en/act/pub/0016/index.html">Sale of
Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980</a> and may prosecute traders for
breaches of the law. This Act gives you various rights in respect of the goods
or services that you buy or rent for private use, e.g., you are entitled to
expect that the goods are of merchantable quality, fit for their purpose,
etc.</p>

<p>If the goods do not meet these requirements, it is up to the seller to put
matters right. The seller may then pursue the manufacturer but that is a matter
between the seller and the manufacturer. You as the consumer have rights
against the seller and the seller has the duty to rectify the matter. You must
pursue this yourself, if necessary through the courts.</p>

<h3>European Consumer Centre (ECC)</h3>

<p>ECC Ireland provides a free information and advice service on consumer
rights under EU law. ECC Ireland can also help solve cross-border disputes
regarding goods and services. It is part of an EU-wide network and is jointly
financed by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/european_government/eu_institutions/european_commission.html">European
Commission</a>. Read more about <a shape="rect" href="../consumer_rights/consumer_rights_and_cross_border_shopping_in_the_european_union.html">consumer

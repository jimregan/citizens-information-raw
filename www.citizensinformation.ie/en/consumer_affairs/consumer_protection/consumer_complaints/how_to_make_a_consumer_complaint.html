<p>When you buy goods or services in Ireland or another EU Member State you
will have certain rights under consumer legislation. It can be difficult
sometimes to know where to complain or to whom you should address your
complaint. There are <a shape="rect" href="../consumer_rights/consumer_protection_organisations.html">a number of
consumer organisations in Ireland and throughout the EU</a> that provide advice
on your rights. In the interests of good customer service the majority of
businesses will be pleased to set any matter right. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Know what your rights are</h3>

<p>Before you make a complaint <a shape="rect" href="../consumer_rights/consumers_and_the_law_in_ireland.html">be aware of
your consumer rights under the law</a>. If you have a written contract or
description of the goods or services read what it states. Your complaint will
almost certainly be much more effective if you are aware of your rights.
Remember: A repair, a replacement or a refund are all possible options where
goods are faulty.</p>

<h3>Deal with the issue as soon as possible</h3>

<p>If a product is defective it is important that you return it as soon as
possible after you notice the fault. If you keep a faulty item for a long time,
you may be considered to have accepted the item in that state. The situation is
similar for services that you are unhappy with. In some cases, there are time
limits for taking certain procedures (for example, if you have a complaint
about a package holiday you need to complain to the tour operator within 28
days of returning from the holiday). Even where there are no time limits set
down, it is easier for you and the organisation to deal with recent events.</p>

<h3>Find and keep all relevant documents</h3>

<p>It is important to keep any documents relating to your complaint. You may
need these records later if you take your complaint to another authority to
solve it. It is also useful to keep track of the steps you took to address this
complaint. That means keeping receipts or cheque-stubs as proof of purchase for
the products or services. If you are complaining by telephone, make sure you
record details of the calls. That is, keeping track of whom you spoke to, what
was agreed, etc. If your complaint is in writing, keep records of what you
write, send photocopies of receipts and keep originals. </p>

<h3>Proof of purchase</h3>

<p>It is your responsibility to prove that you bought the goods or services
that you are complaining about. A receipt is just one way to prove that you
bought an item or paid for a service. If you paid for the item by credit card,
you could use your credit card statement as proof of purchase. A cheque stub
can also be used as proof of purchase. If you do pay for an item in cash, ask
for a receipt and keep it safe. A receipt issued following a cash transaction
is your only record that you have bought an item.</p>

<h3>Start at the least formal level</h3>

<p>You should begin by making your complaint informally. This means giving the
retailer or service provider the first opportunity to solve the problem. It is
advisable to speak to a 'decision-maker' such as a supervisor or a manager who
may have the authority to give you a refund or replacement. If informal contact
with the business doesn't work you should next put your complaint in writing.
It may be useful to check in advance if the business has a specific customer
complaint form for you to fill in. When you put your complaint in writing,
remember to be clear and state all the facts of the case. Remain objective and
avoid giving personal opinion, or comments. If direct contact with the company
does not work to your satisfaction, you should then complain to the appropriate
complaints body if there is one. Escalating a matter is considerably easier
when you have exhausted less formal routes. You may also find that many
consumer organisations cannot help with a problem if you have already taken the
case to a solicitor. Exhausting less formal routes also demonstrates that you
took all reasonable steps to redress your complaint before complaining
formally. It also demonstrates that the retailer had a number of opportunities
to put matters right before you chose to escalate them. </p>

<h3>Refunds/credit notes/vouchers</h3>

<p>If you buy faulty goods and you complain successfully to the retailer you
are entitled to a replacement, a repair or a refund. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1980/en/act/pub/0016/index.html">The Sale
of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980</a> does not state how a refund
should be made. The retailer or supplier of services can give a refund in cash,
cheque or a refund to a credit card account. The retailer could also issue a
credit note. Remember: A repair, a replacement or a refund are all possible
options where goods are faulty. <a shape="rect" href="replacements_refunds_and_credit_notes.html">Read more about Refunds,
Credit notes and Vouchers here.</a> </p>

<h3>Appropriate complaints body</h3>

<p>If you are still unhappy after you have complained to the retailer or
service provider, you may need to go to a complaints body. In some areas, there
is no specific body to deal with your complaint and your only recourse is to
the Courts, particularly the Small Claims Court. </p>

<p>There are a number of consumer complaints bodies in Ireland and abroad that
protect your rights. Some of these bodies are based in law, others are
regulated by the industry, others are voluntary organisations. Some consumer
complaints bodies have the power to prosecute offenders, others have the power
to make recommendations or non-binding directions. </p>

<p>If you are unsure of your rights, get help from the various information
sources listed in <a shape="rect" href="../consumer_rights/consumer_protection_organisations.html">consumer
protection organisations</a>. An <a shape="rect" href="alternative_dispute_resolution_in_ireland.html">Alternative Dispute
Resolution</a> Body may also be able to help you. In some cases, there is no
relevant complaints body and you may then have to consider taking a case to the
<a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/small_claims_court.html">Small
Claims Court</a>. </p>

<h3>If you have bought on hire purchase (HP) or under a consumer hire
agreement</h3>

<p>Anything you buy under a hire purchase (HP) or a consumer hire agreement
must be of <span>merchantable quality</span>, <span>as described</span> and
<span>fit for its purpose</span>. In other words, consumer rights in this
situation are the same as as if the goods were purchased outright. If you are
dissatisfied with goods received under a consumer hire agreement, you should
make your complaint to the retailer who sold you the goods. You may also be
able to make a complaint to the finance company. If you are unhappy with the
retailer's response, you should contact the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/">Competition and Consumer Protection
Commission (CCPC)</a>. The <a href="http://www.financialregulator.ie/Pages/home.aspx">Central Bank of
Ireland</a> is responsible for the regulation of credit institutions and has
implemented a <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/consumer/cpc/Pages/home1.aspx">Code of
Conduct</a> for credit institutions. </p>

<h3>Consumer complaints in the EU</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../consumer_rights/consumer_rights_and_cross_border_shopping_in_the_european_union.html">European
legislation protects you every time you shop in Ireland or in another EU Member
State</a>. Consumers can benefit by availing of cheaper prices and better
selection of items that the single market provides. Consumer problems that
arise when you shop across borders are often more difficult to resolve than
problems with local suppliers. Language differences and distance make it more
difficult to complain effectively. The European Consumer Centre (ECC) in
Ireland is there to support you if you have a problem with a supplier of goods
or services in another EU Member State. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.eccdublin.ie">ECC Ireland</a> provides a free information and
advice service on consumer rights in the EU. It is part of an EU wide network
of consumer centres and it can help you to solve consumer disputes arising in
other member states of the EU. It does this by trying to solve the dispute
directly with the provider of goods or services and, if this fails, by
referring your case to an alternative dispute resolution body. </p>

<h3>Where should I complain?</h3>

<p>If you have an issue with your service provider, you should first contact
your provider, outline your complaint and ask for it to be resolved. It is
important to act quickly and be aware of any time limits that may apply to
making a complaint. Your provider should have a code of practice for handling
complaints. </p>

<p>Try to be clear about the issue by providing enough details when making the
complaint to your service provider. Record the date and time that you make your
complaint and ask for a reference number for your complaint. Make a note of the
name of the person who takes your complaint.</p>

<p>Give your service provider a chance to resolve your complaint. Make a note
of any commitments that are made by your provider.</p>

<p>ComReg provides <a shape="rect" href="http://www.askcomreg.ie/tell_us/complaints_and_queries.51.LE.asp#L312">further
information to assist you when making a complaint</a> to your
telecommunications or postal service provider on its consumer website <a shape="rect" href="http://www.askcomreg.ie">www.askcomreg.ie</a>. </p>

<p>Advice for consumers on <a shape="rect" href="http://www.phonesmart.ie/Complaints/87#.VMD8tURF1Mw">making a complaint
about premium rate telephone services</a> is also available on ComReg’s
website. </p>

<h3>Who can complain to ComReg?</h3>

<p>If you have used your service provider's complaint procedure and you are not
satisfied with the outcome, you can complain to ComReg. ComReg cannot act on a
consumer complaint until the service provider’s complaint handling process is
completed.</p>

<p>The issue giving rise to your complaint must have occurred within the
previous 9 months for telecommunications issues. However, you must make your
complaint within 3 months of the use of a premium rate service.<br></p>

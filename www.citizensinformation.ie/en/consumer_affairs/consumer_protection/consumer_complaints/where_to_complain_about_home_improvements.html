<p>Here you will find information on the various organisations that deal with
trades and professions involved in home building or home improvements in
Ireland. Many professions are involved in home improvements and the major ones
are listed here. Many service suppliers are not members of any trade or
professional body and you may not be able to complain to any of these
organisations. The best way to ensure that you get the service that you are
looking for is to follow the advice given in our document <a shape="rect" href="../consumer_rights/your_rights_when_you_buy_a_service.html">Your rights
when you buy a service</a>. Consumer contracts are protected by <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1980/en/act/pub/0016/index.html">the Sale
of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980</a>. If you have a contract with a
service supplier you can expect that:</p>
<ul><li>The supplier has the necessary skill to provide the service </li>
  <li>The service will be provided with proper care and diligence </li>
  <li>The materials used will be sound and that goods supplied with the service
    will be of merchantable quality </li>
</ul><p>In a service contract, at the very least, you should ensure that you know
the price of the service and the time that it will take to complete the agreed
work. </p>

<p>Currently there are no representative bodies for plumbers. However, if you
are installing or working on a gas heating system or cooker it is important for
your safety that you get a competent gas installer. Bord Gáis, as part of a

Standards exist (I.S. 813 or I.S. 820) to protect you from sub standard work,
which, in the case of gas equipment installation or repair, could be deadly. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.rgii.ie/">You can find a Registered Gas Installer

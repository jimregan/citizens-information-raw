<p>If you buy unfit or faulty goods you are entitled to a replacement, a repair
or a refund. Whether you are entitled to a replacement, repair or a refund can
depend on the goods in question and other circumstances. The Competition and
Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) provide <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/faulty-goods">examples of when you can expect
a replacement, repair or a refund on the CCPC website</a>.</p>

<p>If you are entitled to a refund it is worthwhile noting that the retailer or
supplier of services can give a refund in cash, cheque or to a credit card
account. If you are returning goods that are faulty you do not have to accept a
credit note or a voucher. The differences between refunds, credit notes and
vouchers are explained below.</p>
<ul><li>A <span>refund</span> means the retailer returns the money you paid for
    faulty goods. If you originally paid for the goods on a credit or debit
    card, the retailer may refund the credit or debit card instead of giving
    cash. If your consumer complaint is valid a retailer cannot insist on
    giving you a credit note instead of a refund. </li>
  <li>A <span>credit note</span> is a paper note issued by a retailer to a
    customer when goods are returned. A credit note acts like a voucher that
    can only be used in the particular shop or chain of shops that issued the
    credit note. If you are returning goods that are faulty you do not have to
    accept a credit note. Instead, you can ask for a repair, a replacement or a
    refund depending on the goods in question and other circumstances. If you
    accept a credit note you may not be able to ask for a refund afterwards.
  </li>
  <li>A <span>voucher</span> is a paper note or a card. Generally you can only
    use a voucher with a particular service provider or retailer. When you buy
    a voucher, the terms of the voucher should be stated (for example how long
    the voucher is valid for). You have no rights if you lose a voucher. </li>
</ul><p>Remember, if you change your mind about a product you are not entitled to
either return the goods or to a refund. In this case, a retailer may give you a
refund or a credit note to the value of the goods but they are not obliged to
do so.</p>
</div>
You should always ask for a receipt when you are buying goods or services. 

<p>Each consumer case is different and there are few hard and fast rules so
contact the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission or other <a shape="rect" href="../consumer_rights/consumer_protection_organisations.html">consumer
protection organisation</a> to find out exactly what your rights are. <br></p>

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>If you have a dispute with a company in Ireland or elsewhere in the EU you
should attempt to solve the dispute in the first instance directly with the
company. If this fails you may take your case to court - <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/small_claims_court.html">the Small Claims
Court</a> is particularly useful for claims worth under €2,000.
Alternatively, you could use mediation services provided by a third party.
These mediation services are alternative ways of resolving serious disputes
without going to court. The main benefit of using alternative dispute
resolution is that it is easy to use and cheaper than going to court. It is
particularly useful if you have a consumer complaint with a company based in
another EU country. Equally, these bodies can be used to resolve problems with
particular goods and services in your home country. Organisations that provide
alternative ways of resolving serious disputes are called alternative dispute
resolution (ADR) organisations.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.djei.ie/en/Legislation/Legislation-Files/Directive-2013-11-EU-on-alternative-dispute-resolution-for-consumer-disputes-and-amending-Regulation-EC-No-2006-2004-and-Directive-2009-22-EC.pdf">EU
Directive 2013/11/EU (pdf)</a> on alternative dispute resolution for consumer
disputes was transposed into Irish law by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2015/en.si.2015.0343.pdf">European
Union (Alternative Dispute Resolution for Consumer Disputes) Regulations 2015
(SI 343/2015) (pdf)</a>. Under the Regulations the Competition and Consumer
Protection Commission (CCPC) has been appointed as the competent authority to
oversee and regulate the functioning of alternative dispute resolution entities
established in Ireland. </p>

<h3>What is an alternative dispute resolution organisation?</h3>

<p>There is a whole range of organisations and agencies that can help you to
enforce your consumer rights in Ireland and within the EU. Some organisations
have a number of functions in addition to dealing with consumer complaints.
Essentially, there are four main types of alternative dispute resolution
organisation; </p>
<ul><li>Ombudsmen </li>
  <li>Regulators </li>
  <li>Trade associations or professional bodies </li>
  <li>Commissions and commissioners </li>
</ul><p><span>An Ombudsman</span> is an official appointed to investigate
individuals’ complaints about bad administration, especially that of public
authorities. In Ireland <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/office_of_the_ombudsman.html">Ombudsman</a>
investigates complaints made by members of the public who feel that they have
been unfairly treated by certain public bodies. The <a href="../../../birth_family_relationships/children_s_rights_and_policy/the_ombudsman_for_children.html">Ombudsman
for Children</a> investigates complaints made by children or on behalf of
children against certain public bodies, schools and hospitals. <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/european_government/eu_institutions/european_ombudsman.html">The
European Ombudsman</a> investigates complaints involving any of the EU
Institutions. No ombudsman exists for complaints about administrations in other
EU Member States but <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/european_government/eu_law/solvit.html">SOLVIT</a>
will attempt to solve any disputes you may have. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.financialombudsman.ie">The Financial Ombudsman Service</a>
will help you with complaints about financial institutions or insurance
companies and <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/ombudsman_for_pensions.html">pensions
companies have their own ombudsman</a>. Generally ombudsmen will take on your
case only if you are still dissatisfied with an organisation, having exhausted
their internal complaints mechanism. </p>

<p><span>Regulators are agencies established by law</span> to oversee specific
parts of industry to ensure that they comply with the law. In Ireland,
regulators look after areas of public utilities and financial services. For
example <a shape="rect" href="http://www.comreg.ie/">ComReg</a> regulates
telecommunications, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.cer.ie/">Commission
for Energy Regulation</a> regulates the gas and electricity suppliers and the
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.centralbank.ie/Pages/home.aspx">Central
Bank</a> regulates the financial services sector. Regulators aim to promote
competition while ensuring vulnerable consumers have sufficient services at
reasonable prices.</p>

<p><span>Trade associations or professional bodies</span> such as the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.lawsociety.ie">Law Society</a> or the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.reci.ie">Register of Electrical Contractors of
Ireland</a> exist to represent their industry. Some professional bodies and
trade associations, such as the <a shape="rect" href="../consumer_rights/advertising_standards_authority_for_ireland.html">Advertising
Standards Association for Ireland</a> have codes of practice that they enforce.
Not all trades and professions have a representative body. Even where there is
a representative body for a particular trade or profession, not all of them
have a code of practice to enforce. </p>

<p><span>Commissions and commissioners</span> exist to protect your rights.
These are generally statutory bodies and are set up to ensure your rights
according to particular laws. For example the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/data_protection.html">Data
Protection Commissioner</a> implements the Data Protection Acts and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oic.ie">Information Commissioner</a> is
responsible for overseeing <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/freedom_of_information.html">Ireland’s
Freedom of Information laws</a>. </p>

<p>Alternative dispute resolution organisations are flexible and deal with
disputes from both consumers and businesses. They are impartial and make all
information about the organisation readily available to consumers. They must
also ensure the effectiveness of their settlement procedure and encourage both
sides to co-operate, yet make them aware that it is within their rights to
withdraw at any time. </p>

<h3>Types of alternative dispute resolution </h3>

<p>There are two types of alternative dispute resolution, mediation and
arbitration. </p>

<p><span><strong>Mediation:</strong> </span>Both parties involved in the
dispute agree to use a neutral third party to help solve the dispute. The terms
of the agreement are decided between the parties with the help of the mediator
(or alternative dispute resolution body). Generally, decisions made in
mediation are not legally binding but they can be made so if both parties agree
to it.</p>

<p><span><strong>Arbitration:</strong> </span>Both parties involved in the
dispute agree to go to an arbitrator to resolve issues. The decision of the
arbitrator is legally binding and the process is governed by law (<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0001/index.html">Arbitration
Act 2010</a>). You can represent yourself but you may benefit from legal
representation if a dispute is taken to an arbitrator. </p>

<h3>How does alternative dispute resolution work?</h3>

<p>Whether you choose to avail of alternative methods of resolving your dispute
is a personal choice. You are not obliged to avail of these methods of redress
and have the right to take a claim to court if you so wish. Some consumer
contracts however will bind you to pursue your case through arbitration. An
example might include a <a shape="rect" href="../../travel/package_holidays.html">complaint regarding a package
holiday</a>. Arbitration bodies have the power to make legally binding
decisions. This means that the decision places a legal requirement on the
retailer or you to act in a certain way. (i.e., to repay the money, to fix the
item, to return the item, etc.). If the outcome of your alternative dispute
resolution is legally binding on either party, you may not then be able to take
the case to court. </p>

<h3>Access to alternative dispute resolution organisations in Europe</h3>

<p>The network of European Consumer Centres (ECC) helps to solve cross-border
consumer problems within the EU. Each ECC provides free and confidential
information to consumers and tries to assist them with their cross-border
disputes by attempting contact with traders based in other EU member states,
where appropriate. If the ECC’s intervention fails to resolve the complaint,
consumers may be referred to an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) entity in
Ireland or in another EU country, if available. <br></p>

<p>Use alternative dispute resolution after you have exhausted all informal
channels for solving the problem directly with the business or public service.

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>While the services of some alternative dispute resolution bodies are free,
the services of others are not. If you contact an alternative dispute
resolution body, clarify what the charges are before you begin an alternative
dispute resolution process. </p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>There is a range of organisations and agencies that can help you to enforce
your rights in specific circumstances. If you wish to apply for the services of
an alternative dispute resolution organisation in Ireland you must contact the
organisation directly. </p>

<p>If you live in Ireland and your complaint is against a retailer or service
provider in another EU Member State the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.eccdublin.ie">European Consumer Centre Ireland</a> will be
able to provide you with advice on enforcing your rights.</p>

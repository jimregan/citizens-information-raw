<p>The following are statutory regulatory bodies for the health and social care
professions in Ireland. In general, they promote high standards of professional
conduct, maintain a register of qualified personnel and investigate allegations
of professional misconduct or fitness to practice. They usually have a Fitness
to Practise or similar committee. This committee deals with complaints into the
conduct of a registered practitioner. The complaint may be on the grounds of
professional misconduct and/or fitness to engage in the practice by reason of
physical or mental disability.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0027/index.html">Health
and Social Care Professionals Act 2005</a> provided for a system of statutory
registration for certain health and social care professions. They are:</p>
<ul><li>Clinical biochemists </li>
  <li>Dieticians </li>
  <li>Medical scientists </li>
  <li>Occupational therapists</li>
  <li>Optometrists and dispensing opticians</li>
  <li>Orthoptists </li>
  <li>Physiotherapists </li>
  <li>Podiatrists </li>
  <li>Psychologists </li>
  <li>Radiographers </li>
  <li>Social care workers </li>
  <li>Social workers </li>
  <li>Speech and language therapists 
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ul><p>The <a href="http://www.coru.ie/">Health and Social Care Professionals
Council (CORU)</a> was established in March 2007. It is in the process of
establishing a Registration Board for each of these professions, as well as a
committee structure to deal with <a href="http://www.coru.ie/en/public">complaints made against registered
professionals</a>. You can <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/care_in_your_community/registration_of_health_and_social_care_professionals.html">read

<h3>Doctors</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.medicalcouncil.ie/contact/default.asp">The

Act 2007</a> as the pharmacy regulator. It is charged with regulating the
practice and profession of pharmacy. All pharmacies and pharmacists must be

health, and its primary responsibility is to the general public.</p>

<h3>Vets</h3>

<h3><strong>Alternative healthcare practitioners</strong></h3>

<p>Complementary and alternative healthcare practitioners are professionals who
use acupuncture, herbs, homeopathy, therapeutic massage, oriental medicine or
other methods to promote well being or treat health conditions. There are no
statutory registration requirements for the practitioners of complementary
therapies currently. </p>

<p>While they are not subject to statutory professional regulation, they are
subject to legislation, similar to other practitioners, including consumer
protection, health and safety, competition, contract and criminal law.<br></p>

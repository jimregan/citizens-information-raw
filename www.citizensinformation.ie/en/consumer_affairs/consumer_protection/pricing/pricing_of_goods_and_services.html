<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>Generally, there are no controls on prices in Ireland. This means that, with
a few exceptions, there is no legislation explicitly stating what the maximum
or the minimum price for any product or service should be. The main reason for
this is to promote competition amongst retailers and service providers. It is,
however, up to you to 'shop around' for the best value products. If you think
the prices of goods or services are too high, you can let the retailer know.
You should be aware that the retailer is <span>not committing any
offence</span> charging more than their competitors. If you feel you are being
overcharged you have the option of purchasing the item or service elsewhere.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2002/en/si/0639.html">S.I. No. 639 of 2002
European Communities (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations</a>
as well as the various price Display Orders (Catering Display, Petrol and
Diesel Display, Drinks Price Display, Hairdressing Display and the Tax
Inclusive Display Orders) exist to ensure that consumers have enough
information on prices to make comparisons between products and services. Under
the EC (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices Regulations) 2002, retailers
and service providers must show a price of a product and it must be in euro.
Unit prices for products sold by weight, volume or measure must also be shown
(for example, price per litre, kilo or metre or square metre). The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2007/0607/b06c07d.pdf">Consumer
Protection Act 2007</a> prohibits false or misleading indications of the price
or the recommended price of goods or services. Prices displayed must be
complete, and there should be no hidden charges included. Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1973/en/si/0009.html">Prices
and Charges (Tax- Inclusive Statements) Order 1973</a> all prices for goods and
services available to the consumer must be inclusive of all taxes including
Value Added Tax (VAT). Exceptions to this are when the goods are intended
solely for a business customer (such as machinery hire shops etc.). There are
also specific laws concerning the display of <a href="price_display_of_goods_and_services.html">prices in Bars, Restaurants,
Service Stations and Hairdressers</a>. </p>

<p>If a retailer makes a mistake and the actual price for the item is more than
that displayed the retailers have certain rights. They do not automatically
have to sell you the goods at the price stated. It is the retailer's
responsibility to correct the mistake as soon as possible. If the retailer
<span>knowingly</span> charges more for a product than is displayed an offence
may be committed. Generally, if you are told the correct price before you pay,
you have no right to redress. If you notice the error after you have paid, you
should bring the matter to the retailer's attention who, most likely, would
refund you the difference. You could also report the matter to the Competition
and Consumer Protection Commission. The office will investigate the complaint
with the objective of ensuring future compliance with the Act. This however
does not mean financial redress for the individual complainant. </p>

<p>Your rights are exactly the same when you buy items or services in a sale as
at any other time. If a reduction is displayed on an item, the previous price
must have been valid for 28 days over the previous three months. </p>

<h3>Regulation of prices</h3>

<p>Some prices (especially services / utilities) are regulated. This means that
the service provider or retailer must apply to the industry regulator for
approval for any price increase. The most notable examples include electricity,
telecommunications and postal services. In these cases, the suppliers of
electricity must apply to the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.cer.ie">Commission for Energy Regulation</a> and dominant
suppliers in the postal and telecom markets must apply to <a shape="rect" href="http://www.comreg.ie">ComReg</a> for approval for price changes.
Suppliers of these services may not charge more than the approved prices.
Suppliers of financial services do not have to apply for approval for price
changes. (For example, where there is a change to bank charges, or interest
rates). However financial service providers must inform their regulator, the <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/Pages/home.aspx">Central Bank of
Ireland</a> about any such changes.</p>

<h3>Unit pricing</h3>

<p>Unit pricing is a useful tool for comparing prices. It is most useful when
comparing food and grocery prices when products come in different size
packages. The price for a product tells you how much you pay for an item. The
unit price, however, tells you the price of a Kg, litre, metre, square metre or
cubic metre. Unit pricing helps you compare costs of different brands and
various sizes without doing complicated calculations. The law, (SI 639 of 2002)
sets down that unit <span>prices</span> <span>must be displayed on</span> or
<span>close to the item</span>. There are <span>exceptions</span> for traders
who do not have equipment for printing shelf-edge labels or for point-of-sale
scanning. The Regulations only apply to <span>products being sold to the
consumer</span>.</p>

<p>By using unit pricing, you can easily compare the cost of any brand and any
package size. Remember to compare only similar items. Unit pricing will not
help you compare nutritional value or other factors you wish to consider, such
as convenience and personal tastes </p>

<h3>Competition in the marketplace</h3>

<p>Competition law in Ireland exists to protect and benefit consumers.
Anti-competitive practices are business practices which prevent or reduce
competition in a market. Anti-competitive behaviour by businesses may result in
consumers paying higher prices. The Competition and Consumer Protection
Commission exists to ensure that anti-competitive behaviour does not occur. If
you find that all suppliers are charging the same price for an item or service
this may constitute anti-competitive behaviour and should be reported to the
Commission. Read more about <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ccpc.ie/">making a
complaint to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission here</a>.</p>

<p>Anti-competitive practices include:</p>
<ul><li>Price fixing, where companies collude to set prices. That is businesses
    selling the same item or service agree what prices should be charged for a
    particular product or service. </li>
  <li>Tying, where different products are linked together to prevent consumer
    choice. </li>
  <li>Resale price maintenance, where resellers are not allowed to set prices
    independently. </li>
</ul><p>It is usually difficult for a business to use anti-competitive practices
unless the parties involved have significant market power. </p>

<p>If you have a complaint regarding the pricing of any good or service, you
should begin by taking this up with the retailer. There may be a simple

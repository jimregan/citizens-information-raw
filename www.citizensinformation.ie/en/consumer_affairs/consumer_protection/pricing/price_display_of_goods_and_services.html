<p>In Ireland while there are no controls on prices, there is legislation the
way prices of products and services are displayed to consumers. These laws
consist of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2002/en/si/0639.html">EC (Requirements to
Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002</a> and Orders made under the Prices
Act 1958 to 1972 and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2007/0607/b06c07d.pdf">Consumer
Protection Act 2007 (pdf)</a>. The legislation ensures that consumers have
enough information to make price comparisons between different products and
services.</p>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2010/si/533/made/en/print">European
Union (Provision of Services) Regulations 2010</a> certain service providers
should provide the price of a service or a detailed estimate of a price for a
service at the request of the recipient. The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2013/si/484/made/en/print">European
Union (Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulation 2013</a>
provides protection to consumers from excessive and stealth charges separate
from and additional to the price paid for goods or services under a consumer
contract. <br></p>

<h3>Retail outlets</h3>

<p>The purpose of the EC (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations
2002 is to enable consumer to see the price of the product before buying and to
make price comparisons. The price of products on sale in shops and supermarkets
may be attached to the items themselves. Alternatively they may be displayed on
a label on the edge of the shelf. Generally, shelf labels are used to display
prices in supermarkets since barcodes have becomes more popular. Under the EC
(Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002, retailers must show
the correct selling price in euro including taxes. Unit prices for products
sold by weight volume or measure must also be clearly displayed. <a shape="rect" href="pricing_of_goods_and_services.html">More detailed
information on pricing of goods and services is available here</a>. The
Regulations provide for certain exemptions from unit pricing such as items
which are equal or less than 50 ml or 50 grams. The Regulations also extend to
online shopping. Services are not covered by the Product Pricing
Regulations.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1973/en/si/0009.html">Prices and Charges
(Tax-Inclusive Statements) Order, 1973</a> requires that all prices marked on
goods or prices displayed or quoted at the retail level and all charges for
services displayed or quoted should be tax-inclusive (e.g. VAT) except where it
is intended solely for a business customer.</p>

<h3>Licensed premises </h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1999/en/si/0263.html">The Retail Price
(Beverages in Licensed Premises) Display Order, 1999</a> is designed to inform
customers about the prices charged in licensed premises. Licensed premises in
Ireland includes bars, night-clubs, or other venues that require a vintners
license to operate. The order states that licensed premises display 2 lists of
drinks prices. A comprehensive list of all items sold and a summary (i.e.,
abbreviated) list of the 16 most popular drinks for sale. If there are
different prices in different areas of the licensed premises (for example
prices for drinks are different in the Lounge and in the Bar) these notices
need to be displayed prominently in all areas where the products are sold. If
the prices change after a certain time (for example after 11p.m.) this also
needs to be displayed on the notice. Price lists should cover drinks sold for
consumption on the premises. Off-licences are not covered by this Order but
they are covered by the Requirements to Indicate Product Prices Regulations
2002.</p>

<p>A 16 item list of prices needs to be displayed prominently either inside or
directly outside the entrance of the premises. The following is a list of 16
items that need to be displayed by publicans to comply with the order:</p>
<ul><li>Pint (568 ml) of draught stout </li>
  <li>Pint (568ml) of draught ale </li>
  <li>Pint (568 ml) of draught lager </li>
  <li>Pint (568ml) of draught cider </li>
  <li>Bottle (330ml) of stout </li>
  <li>Bottle (330ml) of ale </li>
  <li>Bottle (330ml) of lager </li>
  <li>Bottle (330ml) of cider </li>
  <li>Measure (35.5ml) of whiskey </li>
  <li>Measure (35.5ml) of gin </li>
  <li>Measure (35.5ml) of vodka </li>
  <li>Bottle (200ml) of carbonated drink </li>
  <li>Bottle (200ml) of carbonated cola drink </li>
  <li>Bottle (113ml) of a mixer </li>
  <li>Bottle (250ml) of water </li>
  <li>A bottle (187ml) of wine </li>
</ul><p>Both the 16 item and the comprehensive list need to be <span>clear</span>
and <span>visible to customers</span>. That means the <span>price lists must be
displayed in a prominent position</span> where <span>anyone could reasonably
see them</span>. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission surveys
licensed premises to ensure their compliance with the law. It can prosecute
publicans and licensees who are found to be in breach of the Order.</p>

<h3>Food in restaurants, cafés and hotels</h3>

<p>If you visit a restaurant you can reasonably expect to be informed about
their prices for food. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1984/en/si/0213.html">The Retail Prices
(Food in Catering Establishments) Display Order, 1984</a> requires the owners
to display a comprehensive price list of food items. This law applies to all
hotels, pubs, restaurants, cafés, etc. that offer food for sale and
consumption on the premises. This notice should be visible immediately outside
or inside where the food is being served. In the case of a hotel or a licensed
premises where food is served in some areas, the notice can be displayed either
at the entrance to the premises or at the entrance to the catering area. Any
extra charges that apply (such as service charges etc) must be stated clearly
on the notice too.</p>

<h3>Hairdressers</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1976/en/si/0156.html">The Charges
(Hairdressing) Display Order, 1976</a> requires hairdressers to display a
notice setting out the charges for every service rendered by them as a
hairdresser. (In this context, the term ‘hairdressers’ also includes
barbershops). If possible the notice must be visible from the street or
immediately inside the entrance to the hairdressers. The notice must also be
clearly visible and easy to read. </p>

<h3>Diesel and petrol</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/si/0178.html">The Retail Prices
(Diesel and Petrol) Display Order, 1997</a> requires that service stations
display the prices for petrol and diesel. The notice must be clearly visible
from the side of the road and be in writing <span>at least 20cm in
height</span>. The Order specifies that the prices must be displayed in litres.
In addition, the <span>actual price charged at the petrol pump</span> must
<span>match the price displayed</span>. </p>

<h3>Concert and theatre tickets</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/si/0103.html">The Consumer
Information (Advertisements for Concert or Theatre Performances) Order,
1997</a> sets down that every written advertisement for a public concert or
theatre performance must indicate the admission price. Any additional charge
and the circumstances in which such additional charges are payable must be
stated separately, in either monetary or percentage terms (for example, if
there is an extra charge for paying by credit card this must be stated in the
written advertisement). In all other forms of advertising (e.g. radio or TV
advertising) the admission price must be stated together with a reference to
the fact that an additional charge may be payable in certain circumstances.</p>

<h3>Airfares</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/si/0468.html">The Consumer
Information (Advertisements for Airfares) Order, 2000</a> specifies rules for
the advertisements of airfares. In every advertisement for airfares (including
radio, television and print) the total price must be clearly stated.
Specifically this means the price payable for the airfare must include all
charges (i.e., taxes, etc.). If restrictions apply, then every restriction
should be clearly specified in the advertisement. (For example, the airfare
price may only be applicable to flights between certain dates, times, etc).</p>

<h3>Dental practices</h3>

<p>Under a <a href="http://dentalcouncil.ie/files/Display%20of%20Private%20Fees%20-%20Code%20of%20Practice%20(Feb%202011)%20-%2020110330.pdf">Code
of Practice (pdf)</a> issued by the <a href="http://www.dentalcouncil.ie/">Dental Council</a>, dentists must display
private fees in a place where patients can view them before consultation. For
certain specified procedures a single fee should apply. The fee for certain
other procedures should be shown as a range, with both a minimum and a maximum
fee clearly stated. For all other treatments, dentists should provide an
estimate of the cost of that treatment and obtain the patient's agreement and
consent before treatment starts.</p>

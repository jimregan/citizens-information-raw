<p>The <span class="link-external"><a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:149:0022:0039:EN:PDF">EU
Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (Directive 2005/28/EC of 11 May 2005)
(pdf)</a></span> deals with unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices
(it does not apply to dealings between businesses). The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2007/a1907.pdf">Consumer
Protection Act 2007</a> which was brought into effect in May 2007 provides for
its implementation in Ireland. All parts of the Act have been implemented
(apart from Sections 48 and 49 which deal with surcharges on certain payment
methods â€“ see below).</p>

<p>The Act provides that a range of unfair, misleading and aggressive trading
practices are banned if they are likely to cause appreciable impairment of your
ability to make an informed choice in relation to the product concerned and
cause you to make a decision about a transaction you would not otherwise make.
These practices are banned if they meet two conditions: </p>
<ol><li>They are unfair, misleading or aggressive </li>
  <li>They are likely to distort your consumer choice </li>
</ol><p>The legislation also provides that certain practices are always banned -
these do not have to meet the second condition.</p>

<p>Information on unfair commercial practices is available under an EU
initiative at <a shape="rect" href="http://www.isitfair.eu/">http://www.isitfair.eu/</a></p>

<p>The agency given responsibility for enforcing the provisions of the
legislation is the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission. The Central
Bank of Ireland also has a role in enforcing the provisions in the financial
services area. There is <a shape="rect" href="consumer_protection_act_2007.html">more information on enforcement
here</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l28a33">Unfair practices </h2>

<p>A commercial practice is considered to be unfair if it is contrary to the
requirements of professional diligence. That means it is contrary to the
general principle of good faith in the trader's field of activity and/or the
standard of skill and care that the trader could reasonably be expected to
exercise towards consumers.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l11f58">Misleading practices </h2>

<p>Existing consumer legislation already prohibited some misleading commercial
practices, for example, misleading advertisements. This Act, however, provides
for a more extensive list of prohibited practices. The sale of property was not
covered by existing legislation but <strong>is included</strong> in the scope
of this Act. The Minister has the power to make Regulations prescribing the
sort of information which must be provided with specific products and with
specific advertising.</p>

<p>The Act provides that certain practices in relation to</p>
<ul><li>Products </li>
  <li>Marketing and advertising </li>
  <li>Codes of practice </li>
  <li>Omission of information </li>
  <li>Unclear information </li>
  <li>Payments </li>
</ul><p>are misleading. More detailed information on these specific practices is set
out below: </p>

<p><strong>Products</strong> </p>

<p>A commercial practice is misleading if it includes providing false
information about or, would cause you to be deceived about:</p>
<ul><li>The existence or nature of a product and its main characteristics </li>
  <li>The price </li>
  <li>The need for any part, replacement, servicing or repair </li>
  <li>The existence, extent or nature of any approval or sponsorship (direct or
    indirect) of the product by others </li>
  <li>The nature, attributes or rights of the trader </li>
  <li>The extent of the trader's commitments </li>
  <li>The trader's motives for the commercial practice </li>
  <li>The nature of the trader's supply process </li>
  <li>The legal rights of a consumer </li>
</ul><p>The Act gives the Minister the power to make Regulations that require some
products to carry specified information.</p>

<p><strong>Marketing and advertising</strong></p>

<p>A commercial practice involving marketing or advertising is misleading if it
causes the average person to confuse a competitor's product with the trader's
product or a competitor's trade name or trademark, or some other distinguishing
feature or mark, with that of the trader. </p>

<p><strong>Codes of practice</strong> </p>

<p>A commercial practice is misleading if it involves a representation that the
trader abides or is bound by a code of practice and the trader fails to comply
with a firm commitment in that code of practice. </p>

<p><strong>Omission of information</strong> </p>

<p>A commercial practices is misleading if the trader omits or conceals
material information that the average consumer would need in order to make an
informed decision. </p>

<p><strong>Unclear information</strong> </p>

<p>A commercial practice is misleading if the trader provides material
information in a manner that is unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely,
or fails to identify the commercial intent of the practice. </p>

<p><strong>Payment methods</strong> </p>

<p>The Act outlaws the practice of charging consumers more for using different
methods of payment. Traders who are prepared to accept payment by two or more
of the following: </p>
<ul><li>Cash </li>
  <li>Credit card </li>
  <li>Direct debit </li>
  <li>Any other prescribed method </li>
</ul><p><strong>may not charge the consumer more</strong> for using one such method.
</p>

<p>So, for example, if it is possible to pay for goods in cash or by credit
card, you <strong>cannot be charged more</strong> for paying by credit card. It
will continue to be legal to impose a charge for payment by credit card if
there is <strong>no alternative method of payment</strong> or if the charge
applies to all methods of payment, but the price quoted <strong>must
include</strong> such a charge. </p>

<p>The sections on payment methods were not implemented in May 2007 with the
rest of the Act. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l74342">Aggressive practices </h2>

<p>Aggressive commercial practices are defined as practices involving
harassment, coercion or undue influence that impair your freedom of choice and
affect your purchasing decisions. The Act sets out some examples of aggressive
practices (but the list is not exhaustive). Aggressive commercial practices
include:</p>
<ul><li>Sales tactics that try to intimidate or coerce consumers . </li>
  <li>The use of threatening or abusive behaviour . </li>
  <li>Practices that try to take advantage of vulnerable consumers. (A
    vulnerable consumer is one whom the trader could foresee as vulnerable
    because of mental or physical infirmity, age or credulity.) </li>
  <li>The imposition of onerous or disproportionate non-contractual barriers by
    the trader when the consumer wishes to end the contract or exercise a
    contractual right, or switch to another product or trader. </li>
  <li>Threats to take legal action when the trader has no basis for such
    action. </li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="ld8ace">Practices which are always banned
</h2>

<p>The Act provides that certain commercial practices are always banned,
whether or not they would affect a consumer's decision. They include:</p>
<ul><li>Claims that a product or trader has an endorsement or authorisation that
    does not exist or that the product or trader is not in compliance with </li>
  <li>False claims that a trader is about to cease trading or move premises
  </li>
  <li>Prize promotions where there is either no prize or consumers must make a
    payment in order to claim a prize </li>
  <li>False claims that the supply of a product is legal </li>
  <li>False claims that products can cure illnesses </li>
  <li>Persistent unwanted cold calling </li>
  <li>Creating an impression that a consumer cannot leave the premises until a
    contract is formed </li>
  <li>Requiring a consumer to produce documents which are irrelevant in the
    case of an insurance claim or persistently failing to answer a consumer's
    correspondence in respect of an insurance claim in order to dissuade
    consumers from exercising their rights under the contract </li>
  <li>Advertisements directly aimed at getting children to buy products or
    persuade adults to buy for them </li>
</ul></div>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/act/pub/0019/index.html">Consumer
Protection Act 2007</a> came into effect in Ireland on 1 May 2007. The Act
provided for the establishment of the National Consumer Agency. Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0029/index.html">Competition
and Consumer Protection Act 2014</a> the National Consumer Agency and the
Competition Authority were replaced by the <a href="http://www.ccpc.ie/">Competition and Consumer Protection Commission</a>.
The Commission took over the functions of the two agencies. </p>

<p>The 2007 Act also put the EU Directive on unfair commercial practices into
national law and it made various changes to our consumer laws. It also repealed
certain older consumer laws, some of which dated from the 19th century.</p>

<p>The Consumer Protection Act 2007 is quite complex and includes some detailed
definitions. The following is a summary of its main provisions:</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lfb439">Competition and Consumer Protection
Commission</h2>

<p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) was established on
31 October 2014 and took over the functions and powers of the National Consumer
Agency. It has a general function of promoting consumer welfare and is
responsible for investigating, enforcing and encouraging compliance with
consumer law. It has a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/">website for consumers</a>. </p>

<p>There is more information on <a href="http://www.ccpc.ie/about/what-we-do">what the Commission does</a> on its
website.</p>

<h3>Unfair commercial practices</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:149:0022:0039:EN:PDF">EU
Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (Directive 2005/28/EC of 11 May 2005)
(pdf)</a> deals with unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices, (it does
not apply to dealings between businesses). The Consumer Protection Act 2007
provides for its implementation in Ireland.</p>

<p>The Act provides that a range of unfair, misleading and aggressive trading
practices are banned if they would be likely to cause appreciable impairment of
the average consumer's ability to make an informed choice in relation to the
product concerned and would cause the average consumer to make a decision about
a transaction that they would not otherwise make. Practices are banned,
therefore, if they meet two conditions: </p>
<ol><li>They are unfair, misleading or aggressive </li>
  <li>They are likely to distort your consumer's choice </li>
</ol><p>The Act also provides that certain practices are always banned - these do
not have to meet the second condition. There is <a shape="rect" href="unfair_commercial_practices.html">more information on unfair commercial
practices here</a>.</p>

<h3>Price display regulations </h3>

<p>The Consumer Protection Act 2007 gives the Minister the power to make
Regulations requiring that the prices of certain products be displayed in a
specific manner. For example, they could provide that prices of certain
products must be displayed inclusive of charges, fees and taxes.</p>

<h3>Price controls</h3>

<p>The Prices Acts 1958-1972 gave the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and
Innovation a range of powers to set maximum prices. The Act repeals all of
these powers except the power to control prices in emergency situations. It
provides that the power to control prices in emergency situations must be
exercised by the government and not the Minister. </p>

<h3>Pyramid selling </h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1980/en/act/pub/0027/index.html">Pyramid
Selling Act 1980</a> was repealed by the Consumer Protection Act 2007 and
replaced by new provisions. These provisions ban participation in pyramid
schemes and inducing others to participate. They also ban the establishment,
operation or promotion of these schemes and increase the penalties for breaking
the law. The new penalties for offences relating to pyramid schemes involve a
fine of up to €150,000 and a prison term of up to five years. </p>

<h3>Codes of practice </h3>

<p>The Consumer Protection Act 2007 provides for the recognition of codes of
practice drawn up by traders or groups of traders and for the CCPC to approve
such codes. It also provides that the CCPC may issue guidelines to traders
about consumer protection and welfare, commercial practices, quality assurance
schemes and codes of practice. </p>

<h3>Casual trading licences </h3>

<p>The Act gives power to the Minister to introduce statutory guidelines for
local authorities in regard to the issuing of casual trading licences.
Non-statutory guidelines were issued to local authorities in July 2005 and
again in July 2006 with a view to their being implemented on a voluntary basis.
If this does not prove satisfactory, the Minister can introduce statutory
guidelines. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l61438">Enforcement</h2>

<p>The Consumer Protection Act 2007 provides for enforcement mechanisms to be
available to the CCPC. </p>

<p>If the CCPC considers that there is a case for looking for an injunction or
a prohibition order against a trader, it may (as a first step) accept a written
undertaking from the trader containing whatever terms and conditions the CCPC
thinks are appropriate. If the trader fails to comply with the undertaking,
then the CCPC may look for a prohibition order.</p>

<p>The CCPC may serve a compliance notice on a trader whom it considers to have
engaged in a prohibited activity. The trader has 14 days in which to appeal the
notice. If the trader fails to comply, the CCPC may take criminal proceedings.
</p>

<p>The CCPC has the power to impose on-the-spot penalties for offences relating
to the display of prices. </p>

<p>It is also required to keep a Consumer Protection List and to publish this
list at any time and in any form it considers appropriate. This is a list of
traders convicted of criminal offences, subject to court orders, bound by an
undertaking, served with a compliance notice, or subject to a fixed payment
notice. </p>

<p>The CCPC may apply to the courts for an order requiring a trader who has
been convicted of a number of specified offences to publish, at his or her
expense, a corrective statement in respect of the facts relating to the
offence. </p>

<h3>Role of the Central Bank </h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/">Central Bank of Ireland</a> has a
role in enforcing the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 in the
financial services area. The CCPC and the Central Bank are required to have a
co-operation agreement setting out their respective roles.</p>

<h3>Whistleblowers <br></h3>

<p>The Act provides protection for people who report breaches of the
legislation to the CCPC.</p>

<h3>Redress for individual consumers </h3>

<p>Anyone, including the CCPC, may apply to the Circuit Court or the High Court
for an order prohibiting any practice (with some small exceptions) which is
unlawful under the Consumer Protection Act 2007. If an individual takes such an
action, notice must be given to the trader and to the CCPC. It is not necessary
to show loss or damage as a result of the trader's actions.</p>

<p>If a trader is convicted of an offence under the Act, it is open to the
court to require the trader to pay damages to a consumer who has suffered loss
as a result of the trader's actions. Such a compensation order may be instead
of, or in addition to, any fine or penalty the court imposes on the trader. </p>

<p>Consumers who are aggrieved by a prohibited act or practice may sue the
trader for damages. </p>

<h3>Penalties</h3>

<p>The Act provides for a range of penalties for the various offences. The
maximum fine for a first offence is €3,000 for summary convictions and
€60,000 for convictions on indictment. There are higher fines for repeat
offenders. </p>

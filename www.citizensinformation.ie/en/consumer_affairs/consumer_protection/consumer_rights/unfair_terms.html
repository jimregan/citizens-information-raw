<p>Consumers have legislative protection from unfair terms in consumer
contracts. An unfair term in a standard consumer contract is a term that is
significantly weighted against the consumer. In other words, the contract
contains a statement that puts the consumer at a disadvantage. A supplier of
goods or services can have an advantage over the consumer by including such an
unfair term in a contract. </p>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/si/0027.html">The
European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations, (SI
27/1995)</a> however, consumer contracts are open to a test of fairness. Any
term found by a Court to be unfair, is ineffective. SI 27/1995 was amended by
<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/si/0307.html">SI 307/2000</a>
and <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/si/0160.html">SI
160/2013</a>.</p>

<p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has supervisory powers to
ensure compliance with the legislation. In certain circumstances, the CCPC may
seek a court order preventing the use of contract terms that are considered to
be unfair. The CCPC publishes a detailed <a href="http://www.ccpc.ie/guide-unfair-terms-contracts">guide to unfair terms
and conditions in consumer contracts</a>.</p>

<h3>What are terms in a consumer contract? </h3>

<p>A contract is an agreement between 2 or more people that is enforceable by
law. When you buy goods or services you enter into a contract with the supplier
of goods and services. This is called a consumer contract. Specifically a
consumer is a person who is buying a service or a product from someone whose
normal business it is to sell that product or service. </p>

<p>Contracts may be written or oral. It is easier to know precisely what the
terms are in a written contract but an oral contract is also enforceable in
law. Consumer contracts may differ and there are no hard and fast rules
governing what terms should be in a consumer contract. </p>

<p>Contracts are made up of terms and there are different types of terms in
consumer contracts. Implied terms are not mentioned in a written or oral
consumer contract but exist all the same. An example of an implied term might
be that the product or service will last for a reasonable length of time taking
the cost of the item or service into account. Mandatory terms are terms that by
law have to be included in contracts – these are not common in consumer
contracts. Core terms are terms that set out the main conditions of a contract.
In a consumer contract, these core terms might include the price of the product
or service. Neither core terms nor mandatory terms are covered by the EU Unfair
Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulation 1995. </p>

<p>These regulations take into account the circumstances surrounding the
conclusion of the contract: for example, whether the product or service was
sold to the consumer in a fair and equitable manner.</p>

<p>The regulations do not however, apply to any term that has been individually
negotiated in a contract between a consumer and a supplier of goods and
services. They also do not cover contracts between individuals selling products
or services outside the course of their normal business or between one trader
and another. Other contracts relating to employment, succession rights, family
law or the formation of companies or partnerships are not covered by the
regulations.</p>

<h3>What is meant by an unfair term?</h3>

<p>As explained above, an unfair term in a consumer contract is a term that can
cause a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations to the
detriment of the consumer. There are 3 main categories that unfair terms may
fall into: </p>
<ul><li>Terms that give the supplier of goods or services the right to change the
    terms of the contract. </li>
  <li>Terms that limit the liability of the supplier of goods and services: for
    example no liability for death or personal injury arising out of an act or
    an omission by the supplier of goods or services. </li>
  <li>Terms that put an unfair burden on the consumer: for example a contract
    with a term stating that a deposit will be kept by the supplier of goods or
    services if the consumer cancels the contract but does not include a term
    saying that the supplier of goods or services will pay compensation if it
    does not fulfil its commitments. </li>
</ul><p>This list is not exhaustive. Terms that fit into one of the above categories
may be fair, and equally, a term may be deemed to be unfair which does not fit
into one of the above categories.</p>

<p>Unfair terms violate the principle of good faith. If you enter a contract in
good faith it means that your intentions are honest. The principle of good
faith could be violated by, for example, inserting a term in the small print of
the contract agreement where the consumer cannot see it easily. </p>

<p>In the case of written contracts, all terms must be written in plain,
understandable language. If there is a doubt about the meaning of a term, the
meaning that is most favourable to the consumer will prevail. If a term in the
contract is found to be unfair, the remainder of the contract may still be
legally binding on the consumer and the supplier of goods or services. This
means that while one term or condition of the contract may be illegal, the
remainder of the contract remains in force. </p>

<p>Complaints about unfair terms in consumer contracts should be made to the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.consumerconnect.ie/eng/">Competition and Consumer
Protection Commission (CCPC)</a>.</p>

<p>Normally an unfair term in a consumer contract will only come to light if a
problem arises between a consumer and a supplier of goods and services. If you
feel that a term in a contract is unfair you should bring it to the attention
of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC).<br></p>

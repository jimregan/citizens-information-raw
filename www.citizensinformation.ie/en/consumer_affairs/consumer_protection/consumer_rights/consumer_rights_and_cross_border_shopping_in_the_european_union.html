<p>The existence of a single European market gives access to a wider range of
products and services at competitive prices. Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/consumers/protection_of_consumers/l32022_en.htm">European
Directive on certain aspects of the sale of consumer goods and associated
guarantees (1999/44/EC)</a>, which was passed into law in January 2003 (<a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/si/0011.html">S.I. 11
of 2003</a>) in Ireland, all consumers purchasing goods in <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/european_government/european_union.html">any EU
Member State</a> are entitled to a basic set of consumer rights. The existence
of a single European market gives access to a wider range of products and
services at competitive prices.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="consumers_and_the_law_in_ireland.html">National
consumer laws</a> in a particular country may provide you with additional
rights as a consumer. That is, rights that supplement your rights provided by
EU laws. <span>Your basic right as a consumer is to have a product replaced,
repaired or to have a refund or reduction in price for any fault in the product
that you were not made aware of at the time of purchase.</span> There are
however a set of rules governing these rights. These rules are concerned mainly
with descriptions and statements made about the product, instructions and
guarantees.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The main rights that are given to every European consumer under the European
Directive on certain aspects of the sale of consumer goods and associated
guarantees (1999/44/EC) are set out below. </p>
<ul><li>If you purchase goods or services from another EU member state and they
    were advertised in your country, you are protected under consumer law of
    your home country. </li>
  <li>If you purchased goods or services from a representative of the business
    in your home country, national consumer law of your home country protects
    you. </li>
  <li>If you buy goods or services while you were visiting another EU member
    state the laws of the country in which you bought the items apply. </li>
</ul><p>Any statement made about consumer goods must be true or the retailer is
liable. This includes descriptions made in advertising, marketing, labelling or
statements made verbally or in writing by the retailer. If you are shown a
sample item, the item you buy must be of exactly the same quality. The product
must also be fit for its intended purpose (e.g., if you buy a can opener, it
must function as a can opener).</p>

<p>If the installation of a good is included in the purchase price, then the
retailer is liable for any mistakes made in the installation. If you are
installing a good yourself, any fault in the instructions is the responsibility
of the retailer. For example, if you bought a bed that you have to assemble
yourself and the instructions are in Chinese, the retailer must provide
instructions in English unless he or she made you aware of this at the time of
purchase and offered you a discount in price. </p>

<h3>Guarantees</h3>

<p>A guarantee is an enforceable warranty on the continuing usefulness of a
product. You may request a guarantee for the item, at the time of purchase.
This guarantee should include the duration of the guarantee, its territorial
scope and the name and address of the guarantor. The guarantee should be
available in <a shape="rect" href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/translation/translating/officiallanguages/index_en.htm">the
official languages of the EU</a>. The guarantee cannot undermine the rights
provided to you in European Directive on certain aspects of the sale of
consumer goods and associated guarantees or in national legislation. </p>

<h3>Tax</h3>

<p>Common tax rules apply when buying goods and services for your personal use
across the EU. Effectively this means the same tax rules apply to your item as
those that apply to nationals of the member state where you buy the goods or
services. You can bring your purchases home without having to pay additional
Value Added Tax (VAT) or excise duties. Exceptions to this rule apply to
purchases of motor vehicles and business purchases. <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/coming_to_live_in_ireland/importing_car_into_ireland.html">Read
more about importing a vehicle and Vehicle Registration Tax here</a>. </p>

<p>Purchases from other EU member states can only be inspected at national
borders on grounds of public order. Member states have the right to levy excise
duties on tobacco products and alcoholic beverages if these products are not
intended for personal use. <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/travel_to_ireland/customs_regulations_for_travellers.html">Read
more about customs regulations for travellers to Ireland here</a>. </p>

<p>If you are carrying larger quantities of alcohol or tobacco products you may
need to prove they are intended for personal use. In the case of online
purchases or postal purchases (i.e., <a shape="rect" href="distance_selling.html">distance sales</a> ),VAT is included in the price
of the item and the items should be sent directly to you. If you arrange to
ship the item yourself from another EU member state you need to contact the
Customs Section of the Revenue Commissioners. They can inform you about the
relevant levels of VAT that are payable. </p>

<h3>Distance selling</h3>

<p>If you purchase away from business premises for example, buying goods online
you are protected by the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011L0083&amp;rid=1">European
Directive (2011/83/EU) (pdf)</a>. You can find out more about your consumer
rights when <a href="distance_selling.html">shopping online</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>When making a complaint about a product, you should firstly contact the
retailer and inform them about your complaint. If you do not obtain a suitable
remedy from the retailer within a suitable time period, you can take further
action. </p>

<p>If your complaint is against a retailer in Ireland, you should complain to
the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC). </p>

<p>If you have a complaint arising from a purchase in another member state of
the EU apart from your home country it can be difficult to resolve issues that
you may have with the seller of the goods or services. Distance, language
differences and costs of court cases can prevent you from making consumer
complaints. However, supports are available for you if you have a cross border
dispute. ECC Ireland will intervene on your behalf with the trader in the other
member state in order to find a satisfactory solution. If this is not
successful, ECC Ireland will forward your case to its Clearing House section so
that the case can be sent to an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
organisation in the other country. </p>

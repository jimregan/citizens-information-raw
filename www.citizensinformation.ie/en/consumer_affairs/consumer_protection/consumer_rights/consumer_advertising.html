<p>An advertisement is a message that promotes a product or a service or gives
information to the public. Advertisements may take many forms; such as press
advertisements in newspapers or magazines, television and radio advertisements
or signs in shops. Advertisements can also be transmitted directly to you by
mail, fax, e-mail or text message. Advertisements are mostly made to encourage
consumers to buy particular products or services. There are rules regarding
advertisements in Ireland. The following information explains what your rights
are with regard to advertisements.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The main legislation concerning advertisements in Ireland is the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2007/0607/b06c07d.pdf">Consumer
Protection Act, 2007</a>. This Act sets out, among other things, various rules
that apply to claims made about goods and services. In particular this Act
protects consumers from misleading advertisements and ensures that trade is
fair. Under the Act it is an offence for an advertiser/trader to make false
claims about goods, services or prices. All types of communications that
promote goods or services are covered by the Act. This includes advertisements,
a notice in a shop or even a claim made by a sales assistant about a product or
service. EU laws also ensure that misleading advertising is forbidden in all
Member States. Under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1988/en/si/0134.html">SI 134/1988
(European Communities (Misleading Advertising) Regulations, 1988)</a>, any
person can apply to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/high_court.html">High Court</a> for an order
prohibiting the publication of misleading advertising. </p>

<p>Additional rules apply to the advertisement of financial services. The <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/financial_institutions/central_bank_and_financial_services_authority_of_ireland.html">Central
Bank of Ireland</a> is responsible for these rules. You can read more about <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/loans_and_credit/credit_advertising.html">credit

<h3>What is 'Misleading Advertising'? </h3>

<p>Misleading advertising means advertising that deceives or is likely to
deceive anyone that sees it. Misleading advertising may affect consumers’
choices regarding what they buy. It’s worth bearing in mind, that it may be
an offence for a trader to advertise good or services if it is likely to
mislead and therefore cause loss, damage or injury to the public. The following
are examples of how advertisements can be misleading: </p>
<ul><li>Claims made about the <span>characteristics</span> of goods and services
    contain a false statement of fact. (Example: A product weighs 900g instead
    of 1 Kg) </li>
  <li>The <span>price</span> or manner in which the price is calculated, is
    misrepresented. (Example: Goods are not offered at sale prices, but
    advertised as such) </li>
  <li>The <span>conditions of supply</span> of the goods or service differs to
    that advertised. (Example: 'free delivery' actually involves a fee or
    charge) </li>
  <li>The <span>attributes of the advertiser</span>, (the advertiser's
    identity, assets etc.) were untrue. (Example: 'an Irish based company'
    turns out to be based abroad) </li>
</ul><p>Advertisements can be deceptive in other ways. For example, if they conceal
or leave out important facts. (Example: '50% off everything' - really only
applies to certain items). Advertisements are also considered misleading if
they create a false impression even if everything stated in the advertisement
may be literally true. </p>

<h3>Code of Advertising Standards</h3>

<p>The Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland is an independent
self-regulatory body of the advertising industry. They govern the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.asai.ie/code/">Code of Standards for Advertising,
Promotional and Direct Marketing</a>. These codes of practice state that all
advertisements must be legal, decent, honest and truthful. <a shape="rect" href="advertising_standards_authority_for_ireland.html">Find out more about the
Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland (ASAI)</a>.</p>

<h3>eCommerce</h3>

<p>There are restrictions in Ireland on unsolicited direct marketing by
telephone, fax, automated calling systems, email, Short Messaging Service and
Multi Media Service. <span>'Spam'</span> (originating in the EU) sent to
subscribers is also illegal. <a shape="rect" href="../../telecommunications_and_postal_services/dealing_with_unsolicited_or_offensive_email.html">Read
more information about unsolicited commercial emails</a>.</p>

<p>The requirements of the Consumer Protection Act and the EC Product Prices
Regulations 2002 apply to online advertising. There is also some protection for
consumers from misleading advertisements received by email. The law also gives
individual member states the right in certain circumstances to act against
online businesses to protect consumers, particularly potential investors.When
you enter into a distance contract with a trader you have the right to expect
the same consumer protection as you would have if you bought the goods in a
local shop. The goods should be of merchantable quality, fit for the purpose
intended and as described. Because you are entering into a distance contract
you have additional protection under EU law. <a shape="rect" href="distance_selling.html">You can read more about buying online</a>.</p>

<p><span>Premium Rate Telecommunications Services</span> are regulated by
ComReg by way of a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.comreg.ie/_fileupload/publications/ComReg1054.pdf">Code of
Practice</a>. Callers who use premium rate telecommunication services are
charged for a range of services (weather forecasting, traffic, sport) that are
provided over the telephone. The code of practice requires that all services
and promotional material must comply with the law (including legislation
covering misleading advertising). Advertisements for these services must not
contain or promote anything, which is in breach of the law, nor omit anything
which the law requires. All promotions must not seek to take advantage of lack
of consumer knowledge by using technical jargon or other methods. </p>

<h3>Rights of redress </h3>

<p>If you find an advertisement that you consider to be misleading you should
contact the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC). Under the
Consumer Protection Act, the CCPC is empowered to take action against
businesses which mislead the consumer. Where you have bought badly as a result
of misleading advertising the CCPC cannot get compensation for you. You may
have a case against the advertiser for compensation (you may be entitled to
take a case in <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/small_claims_court.html">the Small Claims
Court</a> under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1980/en/act/pub/0016/index.html">Sale of
Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980</a>). </p>

<p>The Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland will also deal with
complaints from members of the public about possible misleading advertisements.
</p>

<p>You do not have to prove that claims made in the advertisement are
inaccurate. If the advertiser or trader cannot prove, on the balance of
probabilities that the claims made in the advertisement are accurate, the
advertisement will be judged to be misleading. </p>

<p>The Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland (ASAI) is an independent
self-regulatory body set up and financed by the advertising industry and
committed in the public interest to promoting the highest standards of
advertising and sales promotion. The Authority's aim is to ensure that all
commercial advertisements and promotions are "legal, decent, honest and
truthful". If you come across a commercial advertisement that you feel does not
meet these standards, you can complain to the ASAI. </p>

<p>Self-regulation involves the adoption by the advertising industry of
standards drawn up by and on behalf of all advertising interests and the
enforcement of those standards through the commitment and co-operation of
advertisers, agencies and the media. </p>

<p>The rules governing advertising are set out in the <a href="http://www.asai.ie/code/">Code of Standards for Advertising, Promotional
and Direct Marketing in Ireland</a>, drawn up by the Board of the ASAI
following detailed consultation with all relevant interests, including consumer
representatives and government departments. </p>

<p>Members of the ASAI must abide by the Codes and not publish an advertisement
or conduct a promotion that contravenes Code rules. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>General rules for advertisements</h3>

<p>Advertisements should:</p>
<ul><li>Be legal, decent, honest and truthful </li>
  <li>Be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society
  </li>
  <li>Respect the principles of fair competition generally accepted in business
  </li>
  <li>Respect the spirit as well as the letter of the Code of Advertising
    Standards </li>
  <li>Avoid bringing advertising into disrepute </li>
</ul><p>The chief responsibility for observing the Code rests with advertisers.
Other parties involved in the preparation and publication of advertisements,
for example, radio and television stations, newspapers, magazines, journals and
advertising agencies, also accept an obligation to abide by the Code. </p>

<p>Any unreasonable delay in responding to the ASAI's enquiries may be
considered a breach of the Code. </p>

<p>The ASAI will observe advertisers' requests to treat any material they
supply in strict confidence, unless the courts or an official agency acting
within its statutory powers compels its disclosure.</p>

<p>You can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.asai.ie">find out more information
about the Code on the ASAI's web site</a>.</p>

</ul><h3>Online Behavioural Advertising</h3>

<p>Since September 2013, the Code contains rules about Online Behavioural
Advertising (OBA). OBA involves the practice of collecting information from
your web browser and using the information to present online advertisementss
that are more relevant to you, when you are browsing online. Companies involved
in OBA must provide notice about the collection and use of web viewing
behaviour data for the purposes of OBA, including how web users can opt out
from receiving OBA. There is <a href="http://www.asai.ie/asai-code/appendix-3-online-behavioural-advertising/">more
information about OBA</a> and the actions you can take in relation to OBA on
the ASAI website.</p>

<h3>How complaints are investigated</h3>

<p>The complaint is evaluated initially by the Secretariat of the ASAI to
determine whether it is within the terms of reference of the Authority and
whether there is a case for investigation. Where there is a case to answer, the
advertiser or promoter (or the agency involved) is informed of the complaint
and invited to comment on it. In the light of any response, the Secretariat
prepares a recommendation to the Complaints Committee and sends a copy to the
complainant and the advertiser who have an opportunity to express further views
in the matter before it is adjudicated.</p>

<p>The ASAI Complaints Committee decides whether or not Code rules have been
breached. The Complaints Committee consists of five people who are
professionally involved in the advertising business and eight independent
members. Four of these <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ccpc.ie/">independent
members are nominated by the Competition and Consumer Protection
Commission</a>.</p>

<p>Details of the case, including the names of the advertiser and the
advertising agency involved together with the Committee's adjudication, are set
out in a Case Report, which is issued to the parties involved and released for
publication. The name of the complainant is confidential. An advertisement or
promotion that breaks the rules must be withdrawn or quickly amended. </p>

<p>The investigation procedure may be accelerated where circumstances warrant
and if a case is particularly serious, the Secretariat may request interim
action (i.e., immediate withdrawal or amendment of the advertisement), pending
the completion of the investigation. </p>

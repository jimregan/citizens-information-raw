<p>Services can range from getting a hair cut to having a house built. As a
consumer you have rights when you purchase a service but there are no hard and
fast rules. Every case is different and the solution to a problem with a
service will depend on the circumstances of the case. Many people offer
services, these can be traders, tradesmen or professionals, here we use the
term service supplier to indicate any person who supplies a service as a
business or part of a business. Here are some general guidelines that may help
you to avoid problems when you purchase a service. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>What is a contract?</h3>

<p>When you engage a service supplier you create a contract between you, as a
consumer, and the service supplier. A contract is an agreement between two or
more people that is enforceable by law. Contracts may be written or oral and
are made up of terms; some of which can be implied terms. Contracts may differ
in many ways and there are no hard and fast rules governing what terms should
be in a consumer contract. Terms in consumer contracts, however, must always be
fair and clear to the consumer. Anyone involved in the contract should be clear
about what their obligations are under the terms of the contract. </p>

<p>Consumer contracts are protected by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1980/en/act/pub/0016/index.html">Sale of
Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a contract with a service supplier you can expect that:</p>
<ul><li>The supplier has the necessary skill to provide the service </li>
  <li>The service will be provided with proper care and diligence </li>
  <li>The materials used will be sound and that goods supplied with the service
    will be of merchantable quality </li>
</ul><p>In a service contract, at the very least, you should ensure that you know
the price of the service and the time that it will take to complete the agreed
work.</p>

<p>Consumers, when they buy goods and services are protected by <a href="unfair_terms.html">unfair terms in consumer contract regulations</a>.
This means that any term or implied term in a consumer contract that is found
to be unfair to the consumer is null and void. </p>

<h3>Choosing your supplier of services</h3>

<p>When you choose a service supplier what you need to take into account will
depend on the service being provided. The following general advice may be
useful to you in choosing a service provider.</p>
<ul><li>Know what your budget is – you don’t need to disclose what you can
    afford if you are negotiating on price </li>
  <li>Be clear about what work you want carried out and put this down in
    writing. If you don’t know what you want done the service supplier is not
    likely to know either </li>
  <li>Choose a service supplier that specialises in the type and size of work
    you want carried out </li>
  <li>Get several quotes detailing specifically what work needs to be done and
    the price you will have to pay. The cheapest quote may not provide the best
    quality work </li>
  <li>If possible try to get a personal recommendation from an informed,
    experienced person. If possible, view other work that has been done, this
    will help you make your decision. Ask for previous references and follow
    them up </li>
  <li>If possible, have a written contract or agreement in place to spell out
    what work is being done, timings, costs and any other important aspects
  </li>
  <li>Work out a payments schedule that is suitable for you and the service
    supplier. Consider leaving payment (or a large instalment of payment) until
    after the job is completed and you are happy with the work </li>
  <li>Make sure you get a fully itemised receipt </li>
  <li>If there is a representative organisation for the particular trade that
    you are engaging ask if the trader is a member. Some organisations have a
    consumer complaints service and may help with any problem that may arise.
    <a shape="rect" href="../consumer_complaints/where_to_complain_about_home_improvements.html">You
    can find out more about complaining about home improvements here</a>. </li>
  <li>Make sure that you are contactable while the work is carried out so that
    the service supplier can contact you and discuss any potential problems.
  </li>
  <li>Service suppliers should be insured against damage to goods, other
    people’s property or themselves whilst carrying out a service. Check that
    any trader that you engage has appropriate insurance. </li>
  <li>You may have to pay a deposit to a service supplier to indicate that you
    intend to purchase their service. You should be clear about your and the
    service suppliers obligations if you pay a deposit. Specifically see under
    what circumstances you can get a full refund on this deposit. </li>
  <li>Ask if completed work is guaranteed – you can <a shape="rect" href="guarantees.html">read more about guarantees here</a>. A guarantee is
    additional to your rights mentioned above. </li>
</ul><h3>What to do if things go wrong</h3>

<p>If things go wrong it is always the service supplier who should put things
right. As a general rule, the service supplier can repair or replace the
service. Alternatively they can refund the costs of the service to the
consumer. <span>If you are not satisfied with the quality of goods or services
you should </span></p>
<ul><li>Act as soon as you can – a delay can indicate that you have accepted
    faulty services </li>
  <li>Do not attempt to repair what went wrong yourself or give it to anyone
    else to repair it </li>
  <li>Make sure that you have a proof of purchase (a receipt, cheque stub,
    credit card statement or invoice) </li>
  <li>Keep all evidence of damage caused by shoddy work – take photos etc
  </li>
</ul><p>It is obviously better to avoid problems so raise any concerns that you may
have as the work progresses. Where possible, make yourself available for the
trader to contact you so that he or she can raise any issues that come up. </p>

<p>If you need to make a complaint <a shape="rect" href="../consumer_complaints/how_to_make_a_consumer_complaint.html">read this
advice on making a complaint in advance</a>. You may get advice and help from
one of the trade and representative organisations listed here.</p>

<p>If you have exhausted the traders complaints mechanism you can take your
claim to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/small_claims_court.html">Small Claims
Court</a>.</p>

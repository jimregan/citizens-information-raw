<p>If an item that you have purchased is faulty, you have the right to return
the item to the retailer who should be able to repair or replace the item or
refund you the cost of the item. These rights are known as your <em>statutory
rights</em>.</p>

<p>A guarantee or warranty on a product gives additional protection and this
protection is extended to anyone who has possession of the goods during the
lifetime of the guarantee.</p>

<p>A guarantee or warranty is a written statement given by the manufacturer or
other company. The guarantee or warranty indicates that the manufacturer or
other company will repair or replace an item within a set amount of time after
it has been purchased. Guarantees are legally binding. That is, they are
<em>enforceable</em> through the courts if necessary. The written guarantee
should contain the following information:</p>
<ul><li>What goods the guarantee applies to </li>
  <li>The name and address of the person who will honour the guarantee </li>
  <li>The duration of the guarantee </li>
  <li>The procedure for making a claim under it (which may not be more
    difficult than ordinary commercial procedure) </li>
  <li>What action the guarantor undertakes to do and </li>
  <li>Whether the purchaser must pay any charges for getting the product
    repaired (such as postage and packaging). </li>
</ul><p>Products such as some household durable goods (pots and pans, furniture
etc.) and electrical goods typically come with a guarantee. Some services may
also be guaranteed. For example, work undertaken in a house (such as
damp-proofing a building) may also be guaranteed for a specific period of time.
</p>

<p>Guarantees may be used by anyone in possession of goods during the guarantee
period. Guarantees can be particularly useful if you receive a gift as you may
not need to show proof of purchase to claim the guarantee. Always check the
terms and conditions of the guarantee.</p>

<h3>Extended Warranties</h3>

<p>Some retailers may offer an extended warranty on larger electrical items,
such as a washing machine. An extended warranty covers the item or service
after the manufacturer’s guarantee period is over. It is like an insurance
policy and it is completely optional. Before you pay for an extended warranty,
think about what the cost of fixing or replacing the item would normally be.
</p>

<h3>Advice on guarantees and warranties</h3>
<ul><li>Read and fully understand the guarantee and warranty</li>
  <li>Make sure the warranty covers problems that you are likely to have </li>
  <li>Do not lose the guarantee or warranty (if you choose to get one)</li>
  <li>Remember that you have a guarantee or warranty if the item is faulty </li>
  <li>Remember that you still have your consumer rights. </li>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Guarantees are covered by Sections 15–19 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1980/en/act/pub/0016/index.html">Sale of
Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980</a>. Any term in a guarantee which makes
the retailer or guarantor the sole arbiter of whether the buyer has a claim is
void.</p>

<p>Generally, retailers and manufacturers do not charge for guarantees. There
may be a charge for an extended warranty but you should not feel obliged to pay
for an extended warranty as a guarantee and warranty supplements your consumer
rights.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>There are different terms and conditions attached to different guarantees.
It is important that you know what these terms are when you buy the product or
service and if you go to use a guarantee. You can address any queries that you
may have on guarantees to the Competition and Consumer Protection
Commission.</p>

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>Shopping from home is also known as <em>distance selling</em> and includes
purchases made by e-mail, fax, telephone, internet shopping and mail order.
Distance selling involves communication between a trader and a consumer where
they are not in each other's physical presence.</p>

<p>When you enter into a distance contract with a trader you have the right to
expect the same <a href="consumers_and_the_law_in_ireland.html">consumer
protection</a> as you would have if you bought the goods in a local shop. The
goods should be of merchantable quality, fit for the purpose intended and as
described. Because you are entering into a distance contract you have
additional protection under EU law.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/consumer-marketing/rights-contracts/directive/index_en.htm">European
Directive on consumer rights (Directive 2011/83/EU)</a> (known as the Consumer
Rights Directive) aims to ensure that consumers can expect the same minimum
level of protection no matter where a trader is based in the European Union
(EU). The Directive was incorporated into Irish law by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/si/0484.html">European Union
(Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulations 2013 (SI
484/2013)</a> with effect from 13 June 2014.</p>

<p>Remember, you are protected whether you purchase the goods in Ireland or
another member state. If you buy from a website or a catalogue based outside
the EU, any problems that arise may be more difficult to solve - so check the
terms and conditions.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Under the Consumer Rights Directive:</p>
<ul><li>Unless agreed otherwise, the trader must deliver the goods to you without
    undue delay and not later than 30 days from when the order was placed.</li>
  <li>If the trader does not deliver the goods within the time agreed, you may
    ask the trader to make the delivery within an additional period of time,
    unless it is not appropriate in the circumstances.</li>
  <li>If the trader fails to deliver the goods within the agreed time or the
    additional period (if any), you may reject the contract and the trader must
    refund all the money you paid under the contract, without undue delay.</li>
</ul><p>The Directive does not apply to certain types of contracts, including:</p>
<ul><li>Social services and healthcare contracts</li>
  <li>Gambling contracts</li>
  <li>Contracts for financial services like insurance or banking</li>
  <li>Contracts for the sale of land</li>
  <li>Contracts for the construction of new buildings or substantial
  conversions</li>
  <li>Residential accommodation rental contracts</li>
  <li>Package holiday contracts</li>
  <li>Timeshares and long-term holiday product contracts</li>
  <li>Contracts for food and drink delivered to the consumer by regular
    roundsmen (for example, milkmen). However, once-off transactions are
    covered.</li>
  <li>Contracts concluded by means of automatic vending machines or automated
    commercial premises</li>
  <li>Contracts concluded with telecommunications operators through the use of
    public payphones</li>
</ul><h3>Consumer information</h3>

<p>Before you are bound by a distance contract the trader must make certain
information available to you including:</p>
<ul><li>The trader's name and address as well as the address to which to address
    complaints</li>
  <li>The main characteristics of the goods or service</li>
  <li>The price of the goods - including all taxes</li>
  <li>Delivery costs, where applicable</li>
  <li>Arrangements for payment</li>
  <li>The trader’s complaints handling policy</li>
  <li>Whether a right to cancel exists and the conditions, time limit and
    procedures for doing so</li>
  <li>Whether you will bear the costs of returning the goods</li>
  <li>The estimated cost of returning the goods if you have to bear the cost
    and they cannot be returned by normal post</li>
  <li>Conditions of after-sale customer assistance and services, and commercial
    guarantees</li>
  <li>The duration of the contract, if applicable, and the conditions for
    terminating it if it is extended automatically or is of unlimited
  duration</li>
  <li>The minimum duration of your obligations under the contract, if
  applicable</li>
  <li>The cost of communication between you and the trader, if it is above a
    basic rate</li>
</ul><p>The information on digital content, such as downloadable films and books,
must be clear as to the compatibility of the digital content with different
hardware and software. It must also include any technical protection measures,
for example, the number of copies that can be made.</p>

<p>If a right to cancel exists, the trader must make available to you the
standard cancellation form (including cancellation rights and instructions) as
set out in the Directive.</p>

<p>Where a distance contract is concluded through a trading website, the
website must indicate clearly, and at the latest at the beginning of the
ordering process, whether any delivery restrictions apply and which means of
payment are accepted.</p>

<p>Where a distance contract is concluded by electronic means the trader must
ensure that, when placing an order, you explicitly acknowledge that the order
implies an obligation to pay. If this entails activating a button or something
similar, the trader must ensure that the button is labelled with the words
‘order with obligation to pay’ or similar, indicating that the order
entails an obligation to pay the trader. If this requirement is not complied
with, you are not bound by the contract.</p>

<h3>Additional payments</h3>

<p>The use of default options, for example, pre-ticked boxes, which you are
required to change in order to avoid paying for some additional service or item
is not allowed. You must actively select such options otherwise you do not have
to pay. If there is a dispute, the trader is required to prove that he sought
your express consent to the additional payment.</p>

<h3>Fees and charges</h3>

<p>A trader cannot charge you more for using a particular means of payment,
such as a credit card, than the cost to the trader for using that means of
payment. If there is a dispute, the trader is required to prove they are
compliant with the Directive.</p>

<p>Similarly, if a trader operates a telephone helpline, the trader cannot
charge you more than the basic telephone rate for calls to it.</p>

<h3>Confirmation of contract</h3>

<p>The trader must provide confirmation of the concluded contract to you in a
durable format, such as a letter or email. It should include the information
mentioned above, if not already supplied in a durable format. It should be
provided within a reasonable time after the contract was concluded, and at the
latest:</p>
<ul><li>When the goods are being delivered or</li>
  <li>Before a service is provided</li>
</ul><h3>Cooling-off period</h3>

<p>You are entitled to a cooling-off period of 14 days, which begins on the day
that you receive the goods. In the case of a service, the cooling-off period
begins on the day the contract for distance selling was concluded.</p>

<p>In the case of digital content, the cooling-off period expires when the
downloading or streaming starts.</p>

<p>During the cooling-off period, you can cancel a distance contract without
giving a reason and without incurring charges or penalties, other than possible
charges incurred in returning the goods.</p>

<p>If a trader fails to provide you with information on the right to cancel,
the cooling-off period is extended to 12 months from the date it would have
expired if the information had been provided. If the trader provides the
information within this 12-month period, the cooling-off period expires within
14 days of the consumer receiving it.</p>

<h3>Cancellation</h3>

<p>To cancel the contract, you must inform the trader of the decision to cancel
using either the prescribed cancellation form, or some other method, before the
cooling-off period expires. There is no requirement to give a reason for
cancelling. If there is a dispute, it is up to you to prove the cancellation
was carried out correctly.</p>

<p>You must send the goods back within 14 days of informing the trader of the
cancellation. You have to pay for the cost of returning the goods unless you
were not informed before ordering that you would have to bear the cost.</p>

<p>Upon cancellation, the trader is obliged to repay all payments you made,
including delivery charges, within 14 days. If you choose a more expensive type
of delivery than the trader’s cheapest standard delivery, you are only
entitled to be refunded the cost of the cheaper delivery type. The trader can
withhold repayment until the goods are returned or you supply evidence that you
have sent the goods back.</p>

<p>Once the contract is cancelled, any credit agreements entered into at the
time of the contract are cancelled as well.</p>

<p>Cancellation will not be accepted in certain cases including where:</p>
<ul><li>The provision of services have already begun with your agreement</li>
  <li>The price of the goods or services is dependent upon financial market
    fluctuations that are beyond the trader's control</li>
  <li>The goods cannot be returned because they were made according to your
    specifications or were personalised for you</li>
  <li>The goods are liable to deteriorate or expire rapidly</li>
  <li>The goods seals have been broken by you and cannot be returned for health
    protection and hygiene reasons</li>
  <li>The goods are audio/video tapes or computer software whose seals have
    been broken by you</li>
  <li>The goods are newspapers or magazines</li>
  <li>The goods were purchased at a public auction</li>
</ul><h3>Tax payable on goods</h3>

<p>If you buy goods online or by mail from another EU Member State you may pay
VAT at the rate that applies in Ireland. However, if the supplier that you are
buying the goods from has not exceeded the <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vat/guide/registration.html#section2">Distance
Sales Threshold</a> in Ireland then you will pay VAT at the rate appropriate to
that product in the Member State of purchase. You will usually be informed of
the amount of VAT payable at checkout.</p>

<p>Goods ordered from outside the EU that cost more than €22 may be liable
for VAT. If they cost more than €150 they may also be liable for customs
duty.</p>

<p>Excise duty and VAT are chargeable on excisable products such as alcohol and
alcoholic beverages, tobacco and tobacco products and mineral oils forwarded
from other member states of the EU.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/customs/leaflets/pn1882.html">more information
on Revenue’s website</a>.</p>

<p>If you return the goods you purchased, you may be able to reclaim the taxes
and duties charged providing you have the required paperwork. Contact <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/contact/index.html">your local Revenue
office</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Credit card fraud</h3>

<p>If your credit card has been used fraudulently, you can cancel any payments
made under a distance contract and you are entitled to the return of those
payments immediately. Payments can be cancelled by contacting the bank or
building society where you hold your credit card. You should always keep the
telephone number in a safe place in case you need it.</p>

<p>If you discover (or even suspect) that your card has been used in a
fraudulent manner, then you should contact the relevant financial institution
straight away.</p>

<p>If your card has been used fraudulently, your liability cannot exceed €150
under <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31997H0489:EN:HTML">EU
Recommendation 97/489/EC</a>. However, in Ireland, in practice the liability is
generally lower.</p>

<h3>Inertia selling</h3>

<p>It is illegal for a trader to demand payment for unsolicited services. Book
clubs are a very good example of inertia selling and the most common kind. If a
trader sends you an item that you did not order and does not provide for return
post, it cannot then try to invoice you for the product or initiate debt
collection proceedings against you.</p>

<p>However, if you are contracted to a trader and receive unwanted books or
CDs, you should check your contract as it may contain a term that commits you
to receiving 4 or 5 items a year. If this is the case, the trader's actions
cannot be considered inertia selling. It is therefore very important for you to
read the contract carefully before committing yourself to it.</p>

<h3>Waiving your rights as a consumer</h3>

<p>You cannot waive the rights conferred on you by the Consumer Rights
Directive.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lb09df">Complaints</h2>

<p>When making a complaint, you should firstly contact the trader and inform
them of your complaint. If you are not satisfied with the response, you may be
able to get help with your complaint.</p>

<p>If your complaint is against a trader here in Ireland, then you should
complain to the <a href="http://www.ccpc.ie/about/what-we-do">Competition and
Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)</a>, which has responsibility for
enforcing the Regulations. The CCPC can appoint officers to search, inspect and
remove documents from the premises of offending traders.</p>

<p>If a trader fails to comply with legal obligations, then the distance
contract will be rendered unenforceable. The supplier is then exposed to the
risk of criminal prosecution and fines of up to €60,000 or up to 18 months in
prison, or to both.</p>

<p>If the trader is in another EU member state, you can contact the <a href="http://www.eccireland.ie/">European Consumer Centre Ireland (ECC
Ireland)</a> which is part of the <a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/consumers/consumer_information/l32048_en.htm">European
Consumer Centres Network (ECC-Net)</a> and it may contact the trader and try to
resolve your dispute. If appropriate, ECC Ireland may forward your case to an
<a href="../consumer_complaints/alternative_dispute_resolution_in_ireland.html">alternative
dispute resolution (ADR)</a> organisation in the other country. ADR should be
considered, before legal action, as an opportunity to settle a dispute out of
court, if your attempts to resolve the dispute directly with a trader proved
unsuccessful. You can get further information on ADR in the EU by contacting
ECC Ireland.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2015/en/si/0500.html">online
dispute resolution (ODR) Regulation (SI 500/2015)</a> came into effect on 9
January 2016. A new <a href="https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home.show&amp;lng=EN">online
ODR platform</a> developed and operated by the European Commission acts as a
single point of contact for consumers and traders, within the EU, who seek to
resolve disputes arising from online shopping.</p>

<p>If the trader is based outside the EU, you can direct your complaint to <a href="https://www.econsumer.gov/en/FileAComplaint#crnt">Econsumer.gov</a> after
you have tried to solve the problem directly with the seller. Econsumer.gov
also tries to protect consumers from internet scams.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="leb1f9">Information </h2>

<p>There are a number of statutory and voluntary consumer bodies. These bodies
are there to inform you of your rights as a consumer and to help you enforce
these rights. The following information describes the main organisations that
can advise you of your rights as a consumer. Information is included on bodies
that provide consumer services to purchasers of goods and services in Ireland
and in other EU member states. There are also a number of other regulatory and
representative bodies for specific businesses that have a role in protecting
the consumer. These are described in the relevant areas throughout the consumer
portal. </p>

<p>As every consumer case is different, it is useful to consult the appropriate
organisation that may advise you on your rights and entitlements.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you have a consumer complaint you should always begin by contacting the
supplier of the goods or the provider of the service first. Often, issues can
be easily remedied by speaking to the retailer or the proprietor. If they
cannot or will not help even after you have put your complaint in writing, you
can contact the relevant body for information. Depending on the value of the
goods or service, you may eventually need to consider going to Courts (<a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/small_claims_court.html">Small Claims
Court</a>) or to <a shape="rect" href="../consumer_complaints/alternative_dispute_resolution_in_ireland.html">arbitration
or mediation</a> to seek a remedy. </p>

<p>In advance of taking any action you should ensure that you have the correct
information. Any of the bodies listed in this section will advise you on your
rights and what steps to take to claim redress.</p>

<p>Different consumer bodies have different responsibilities when it comes to
consumer rights. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)
which replaced the National Consumer Agency, for example, deals with consumer
complaints and policy at a national level. The European Consumer Centre (ECC)
Ireland deals with consumer complaints in a cross border context. The
Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has responsibility to provide
consumer information on financial services.The <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/financial_institutions/central_bank_and_financial_services_authority_of_ireland.html">Central
Bank of Ireland</a> is responsible for the regulation of all financial services
firms.  </p>

<h3>Competition and Consumer Protection Commission </h3>

Agency and the Competition Authority were replaced by the Competition and

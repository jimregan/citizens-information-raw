<p>There are specific rules in Ireland and the EU to protect children from
playing with unsafe toys. Specific rules also exist for ensuring the safety of
children’s products, for example, baby prams, pushchairs, pacifiers
(soothers), cots and clothing. Equipment such as swings, slides, pencils and
pens are also regulated. Most of these rules are based on the standards which
are developed by the European Committee for standardisation (CEN). The National
Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) develops standards governing safety,
quality, design, performance of specific products for sale in Ireland.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Since 1990, legislation has been in place in Ireland which prohibits the
placing of toys on the market unless they meet minimum safety requirements.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/si/0014.html">European
Communities (Safety of Toys) Regulations 2011 (SI 14/2011)</a> (as amended)
transposed <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:02009L0048-20140721&amp;from=EN">Directive
2009/48/EC</a> (as amended) on the safety of toys. The Directive prohibits the
placing of toys on the market unless they are safe, and updates the safety
requirements. It also sets down a requirement to ensure risk assessment is
carried out for toys.</p>

<p>Toys placed on the market prior to the making of these Regulations are
covered by <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/si/0032.html">SI
32/1990</a> which sets out the safety requirements for toys applicable. </p>

<p>In addition, EU rules state that any product offered for sale in the EU that
conforms with certain specific health, safety and environmental protection
standards must carry a CE mark. The CE mark is a declaration by the producer
that the product conforms to all the applicable EU legislation. <a shape="rect" href="http://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/ce-marking/index_en.htm">Read
about the the CE mark</a>. </p>

<h3>What is a toy?</h3>

<p>A toy is defined in the law as a product intended for children aged under 14
to play with. It does not include products listed in Annex I of <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:170:0001:0037:en:PDF">Directive
2009/48/EC (pdf)</a></p>

<p>Equipment children may use (such as sports equipment) that are not toys come
under the General Product Safety Directive.</p>

<h3>General guidelines for buying safe products for children</h3>

<p>The following are some basic guidelines when buying safe products and toys.
Items should be:</p>
<ul><li>strong and resilient (i.e., should not break easily) </li>
  <li>made of materials that do not burn easily </li>
  <li>made of non-toxic materials </li>
  <li>carry the CE mark </li>
</ul><p>A child’s product that contains detachable or small parts should be marked
as unsuitable for children under 36 months. Any specific hazard that exists
should be drawn to your attention. </p>

<p>Bicycles and go-karts etc. should have adequate brakes and guards for chains
and other moving parts. If being used on public roads, <a href="../../../travel_and_recreation/vehicle_standards/lighting_of_bicycles_in_ireland.html">bicycles
should carry adequate lighting</a>. </p>

<h3>Safe use of children’s products</h3>

<p>It is common sense to ensure that toys are <span>used</span> safely. Toys
with a CE mark indicate that they are safe to use as they were intended to be.
That is, for the age group they are considered appropriate to. </p>

<p>For example, a toy suitable for a ten year old can be dangerous if played
with by a three year old.</p>

<h3>Electrical toys</h3>

<p>Electrical toys should carry the CE mark to ensure compliance with EU safety
standards. No electrical toy should be sold (or given out for free) that
exceeds 24 volts. Electrical items (such as lamps etc.) exist that are intended
to appeal to children but these are most definitely NOT toys and should carry a
label accordingly worded. All parts of the toy should be properly insulated to
prevent a risk of contact with live wires. Safety instructions on electrical
toys should be clear and precise and should be heeded by consumers.</p>

<h3>Toys and children’s product labelling</h3>

<p>The following information should appear on the packaging or the product
itself</p>
<ul><li>The CE mark </li>
  <li>Name, trade mark and address of the manufacturer, his agent or importer
    within the European Union </li>
  <li>Instructions for use, if any </li>
  <li>Advice on the safe use of the toy (such as ‘unsuitable for children
    under 36 months’) </li>
</ul><p>The Irish technical standard mark can be placed on the toy along with the CE
mark. This indicates that the toy complies with all safety regulations. The
most common Standard for Toys is called IS EN 71.</p>

<p>If you suspect that a toy is unsafe you should contact the Competition and
Consumer Protection Commission(CCPC) who will investigate the matter.
Similarly, if you or a child has been harmed by a toy, you should also contact
the CCPC for advice and information. You can find more information in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nca.ie/media/GuidetoToySafety1.pdf">CCPC's

<p>To protect consumers’ health and safety, laws exist that ensure producers
or importers of goods must only place safe products on the market in the
European Union. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/si/0199.html">S.I. no 199 of 2004
European Communities (General Product Safety) Regulations</a> prohibits the
placing of unsafe goods on the Irish market. This means that any product made
available to buy, must not present any undue risk to the consumer under its
normal use. In addition, certain categories of products are covered by sector
specific legislation and product specific provisions. </p>

<p>Specific safety rules exist for food products that are administered by the
Food Safety Authority of Ireland. <a shape="rect" href="../../food/">Read more
about food safety here</a>. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nsai.ie">National Standards Authority
of Ireland (NSAI)</a> is Ireland’s national standards body. Their role is to
develop standards governing safety, quality, design, performance etc. of
specific products for sale in Ireland. Any product for sale here that has a
standard, must reach the minimum requirements set out in that standard.
Products with safety standards might include items such as children’s cots or
stair gates. Standards are developed by the NSAI in consultation with producers
and consumers. The NSAI also examines best international practice with regard
to product safety. The NSAI develops these standards to protect consumers from
buying dangerous or substandard goods. </p>

<p>The European Union also aims to protect consumers from <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/consumers_safety/international_cooperation/index_en.htm">unsafe
products manufactured outside the European Union</a>. </p>

<h3>Using products safely</h3>

<p>Sometimes, risks are associated with products arising from their normal use.
These risks are called ‘inherent risks’. Candles, for example, can present
inherent risks if care is not taken to use them properly. They are, however,
quite safe when used properly and with care. In such cases, producers must warn
consumers of any dangers associated with improper use of the product. Warnings
such as ‘Never leave a naked flame unattended’ should appear on the
packaging to highlight this danger. </p>

<p>If you are harmed by a defective product, the producer, importer, and in
certain circumstances, the supplier may be liable for the damage caused. In
evaluating whether a product is defective, the main criteria used are the
product’s presentation and the use to which it could reasonably be put. A
product is deemed defective only after taking into account the circumstances of
its use. This means that if a product is used improperly that it may not be
deemed to be defective.</p>

<h3>How do I know if a product is safe?</h3>

<p>The CE mark on a product signifies that the product conforms to all EU
Directives and health, safety and environmental protection standards. Any
product that is covered by an EU Directive must carry a CE mark. The CE marking
must be affixed, indelibly to the product. However, where this is not possible
on account of the nature of the product, it must be affixed to the packaging.
<a shape="rect" href="http://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/ce-marking/index_en.htm">Read
more about the CE mark.</a></p>

<p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is responsible for
market surveillance to ensure compliance with the General Product Safety
Directive. If you would like to report a product that you feel is unsafe
contact the CCPC.</p>

<p>You can read more about specific product safety rules for certain categories
of products – these include: </p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="safety_of_toys_and_products_made_for_children.html">Toys, and other
    products made especially for children</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="safety_of_electrical_and_gas_products_and_furniture.html">Domestic
    gas and electrical items and furniture</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="safety_of_personal_protective_equipment.html">Personal protective
    equipment</a> </li>
</ul><h3>Product Recalls</h3>

<p>Producers are forbidden from placing dangerous products on the EU market. If
a product on the market is found to be dangerous, it is withdrawn or
‘recalled’. This occurs when items for sale or already sold to consumers
are taken back by the manufacturer as they are found to be unsafe for
consumers. </p>

<p>Consumers who have purchased unsafe items are entitled to a refund or a
replacement. If possible, the company will contact you and other consumers of
the dangerous product directly. Alternatively it will place advertisements in
the national media or press to highlight the recall. The Competition and
Consumer Protection Commission maintains <a shape="rect" href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/product-recalls">details of recalled
products</a> on its <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nca.ie/">website</a>.</p>

<p>The European Commission gives guidance to manufacturers on how to organise a
product recall. <a shape="rect" href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/consumers_safety/safety_products/rapex/index_en.htm">Details
of all products that have been recalled in the EU are displayed on the RAPEX
website</a>. RAPEX, stands for the Rapid Alert System for Non Food Products.
This rapid alert system covers all products likely to be use by consumers
except for food and medicines (which have similar but separate systems). This
system ensures rapid communication between Member States if an item is found to
be unsafe. </p>

<p>Dangerous Foodstuffs are usually recalled through the national food
authorities. (In Ireland, this is the Food Safety Authority). The Food Safety
Authority website has <a shape="rect" href="http://www.fsai.ie/news_centre/alerts.html">details of alert
notifications and product recalls</a>. </p>

<p>Dangerous medicines in Ireland are usually recalled through the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hpra.ie/#">Health Products Regulatory
Authority</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://health.gov.ie/">Department
of Health</a>. </p>

<p>If you have concerns about the safety of any product you can contact the
Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC). The CCPC carries out
market surveillance to ensure compliance with product safety laws. It has the
power to order the removal of unsafe products from the market and to prosecute
producers or importers of unsafe products. </p>

<p>You can find more information on product safety on the <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/product-safety">CCPC website</a> and on the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/consumers_safety/product_safety_legislation/index_en.htm">European
Commission website</a>.</p>

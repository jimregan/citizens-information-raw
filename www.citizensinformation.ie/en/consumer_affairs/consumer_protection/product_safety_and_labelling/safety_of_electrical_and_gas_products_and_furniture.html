<p>Electrical and gas products for sale and in use throughout the EU are
subject to safety standards. These standards aim to protect consumers and
prevent or reduce the risk of injury to anyone using these products. The
following is an overview of the main provisions of the law concerning these
standards. </p>

<h3>Electrical Products</h3>

<p>EU and Irish legislation sets down safety standards for electrical products
in use and for sale in Ireland and throughout the EU member states. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/si/0428.html">S.I 428 of 1992 The
Low Voltage Electrical Equipment Directive</a> and <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/si/0307.html">subsequent
amendments (S.I. No 307 of 1994)</a> aim to ensure that all electrical
equipment placed on the market in the European Union complies with health and
safety standards. In general, electrical equipment for use at home must not
unduly endanger people, domestic animals or property. Specifically, electrical
products must not give rise to hazards either by:</p>
<ul><li>the equipment itself (for example, an electrical product overheating and
    so becoming a hazard) </li>
</ul><p>OR</p>
<ul><li>the equipment’s interaction with the environment (for example a product
    being dangerous when carrying out its purpose – a kettle leaking and so
    becoming a hazard when water is being boiled) </li>
</ul><p>The law states that electrical equipment can be presumed to be safe but must
be used for the purposes for which it is intended. Consumers therefore, should
heed warnings that appear on products. (For example, warnings on hairdryers
such as ‘not for use in bathrooms’ etc). </p>

<p>As plugs, sockets and leads in Ireland are different to the rest of Europe
the National Standards Authority of Ireland has developed electricity standards
to ensure that safety standards are met. The specific standards covering them
are:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1969/en/si/0222.html">SI 222 1969 (IS
    167) Electrical Appliances – Colour code for three core leads</a> and
  </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1987/en/si/0173.html">SI 173 1987 (IS
    401) Safety Requirements for Rewireable 13 A Fused Plugs for normal and
    rough use having insulation sleeves on line and neutral pins</a>. </li>
</ul><p>The standard plugs in Ireland are 3 pin IS411 (BS 1363) type. You are
entitled to expect that any electrical item that you buy in Ireland comes with
a 3 pin plug. If it does not the item may be considered "not fit for its
purpose" as per the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1980/en/act/pub/0016/index.html">Sale of
Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980</a>. Never attempt to place a two pin
plug in a three pin socket. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.esb.ie/main/safety/safety-in-the-home.jsp">The Electricity
Supply Board has more information on Safety in the Home</a></p>

<h3>Gas Appliances</h3>

<p>Gas burning appliances are also subject to stringent standards to ensure
that they are safe for use in the home. A gas burning appliance covers items
such as household heating boilers, gas cookers, gas lighting, gas-fired
heaters, etc. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/si/0101.html">SI no 101 of
1992</a> and <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/si/0150.html">SI No 150 of
1995</a> lay out the requirements for manufacturers of gas burning appliances.
</p>

<p>The requirements set down the standards regarding warning notices to be
affixed to these appliances, the type of gas to be used, pressure levels, etc.
All gas appliances produced since 1997 in use in the EU should carry <a shape="rect" href="http://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/ce-marking/index_en.htm">the CE
mark</a> to show that they comply with these laws. </p>

<p>If you are having a gas appliance fitted it is a legal requirement that the
installation be carried out by a <a href="http://www.bordgaisnetworks.ie/en-IE/Safety/Using-a-registered-gas-installer/">registered
gas installer</a>. The Commission for Energy Regulation has appointed the <a href="http://www.rgii.ie/about-us/the-rgii-register.2713.html">Register of Gas
Installers of Ireland (RGII)</a> as the gas safety supervisory body. Companies
working on gas installations, fitting of gas appliances or providing appliance
servicing must be registered with RGII. To be registered the installer must
meet the safety training and other requirements. </p>

<h3>The CE Label</h3>

<p>All electrical products and gas appliances should have a CE mark. The CE
label means that the product conforms with all applicable health, safety and
environmental protection standards of the European Union and of the Member
State in which the item was bought. The CE mark can appear on the item itself
or on the packaging. Look for the CE mark before you buy electrical or gas
products.</p>

<h3>Fire Safety for furniture</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/si/0316.html">Under S.I. 316 of
1995 the Industrial Research and Standards (Fire Safety) (Domestic Furniture)
Order 1995</a> anyone manufacturing, selling or repairing furniture in Ireland
is obliged to ensure materials used (including foams, fillings, coverings and
frames) comply with safety standards. Specifically, furniture must pass the
‘cigarette test’. This test proves that covers, foam and lining materials
are not likely to go on fire by a lit match or a cigarette. All furniture
passing this test should be clearly labelled to indicate that it complies with
Irish fire safety laws.</p>

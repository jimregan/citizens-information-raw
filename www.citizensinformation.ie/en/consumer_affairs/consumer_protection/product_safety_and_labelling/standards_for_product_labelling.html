<p>Labels on products and goods inform you about the characteristics of the
product or item. For example, labels on food inform you about the nutritional
value and weight of the food. Labels on clothing inform you about the size of
the garment, what it is made of etc. Information on labels allows you to make
an informed choice about what you are intending to buy. There are rules in
Ireland and the EU regarding labels on products. These rules mainly relate to
textiles and footwear although other areas are also covered. You can find
information on the rules for the labelling of food on the <a shape="rect" href="http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/foodlabelling/index_en.htm">EU
Commission's website</a> and the <a href="https://www.fsai.ie/legislation/food_legislation/food_information_fic/food_information-fic.html">Food
Safety Authority's website</a>.</p>

<p>Manufacturers of products and goods must comply with the laws on labelling.
While the law sets down some minimum requirements, there is nothing to prevent
additional information being given on labels, so long as it is true. For
example, instructions on how to cook or serve food items are not required. Most
food labels carry this information even though they are not required.</p>

<p>There is no legal requirement for producers of non-food items for example,
clothing, etc.) to show the country of origin on the label. This means the
manufacturer is not obliged to state that an item was made in Ireland or
abroad. Labels instructing you how to wash and maintain items may be desirable
on an item but are not required by law. In other words, manufacturers are not
obliged to put washing or any maintenance instructions on goods, but they can
if they wish.</p>

<p>When you are shopping, check the item you are buying is correctly labelled.
Be aware that, sometimes, labels can be misleading. For example, just because
the packaging is environmentally friendly does not mean that a product is
better for the environment. In that case, you should look for a label stating a
product is, for example, ‘made from recycled material’.</p>

<h3>Fairtrade</h3>

<p>Items marked 'Fairtrade' must meet international Fairtrade standards which
are set by the international certification body <a href="http://www.fairtrade.net/">Fairtrade Labelling Organisations
International (FLO)</a>. These standards are agreed with key participants in
the Fairtrade scheme, including producers themselves and labelling
organisations such as <a href="http://www.fairtrade.ie/home.html">Fairtrade
Ireland</a>. If you find items marked Fairtrade that you feel are misleading,
get in touch with Fairtrade Ireland.</p>

<h3>Organic</h3>

<p>Since July 2010 the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/organic/eu-policy/logo_en">EU organic
logo</a> is obligatory for all organic pre-packaged food products within the
European Union. It may also be used for non-pre-packaged organic goods produced
within the EU or organic products imported from third countries. Each EU member
state has established an inspection system and designated a number of public
authorities and/or approved private inspection bodies to carry out the
inspection and certification of organic production. The <a href="http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/farmingsectors/organicfarming/">Department
of Agriculture, Food and the Marine</a> has approved <a href="http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/farmingsectors/organicfarming/advicefromorganicorganisations/organicinspectionbodies/">five
certification bodies</a> to carry out this work in Ireland, that is, Institute
of Marketecology (IMO), Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association (IOFGA),
Organic Trust Limited, BDAA-Demeter UK and Global Trust Certification Limited.
All products labelled as organic must bear the name of the last operator who
has handled the product, for example, the producer, the processor or the
distributor and the name or code number of their inspection body. If you find
items marked organic you feel are misleading, get in touch with these
organisations for guidance.</p>

<h3>The CE label</h3>

<p>The CE label on a product is a white rectangular label with the letters CE
in black lettering. The CE label means that the product conforms with all
health, safety and environmental protection standards of the European Union
laid down in the relevant sectorial or vertical directives. Not all products
are covered by the CE marking.</p>

<p>CE labelling was introduced in the EU to standardise labelling regulations
across the member states. The mark is required on a wide range of products.
Examples range from electrical equipment, refrigerators and gas water heaters
to helmets, toys and heart pacemakers. <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/ce-marking/index_en.htm">View
more information on the CE label</a>.</p>

<h3>Textile labelling</h3>

<p>Textile products for sale in the EU should be labelled by reference to their
fibre content whenever they are put onto the market for production or
commercial purposes. This law is set down in the European Union (Textile Fibre
Names and Related Labelling and Marking of the Fibre Composition of Textile
Products) Regulations 2012 (<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/si/0142.html">SI 142 of 2012</a>).
These Regulations were made to give effect to <a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/consumers/product_labelling_and_packaging/mi0088_en.htm">EU
Regulation 1007/2011</a> as amended by <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:095:0001:0006:EN:PDF">EU
Regulation No. 286/2012</a>. These Regulations apply to products entirely made
of textile fibres such as clothes, curtains or bed linen. It also applies to
products containing at least 80% textile components such as furniture, umbrella
and sunshade coverings, floor coverings, mattresses and camping goods, the warm
linings of footwear, gloves, mittens and mitts. There is no legal obligation to
show care labels, however, if these are shown they must be accurate.</p>

<p>In many instances the labels on textiles must show the percentages of
materials contained in the item. For example, clothing may be labelled ‘100%
cotton’ or ‘50% wool, 50% acrylic’. Again, these labels tell you more
about the product and can inform your decision about purchasing or not.</p>

<h3>Footwear labelling</h3>

<p>There are also important rules regarding how various parts of footwear are
labelled. These labels often appear as stickers on the base of the footwear or
on the shoebox or inside the footwear. The information about what the footwear
is made of must be conveyed by means of agreed pictures or symbols or text. The
European Communities (Labelling of Footwear) Regulations 1996 (<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/si/0063.html">SI 63 of 1996</a>)
sets down the rules about footwear labels. It gave effect to <a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/consumers/product_labelling_and_packaging/l21209_en.htm">EU
Directive 94/11/EC</a>.</p>

<p>The law sets out how the various parts of the footwear (that is, the upper
part, lining, outer-sole) item must be labelled. Information must be given
about the material which makes up at least 80 % of the surface area of the
upper, the lining and insole sock of the footwear article, and at least 80 % of
the volume of the outer-sole.</p>

<p>If no one material accounts for at least 80 % of the footwear, the label
must state the two principal materials the footwear is made of (for example,
20% rubber, 60% leather, etc.).</p>

<p>As the aim of both the above laws is to provide information, all labels must
be legible. The manufacturer or their authorised agent in the European Union is
responsible for supplying the labels and for the accuracy of the information
contained in them.</p>

<p>Personal Protective Equipment is any device or appliance designed to protect
against health and safety hazards in your daily activities. Personal protective
equipment covers a broad range of items from simple devices like sunglasses,
bicycle helmets and reflective jackets to chemical hazard suits and safety
harnesses. </p>

<p>A specific law (<a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/si/0272.html">S.I. No 272 of 1993
EC (Personal Protective Equipment) Regulations, 1993)</a> (as amended) covers
these items. The law states that all personal protective equipment must
preserve health and ensure the safety of users. Personal protective equipment
must not harm other people, domestic animals or property. All of these items
should be properly maintained by the user and used for their intended purposes.
Attached warnings and instructions should always be followed.</p>

<p>The law covers all personal protective equipment whether it is used in the
home, for leisure purposes or at work. The Competition and Consumer Protection
Commission has responsibility to check that personal protective equipment used
in leisure pursuits or in the home complies with the law. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Topics/Personal_Protective_Equipment_-_PPE/">The
Health and Safety Authority Monitors all personal protective equipment used in
business and industry</a>. </p>

<p>The use of safety equipment on any mechanically-propelled pleasure craft is
covered by the Merchant Shipping (Mechanically Propelled Pleasure Craft)
(Safety) Regulations, 2001 and the Merchant Shipping (Pleasure Craft)
(Lifejackets and Operation) (Safety) Regulations 2004. This includes
motorboats, powerboats, fast powerboats (those than can travel at a speed of 17
knots) and personal watercraft, commonly referred to as jet skis. You can <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/recreational_activities_in_ireland/sport_and_leisure/licensing_of_boats_and_watercraft_in_ireland.html">read
more about personal protective equipment on pleasure craft here</a>. </p>

<p>The European Commission has information on <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/mechanical-engineering/personal-protective-equipment/index_en.htm">personal

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.comreg.ie/">Commission for
Communications Regulation (ComReg)</a> was established as the national
regulatory authority for the postal sector by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2002/en/act/pub/0020/index.html">Communications
Regulation Act 2002</a>. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.anpost.ie/AnPost/">An
Post</a> was designated Ireland’s <em>universal service provider</em> by the
<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0021/index.html">Communications
Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011</a> for a period of 12 years from August
2011. The 2011 Act also enacted into Irish law <a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/internal_market/single_market_services/l24166_en.htm">EU
Directive 97/67/EC as amended</a>.</p>

<p>The universal service provider is obliged to provide certain services. While
other postal service providers operate in Ireland, only An Post is obliged to
provide specific services. </p>

<h3>Postal service providers</h3>

<p>Anyone can set up a postal business to handle any form of mail. If you want
to provide a postal service you must notify ComReg. A postal service involves
the clearance, sorting, transport and distribution of postal packets. Services
such as document exchange, courier services and the delivery of unaddressed
advertising material are not considered to be postal services. When completing
the notification form, you will have to decide whether your postal service is
within the scope of the universal postal service.</p>

<p>When you receive an acknowledgement from ComReg of the notification, you are
authorised to provide the postal service described in your notification,
subject to the conditions of authorisation. You are required to draw up a code
of practice covering customer complaints and redress.</p>

<p>ComReg provides <a href="http://www.comreg.ie/industry/postal-regulation/authorised-postal-providers/authorised-postal-providers-register/">more
information on the regulation of authorised providers</a> on its website.</p>

<h3>Universal service provider </h3>

<p>As the universal service provider, An Post must provide a universal service
to everyone and every organisation in the State. This involves at least one
collection and one delivery five working days a week (that is, Monday to
Friday) of postal packets weighing up to 2kgs and parcels weighing up to 20
kgs. It must provide the following services:</p>
<ul><li>A single piece service involving the clearance, sorting, transport and
    distribution of letters, large envelopes, packets and parcels</li>
  <li>Free certificates of posting</li>
  <li>A registered items service</li>
  <li>An insured items service</li>
  <li>A single piece service provided free of charge to the postal service user
    for the transmission of postal packets for the blind or partially
  sighted</li>
  <li>A service for the clearance, transport and distribution of:<br>
    - Postal packets deposited in bulk for delivery only<br>
    - Postal packets deposited in bulk pre-sorted by country of destination
    abroad<br>
    - Postal packets deposited in bulk for deferred delivery</li>
  <li>A service for the clearance, transport and distribution of postal packets
    deposited with the universal postal service provider by a foreign
    designated postal operator</li>
  <li>A number of special facilities for the delivery of postal packets,
    provided at the request of the addressee, including: <br>
    - Redirection<br>
    - Business Reply<br>
    - Freepost</li>
</ul><p>Full details of the postal services that An Post must provide nationally and
internationally are set out in the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/si/0280.html">Communications
Regulation (Universal Postal Service) Regulations 2012 (SI 280 of 2012)</a>.
</p>

<h3>An Post’s other services </h3>

<p>An Post also provides postal services that do not fall under the universal
service requirement as well as services that are not postal services. Examples
of the non-postal services are Express Post, Passport Express, Philatelic
Services (dealing with stamps) and Courier Post. It also has other services,
such as, financial services, collecting TV licence fees and business
directories. </p>

<p>Information on all of An Post’s services, as well as the services
available through the network of local post offices is available on <a shape="rect" href="http://www.anpost.ie/AnPost/">An Post’s website</a>. </p>

<h3>Monitoring of postal services </h3>

<p>ComReg monitors An Post’s compliance with its legal obligations as
universal service provider with regard to the:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.comreg.ie/industry/postal-regulation/regulation-of-an-post/regulation-of-price/">Price
    of the services</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.comreg.ie/industry/postal-regulation/regulation-of-an-post/regulation-of-quality/">Quality
    of the services</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.comreg.ie/industry/postal-regulation/regulation-of-an-post/regulation-of-services/">Range
    of services</a></li>
</ul><p>it provides and may issue directions to An Post, after consultation with
interested parties. ComReg may also initiate enforcement procedures if
appropriate.</p>

<p>ComReg is required to measure the quality of service provided by An Post,
and to publish regular reports. There is an official European Standard
(EN13850) setting out how this should be done. The measurement is continuous
and results of An Post's performance are reported in information notices
published by ComReg each quarter. The measurement relates to single piece mail
only, i.e., performance of large scale or bulk mailings are excluded from this
measurement. ComReg has set targets of 94% for next day delivery and 99.5% for
delivery within 3 days. The most recent results achieved are available on <a shape="rect" href="http://www.comreg.ie/industry/postal-regulation/">ComReg's
website</a>.</p>

<p>ComReg’s regulatory role for An Post’s postal services that do not fall
under the universal service requirement is much more limited. It can only make
sure that An Post has adequate complaints procedures in the provision of these
services and that there is no cross-subsidy between these and the universal
services. </p>

<p>ComReg has no regulatory role over An Post’s non-postal services. They are
subject to normal commercial law. </p>

<p>ComReg ensures that other postal service providers who have a postal service
authorisation from ComReg draw up a code of practice covering customer
complaints and redress. </p>

<h3>Parcels from abroad </h3>

<p>If a parcel or package comes from outside the European Union (EU), you must
pay the VAT and any duties that you owe, before the parcel is delivered to you.
If the parcel comes from another EU country, it is not subject to VAT or
duties, as these are already included in the price of the goods within the
parcel. </p>

<p>The manner in which VAT and customs duties are collected depends on the
company that delivers the package and varies from one provider to another. One
of three situations may apply:</p>
<ul><li>The delivery provider pays the fee to clear the item from customs and
    then charges you directly </li>
  <li>The delivery provider tells you the relevant charge and asks for payment
    before delivering the package to you </li>
  <li>The delivery provider lets you deal directly with the Revenue
    Commissioners </li>
</ul><p>The amount charged for clearing postal items through customs is up to the
delivery provider and can vary from one provider to another. Usually these
charges are based on a percentage of the value of the goods stated to be in the
package. You should contact the delivery provider for a list of the charges.
</p>

<h3>Postcodes</h3>

<p>In July 2015, a new national postcode system known as <a href="eircode.html">Eircode</a> was introduced. All residential and business
addresses have been given a unique new Eircode. Residential addresses include
every address where post is delivered. Each house on a street, each flat in an
apartment block, each unit in a duplex unit and each house in a rural townland
will be given an Eircode.</p>

<p>An Eircode is a unique 7 character code. You can find or check an Eircode
using the <a href="https://finder.eircode.ie/#/">Eircode Finder</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l13aba">Making a complaint</h2>

<h3>An Post's postal services</h3>

<p>To make a complaint about a postal service that An Post provides contact An
Post’s customer service team, outline your complaint and ask for it to be
resolved.</p>

<p>If you are unhappy with the outcome of An Post’s investigation you should
contact the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), which can review
your case and let you know if it can take further action for you.</p>

<h3>Other authorised service providers</h3>

<p>If your complaint relates to a postal service provided by an authorised
service provider other than An Post, you should contact the relevant provider,
outline the complaint and ask for it to be resolved.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.askcomreg.ie/post/register_of_postal_service_providers.61.LE.asp">Contact
details for authorised service providers</a> are available on ComReg’s
website.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, ComReg may be able to help if you are unhappy with the
outcome of the provider’s investigation. Comreg provides <a shape="rect" href="http://www.comreg.ie/industry/postal-regulation/faqs/make-a-postal-complaint/">further
information on postal services and how to make a complaint</a> on its
website.</p>

<h3>Compensation</h3>

<p>If your complaint concerns a monetary claim and relates to one of the other
postal services provided either by an authorised service provider or An Post,
you may also take action through the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/small_claims_court.html">Small Claims
Court</a>.</p>

<p>Whether you can claim compensation depends on the product, service and
postal service provider used. You should first check the terms and conditions
of the product or service to see if you are entitled to compensation.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>Since 12 July 2010 premium rate telephone services in Ireland are regulated
by <a shape="rect" href="http://www.comreg.ie/">ComReg (Commission for
Communications Regulation)</a>. It was previously regulated by RegTel. Comreg
operates through a strict <a shape="rect" href="http://www.comreg.ie/_fileupload/publications/ComReg1054.pdf">Code of
Practice</a>, which all <a href="http://www.comreg.ie/licensing_and_services/prs_provider_definition.716.1044.html">service
providers</a> in Ireland must comply with. </p>

<p>ComReg is also required to assure consumer protection when using national or
international premium rate services and to also set in place procedures to deal
with consumer complaints that arise from using these services. </p>

<h3>What are premium rate telephone services?</h3>

<p>Premium rate telephone services are services provided by companies or
individuals on premium rate telephone numbers. The range of services on offer
include general information such as Weather Forecasting, Traffic News, Stock
Exchange Reports and Sport Results, as well as Advice and Entertainment
services.</p>

<p>These services are sometimes referred to as Information Services and can be
recognised by their unique range of prefixes: 15xx. The 1598 prefix is
dedicated solely to "adult" services. </p>

<p>There are also Premium Rate SMS Services (known as PSMS) and these are
recognised by a 5 digit Short Code beginning with the number 5, for example, a
service providing ringtones. Services of a sexual nature use a 5 digit Short
Code beginning with the numbers 57. </p>

<p>Premium rate services are accessed either through fixed-line telephones,
mobile phones, the Internet or through auto-diallers on personal computers. The
services are advertised in print media and on television, radio and the
Internet. </p>

<p>Calls to premium rate services cost more than ordinary telephone calls and
each prefix has a specific call cost. Call charges from mobile phones are
generally higher and the surcharge varies according to the mobile network
operator. Premium rate call charges are billed to consumers' telephone accounts
and are generally listed separately. The overall charge to the consumer is
shared between the network operator, the service provider or anyone else who
contributes to the provision of the service. </p>

<h3>Call barring</h3>

<p>If you would like to have all premium rate services barred from your
telephone, you should contact your telephone service provider. Some telephone
service providers provide this service free of charge.</p>

<h3>Unsubscribing from a text service</h3>

<p>If you want to unsubscribe from a Premium Rate SMS Service use the reply
button on your mobile to the last message you received and send the word stop.
If you do not have a 5 digit number to send it to, ask your mobile telephone
network operator for the number attached to the last message you received. You
should be unsubscribed within 48 hours of sending the stop command.</p>

<p>ComReg has more <a shape="rect" href="http://www.comreg.ie/premium-rate/advice/solutions-to-common-problems/">information
on unsubscibing from a text service</a> as well as help in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.phonesmart.ie/">finding the service provider's contact
details</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Personal data</h3>

<p>Service Providers must comply fully with the provisions of the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/data_protection.html">Data
Protection Act, 1988</a>, (and any amendment or replacement legislation) with
regard to the collection, processing, keeping, use and disposal of personal
data. </p>

<p>Services that involve the collection of personal information, such as names,
addresses and telephone numbers (including calling line identification or
caller display information) must make clear to you the reason why this
information is required. If personal information held about you is being put to
different use, you must be notified of this use to give you an opportunity to
prevent this, if you wish. </p>

<h3>Advertising of premium rate telephone services</h3>

<p>The advertisement of premium rate telephone services in Ireland on
television, print media and radio and online must comply with standards to
protect consumers. For example, no premium rate service may be promoted as
being "free". No product or service may be described as "free" if it is
obtainable only by the use of a premium rate service. </p>

<h3>Provision of Services</h3>

<p>Premium rate services must be authorised by ComReg and network operators
must not issue a Premium Rate Number or a SMS Short Code until they receive the
ComReg letter of authorisation. </p>

<p>An age warning must be given wherever a service is not aimed at children.
This applies especially to competitions, all chat/dating services, ringtones
&amp; Logos, games and all subscription services. </p>

<p>Where a particular type of service requires a price warning, the caller, on
spending the specified monetary amount, must be made aware of that spend. </p>

<p>Service providers must provide a live operator consumer helpline to handle
consumer queries and complaints. This helpline must operate during normal
office hours.</p>

<h3>International Audiotex Regulators Network</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.iarn.org/">International Audiotex
Regulators Network (IARN)</a> is a network of of organisations that are
involved in the regulation of, or the setting of standards for, the content and
promotion of premium rate services in their own countries. It maintains a set
of guidelines known as the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.iarn.org/documents/iarn_handbook.pdf">IARN handbook (pdf)</a>
which advises on requirements to assure consumer protection when using national
or international premium rate services.</p>

<h3>Complaints</h3>

<p>If you have a complaint or concern, contact the premium rate service
provider with your complaint. If you are not satisfied with their response you
can submit your complaint to ComReg. Complaints must be made within 9 months of
use of the service, however, exceptions to this rule are entirely at the
discretion of the Regulator. It is also important to note that all complaints
are dealt with in confidence. </p>

<p>You should note that disputes regarding or concerning the call cost of a
premium rate service cannot be dealt with by ComReg. You will need to get in
touch directly with the service provider to make your complaint. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>In July 2015, a new national postcode system known as Eircode was
introduced.</p>

<p>All residential and business addresses have been given a unique new Eircode.
Residential addresses include every address where post is delivered. Each house
on a street, each flat in an apartment block, each unit in a duplex unit and
each house in a rural townland has been given an Eircode.</p>

<p>In a halting site with numbered bays, each bay has been given an Eircode.
The Eircode does not belong to the caravan but to the bay in which it resides.
If a caravan or mobile home within a bay moves from the bay, the bay retains
the Eircode. If a halting site has an office that receives mail, the office
address will get an Eircode.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lba536">7-character code</h2>

<p>An Eircode is a unique 7-character code consisting of letters and numbers.
Each Eircode consists of a 3-character <em>routing key</em> to identify the
area and a 4-character <em>unique identifier</em> for each address, for
example, A65 F4E2.</p>

<p>The <em>routing key</em> is the first 3 characters of an Eircode. The first
character is always a letter, followed by 2 numbers (except for D6W). The
letters are not linked to a county or city name, except for postal districts in
Dublin, which have had their existing postal codes transferred into a
<em>routing key</em> format such as D03, D12 and D22. The same <em>routing
key</em> can be shared by several towns and townlands.</p>

<p>The <em>unique identifier</em> is a group of 4-characters and comes after
the <em>routing key</em>. Each <em>unique identifier</em> is different and
unique to your home or premises. They are not in sequence. This is to avoid the
situation where a new building is created between two existing ones, and the
code sequence would be broken, requiring all Eircodes in the area to be
changed.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="la7974">How to use your Eircode</h2>

<p>The Eircode should be placed at the end of your normal address, just below
the County.</p>

<p>If you are writing to a person in Ireland from overseas, the Eircode should
go between the County and Country details.</p>

<p>The use of Eircode is not mandatory. However, it is likely that
organisations will ask you for your Eircode, especially those delivering goods
or services to your address.</p>

<p>You should only give your Eircode to people or companies that you would be
happy to give your address to.</p>

<p><strong>Personal data</strong></p>

<p>There is no personal data on the Eircode database or Eircode Finder. It does
include business names, which in some cases can be the name of an individual,
particularly for small businesses or sole traders.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You do not apply for an Eircode. The information shown on the Eircode Finder
is based on information received from An Post GeoDirectory. As An Post update
their information and it is passed to Eircode, any changes will be reflected on
the Eircode Finder.</p>

<p>Each quarter, Eircode will receive an update with any <strong>new
properties</strong>. At this time any new address will be assigned an Eircode
and an Eircode letter will be sent to the occupier of that address. It is
likely that if your address is not listed on the current Eircode Finder that it
will be in one of the future versions of the Eircode Finder.</p>

<p>Eircode cannot change the postal address information available on the
Eircode Finder unless instructed to do so by An Post GeoDirectory. If your
address in the Eircode Finder is incorrect, it is recommended that you carry on
using the address you normally use and simply add the Eircode.</p>

<p>You can find or check an Eircode using the <a href="https://finder.eircode.ie/#/">Eircode Finder</a>.</p>

<p><em>Cold calling</em> means that you receive unwanted sales calls in your
home from companies that you have not had any dealings with until that time.
You can now register your preference not to receive such cold calls using the
National Directory Database. You may still receive calls where your views are
being sought in connection with market surveys. </p>

<p>The National Directory Database is a list of all telephone numbers contained
in public phone books or available through directory enquiries.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Your preference not to receive cold calls is recorded on the National
Directory Database by the company who receives a line rental payment from you.
This should be done within 5 working days of you notifying them of this
preference. It can subsequently take up to 28 days for this information to
filter through to marketing companies who make ‘cold calls’. This register
only applies to calls that are made in Ireland.</p>

<h3>If companies persist in cold calling you</h3>

<p>If a company makes a cold call to your home and you have registered your
preference not to be called more than 28 days before you should, in the first
instance, let the company know that you do not wish to receive cold calls. You
can also complain to the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dataprotection.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=279">Data Protection
Commissioner</a>. </p>

<p>If you are or have recently been a customer of the company who is calling
you or you have indicated that you wish to get these calls these rules do not
apply. A reputable company should, however, respect your wishes not to be
called.</p>

<h3>Ex-Directory Numbers</h3>

<p>Since October 2006 ex-directory numbers can also be included in the register
of those who do not wish to receive cold calls. If your number is ex-directory
you do not have to register your preference not to have companies call you as
it is done automatically. If you have an ex-directory number and do not want to
be included in the register contact your operator to whom you pay your line
rental and ask not to be included.</p>

<h3>Mobile phones</h3>

<p>Mobile telephone network operators have barred all direct marketing
companies from making cold calls to mobile phone numbers. If you want to allow
direct marketers to contact you in this way, you can call your mobile service
provider and ask that your number be made available to direct marketers.</p>

<p>There is no charge for registering your preference not to have marketing
calls on the National Directory Database. </p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>Contact the company to whom you pay a line rental charge and let them know
that you do not wish to receive unsolicited marketing calls from companies .
They will then insure that your preference not to receive cold calls is
recorded on the National Directory Database. </p>

about <a shape="rect" href="http://www.comreg.ie/consumer-services/mobile-phone/unsolicited-contacts-national-directory-database-2/">dealing

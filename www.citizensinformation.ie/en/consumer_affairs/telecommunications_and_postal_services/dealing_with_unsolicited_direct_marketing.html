<p>Many people do not object to receiving unsolicited mail of an advertising or
promotional nature through the post. In fact, you may find when you are
registering or applying for some services in Ireland that you are asked would
you like to receive promotional mail regarding products or services. For some
people however, such mail is "junk mail"; a nuisance that they wish to avoid.
The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1988/en/act/pub/0025/index.html">Data
Protection Act, 1988</a> contains a special provision to ensure people who do
not wish to receive direct marketing literature - either through the post, over
the phone or over the internet - should have their privacy respected. Mail
addressed to "the householder", "occupant" or similar is not covered by the
Act, however, as it is unlikely to be using personal data. </p>

<h3>Mailing Preference Service</h3>

<p>The Irish Direct Marketing Association (<acronym title="The Irish Direct Marketing Association ">IDMA</acronym>), the
representative body for direct marketers in Ireland, operates a "Mailing
Preference Service". Contact the <acronym title="The Irish Direct Marketing Association ">IDMA</acronym> to ask for your
details to be removed from the marketing databases of the main direct marketers
in Ireland and you should receive fewer unwanted mailings. You can fill in the
<a shape="rect" href="http://idma.ie/index.php?id=26">Mail Preference Service
application form</a> online or download it from their website.</p>

<p>The <acronym title="The Irish Direct Marketing Association ">IDMA</acronym>
has also instituted a Code of Practice on Data Protection, setting out the data
protection rules that <acronym title="The Irish Direct Marketing Association ">IDMA</acronym> members must
adhere to.</p>

<h3>The right to have your name removed from a direct marketing database</h3>

<p>Under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1988/en/act/pub/0025/sec0002.html#zza25y1988s2">section
2(7) of the Data Protection Act</a>, you have the right to have your details
removed from a direct marketing database. To do this, you should write to the
organisation keeping the database and ask it to remove your details. The
organisation must comply with your request and write back to you within 40
days, confirming that your request has been complied with. </p>

<p>If the direct marketing organisation keeps your details for direct marketing
purposes, and also for some other purpose, then it must stop using the details
for direct marketing. However, in this case, the organisation may continue to
keep and use your details for other purpose, provided of course that there is
no breach of data protection law involved. The organisation must inform you
about the other purposes it is keeping your details for. </p>

<p>There are a number of telephone networks in Ireland. Each mobile telephone
network is operated by a different provider. In order for a mobile telephone
service provider to gain access to the market, they must be licensed by the
Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).</p>

<p>Each of the mobile telephone service providers offers different packages to
consumers. ComReg's website allows consumers to <a href="http://www.comreg.ie/price-comparison/mobile-phone/calculator/">compare
mobile phone charges</a> across all operators. The site assists consumers to
select the optimum mobile phone package, based on their individual usage. </p>

<p>If you buy a mobile phone you have a contract with the mobile phone service
provider. The type of contract depends on whether you choose a Pre-pay or
Post-pay mobile telephone service: </p>
<ul><li>Pre-pay services means that you pay as you go and you buy credit on your
    phone from various outlets such as shops, bank machines and over the phone.
  </li>
  <li>Post-pay service means that you receive a bill for all the calls that you
    make. </li>
</ul><p>Within these 2 different types of contract there are also many variations.
When choosing a mobile phone package, ask yourself: </p>
<ul><li>When do you expect to make most of your calls (at peak or off peak times)
  </li>
  <li>Will you use SMS (short messaging service or text messaging) more than
    voice calls </li>
  <li>Which service providers are being used by the people whom you are likely
    to be calling </li>
</ul><h3>Peak and off-peak rates</h3>

<p>Peak times are normally during the day when most people and businesses are
making calls. Generally calls cost more during <em>peak</em> times. <em>Off
peak</em> rates are normally in the evenings, night and at weekends. Calls can
cost less during these periods. Make sure you know the times and rates for
<em>peak</em> and <em>off peak</em> as these may change with different mobile
phone call packages. </p>

<h3>Changing your mobile telephone service provider</h3>

<p>It is possible to change from one service provider to another service
provider and retain your existing mobile telephone number. However, before
changing to a new service provider you should first check what contractual
obligations you have to your existing service provider. <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/number-portability">Under
EU rules</a> provision has been made to ensure that a consumer can move their
number from one service provider to another within one working day. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Remember that the mobile phone handset that you buy is protected under the
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1980/en/act/pub/0016/index.html">Sale of
Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980</a>. This means that any mobile
telephone handset or other telecommunications item you buy should be </p>
<ul><li>As described - on the marketing material or by the sales person </li>
  <li>Fit for its purpose (that is, suitable for using as a mobile telephone
    handset) </li>
  <li>Of merchantable quality (that is, fit to be sold and used by a customer)
  </li>
</ul><p>If the handset or other piece of mobile equipment that you buy from a mobile
phone service provider or other retailer becomes faulty you can return it and
you can get a repair replacement or a refund. The legislation does not specify
what kind of redress the retailer has to give you but you should expect that it
will be reasonable. You can read about <a shape="rect" href="../consumer_protection/consumer_complaints/how_to_make_a_consumer_complaint.html">how
to complain</a>. If you have exhausted the complaints mechanism of the mobile
phone service provider and you are still dissatisfied you can take your claim
to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/small_claims_court.html">Small Claims
Court</a>.</p>

<h3>4G services</h3>

<p>4G is a term for <em>fourth generation mobile telephone technology</em> and
follows on from 2G and 3G. 2G technology was suitable for making calls and
sending text messages while 3G makes it possible to access the internet more
effectively through your mobile phone. 4G services should make it much quicker
to surf the web on your mobile phone.</p>

<h3>Mobile phone insurance</h3>

<p>Mobile phone insurance like other types of insurance can insure the handset
against loss, theft, etc. Many mobile insurance policies offer to protect your
mobile in specific situations, such as accidental damage, from theft, loss,
water damage, accidental damage and more. Often when you purchase a mobile
telephone, you may be asked whether you require mobile phone insurance. Check
the initial amount that you need to pay before the insurance company will pay
for any loss or damage to insured items. This initial amount you must pay is
called the excess. If you have home and contents insurance for your home the
theft of your mobile phone may be covered by that insurance – you can check
this with your insurance company. </p>

<h3>Mobile phone roaming</h3>

<p>If your service provider allows you to use your mobile phone when you travel
you can be charged roaming rates. Roaming is the ability to use your mobile
phone while abroad. You should be aware that the charges for using your phone
when roaming are different to the rates charged when making calls at home.</p>

<p>There is a cap on the price you can be charged for using your mobile phone
while travelling in the EU. The cap on price only applies when roaming within
the EU. It is advisable to contact your service provider in advance of
travelling abroad to see what charges will apply if you use your phone in
another country. </p>

<p>You can read more <a shape="rect" href="http://www.comreg.ie/consumer-services/mobile-phone/roaming-2/">information
about mobile phone roaming</a> on ComReg's website<a shape="rect" href="http://www.askcomreg.ie/default.asp"></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Roaming charges from 30 April 2016</strong></p>

<p>There is an EU agreement to abolish roaming charges from 15 June 2017. A
transitional period will be in force from 30 April 2016 to 15 June 2017. During
this <a href="http://www.askcomreg.ie/news/reduced_roaming_rates_from_1_july_2013.7.1082.LE.asp">transitional
period</a>, mobile operators may charge their customers an extra fee (a
surcharge) for roaming on top of their domestic price. However, these
surcharges are capped.</p>

<p><strong>Roaming charges abolished from 15 June 2017</strong></p>

<p>There is an EU agreement to abolish roaming charges from 15 June 2017. This
means from 15 June 2017, you will be charged the same price for using your
mobile phone when travelling in the EU as you are charged in your home
country.</p>

<h4>Mobile phone internet roaming bills</h4>

<p>Mobile phone operators must provide their customers with a cut-off spending
limit of €50 (excluding VAT) a month on their internet surfing bill when
roaming within the EU, although a customer can opt for a higher limit. When 80%
of the cash limit has been reached, the operator has to warn you that you are
approaching the limit and will be cut off, unless that limit is changed. Since
1 July 2012, these measures also apply when roaming outside the EU. </p>

<p>Since 1 July 2014, you will be able to use a separate roaming services
provider while continuing to use the same handset and phone number. </p>

<p>More information is available on the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/roaming">EU Commission's
website</a>.</p>

<h3>If your phone is stolen</h3>

<p>Every handset sold has a unique number called an IMEI (International Mobile
Equipment Identification) number. Record this information and register it with
your mobile phone service provider when you buy the handset. If your phone is
stolen report the theft immediately to the Gardaí and your mobile phone
service provider who can then ensure that the phone is made unusable on all
networks. Contact your mobile phone service provider for further information on
this scheme. </p>

<h3>Children and mobile phones</h3>

<p>Many children in Ireland and abroad use mobile phones. Modern mobile phones
are means by which the internet can be accessed and can be used to transmit
video and other images which may or may not be appropriate for children. The
Irish Cellular Industry Association has published <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hotline.ie/library/knowledge.pdf">A parent's guide to mobile
phones (pdf)</a> which explains good practice with regard to mobile phone use
for children. The Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland in
association with the <a href="http://www.internetsafety.ie/website/ois/oisweb.nsf/page/index-en">Office
for Internet Safety</a> operates a website <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hotline.ie/">www.hotline.ie</a> where you can report instances
of child pornography that you may come across.</p>

<h3>Making a complaint</h3>

<p>If you have an issue with your mobile phone service provider, you should
contact your provider, outline your complaint and ask for it to be resolved. If
you are not satisfied with the outcome you should contact ComReg who may be
able to help resolve the issue. Information on <a shape="rect" href="http://www.comreg.ie/queries-complaints/mobile/">making a complaint to
ComReg</a> is available on its consumer website.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Different service providers charge different rates for mobile service
packages – it is up to you to research the different rates and to see where
you can get best value for money for the services that you use.</p>

<p>If you have a problem with your mobile phone handset and you fail to get
satisfaction from the retailer where you bought your mobile phone you can go to
the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/small_claims_court.html">Small
Claims Court</a>.<br></p>

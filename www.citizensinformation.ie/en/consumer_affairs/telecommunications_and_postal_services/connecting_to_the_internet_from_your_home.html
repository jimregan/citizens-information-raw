<p>There are many different options for accessing the internet from your
home.</p>

<p>Common methods of Internet access by users include:</p>
<ul><li>Dial-up with a computer modem via a telephone line</li>
  <li>Broadband over designated cables</li>
  <li>Wireless connections using Wi-Fi, satellite and mobile phone
  technology.</li>
</ul><p>The option you choose can depend on cost, connection speed, quality of
connection and whether a service is available in your area.</p>

<p>The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) provides i<a href="http://www.comreg.ie/consumer-services/internet/">nformation on internet
services on Comreg's website</a>. </p>

<h3>Internet service providers</h3>

<p>Internet service providers are regulated by Commission for Communications
Regulation (ComReg). You can find a <a href="https://serviceregister.comreg.ie/">internet service providers authorised
to operate in Ireland on ComRegs website</a>. Some internet service providers
can also provide phone and television services. You can subscribe to a
different service provider for internet and telephone purposes if you wish.
Shop around for the best package that meets your needs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.comreg.ie/price-comparison/broadband/calculator/">ComRegâ€™s
independent price guide</a> will allow you to compare the costs of home phone,
broadband, mobile phone and <a href="http://www.comreg.ie/price-comparison/combined/calculator/">combined
packages</a> for your specific usage needs.</p>

<h3>Broadband</h3>

<p>Broadband is a term for high speed internet access. Broadband allows users
to access bigger amounts of data such as large video files. The benefit of
broadband is its speed and that it is always on.</p>

<p>There are a number of broadband technologies that enable you to access the
internet quickly. Digital subscriber line (DSL), fibre-optic, cable, mobile and
satellite are all technologies that provide high speed access to the
internet.</p>

<p>There are many different providers of Broadband and each will have a
different package for the provision of services. Most offer a flat rate which
means that you will be charged the same for provision of services every month.
There may be a limit on the amount you can download. Make sure that you are
happy with these limits when you subscribe to the service.</p>

<p>Broadband speed is measured in Mb (megabits) per second. Download refers to
the speed with which you can receive content from the Internet. Upload refers
to the speed with which you can send content.</p>

<p>Most people download much more than they upload, therefore Broadband
download speeds are always set to be faster than upload speeds.</p>

<p>More information on <a shape="rect" href="http://www.comreg.ie/consumer-services/internet/">Broadband internet
access</a> and <a shape="rect" href="http://www.callcosts.ie/broadband/Broadband_Calculator.175.LE.asp">Broadband
providers</a> is available from ComReg.</p>

<p>June 2015, the government announced the <a href="http://www.broadband.gov.ie/">National Broadband Plan</a>. This is a
State intervention to make broadband available nationally because commercial
operators have made it clear that there are large parts of the country that
they cannot make high speed broadband services available commercially.</p>

<h3>Internet safety</h3>

<p>While the internet can be a source of knowledge and entertainment for
children, there also can be dangers for children. The Office for Internet
Safety (OIS) was established in March 2008 within the Department of Justice and
Equality to promote internet safety. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.internetsafety.ie/website/ois/oisweb.nsf/page/safety-en">Information
and advice on internet safety</a> is available on its website <a shape="rect" href="http://www.internetsafety.ie/">internetsafety.ie</a></p>

<p>Information on the safe use of the internet is available at <a href="http://www.makeitsecure.org/en/index.html#">makeitsecure.org</a>.</p>

<p>A service called <a shape="rect" href="https://www.hotline.ie/">hotline.ie</a>, which is run by the Internet
Service Providers Association of Ireland (ISPAI), was setup to provide an
anonymous reporting service for members of the public who want to report
suspected illegal content which they have encountered on the Internet.
Hotline.ie's primary aim is to combat child pornography, however, other forms
of illegal content and activities on the Internet may be reported using this
service. Their website also provides <a shape="rect" href="https://www.hotline.ie/internet-safety/safety-tips/">safety advice for
parents and children on using the internet</a>.</p>

<h3>Making a complaint</h3>

<p>If you are unhappy with any aspect of your internet service you should, in
the first instance make this known to the service provider. This document tells
you <a shape="rect" href="../consumer_protection/consumer_complaints/how_to_make_a_consumer_complaint.html">how
to complain</a>. If you have exhausted the customer complaints mechanism of the
service provider and are still dissatisfied you can contact ComReg who may,

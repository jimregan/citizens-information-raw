<p>Recent developments in communications technology have produced an
environment in which information can move between people and organisations more
rapidly than ever before. However, one drawback is that sometimes we receive
information we do not want. This document explains the law in Ireland and the
EU regarding your rights when dealing with unsolicited or offensive e-mails.
</p>

<p>One of the most common problems affecting people with e-mail accounts is
unsolicited commercial e-mail (UCE). Unsolicited commercial e-mails are e-mails
that have not been requested from a company of which the receiver is not a
customer. These e-mails are also called SPAM. These mails can sometimes be
adult in nature. Receiving adult UCE is annoying and, in some cases, upsetting.
Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/si/0336.html">SI 336 of
2011</a> [European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and
Services) (Privacy and Electronic Communications) Regulations 2011] the sending
of unsolicited commercial emails can be an offence. and an offender can be <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/criminal_law/criminal_trial/criminal_trial.html">tried summarily
or on indictment</a>.</p>

<p>Reputable companies should not market their products through unsolicited
commercial mails. It is, therefore, important not to engage with any company
who sends unsolicited commercial e-mails by replying to them or contacting them
through other means. </p>

<h3>Unsolicited mobile telephone text messages</h3>

<p>In September 2005 for the first time, a company in Ireland was prosecuted by
the Data Protection Commissioner for sending unsolicited commercial text
messages to mobile telephone subscribers. These text messages also qualify as
SPAM. <a shape="rect" href="dealing_with_unwanted_telephone_sales_calls.html">Read more about dealing

<h3>What can you do about unsolicited commercial e-mail?</h3>

<p>Unsolicitied commercial e-mail (UCE) can come from various organisations,
companies or be the product of ‘computer viruses’. Companies or individuals
can get your e-mail address from the web. Other sources exist such as marketing
lists that you sign up to and are passed between companies. Unsolicited
commercial e-mails generally also come from outside Ireland and outside the
European Union. This means that it is quite difficult to stop the occurrence of
UCE as it is a global phenomenon. Generally, there is little that you can do to
prevent unsolicited commercial e-mails being sent to you.</p>

<h3>What to do if you receive UCE</h3>

<p>In the vast bulk of cases of UCE, the e-mail headers you see in the unwanted
e-mail are not valid. </p>
<ul><li>E-mail headers may be forged so replying to the e-mail merely results in
    you sending UCE to the innocent person whose e-mail address was forged.
  </li>
  <li>It is not advised to respond to an e-mail address to "opt-out" of a list
    unless the address is from a recognised organisation. These e-mail
    addresses may also be false or are used to confirm that the unwanted e-mail
    was originally sent to a valid and active e-mail account. </li>
  <li>Responding to a web site that supposedly lets you remove yourself from
    the list is also not advised. This is because once you access the web site
    your details are logged. You could also you be exposed to pornography. </li>
</ul><p>It is possible to determine the location (rather than the user or the e-mail
address) from where the e-mail was sent. If you are able to look at the e-mail
headers, you will then be able to determine the IP address of the Internet
Service Provider (ISP) whose services were used to send the e-mail. Finding out
exactly where UCE has come from can be difficult and time consuming.</p>

<p>If you receive a lot of unsolicited commercial or offensive emails you can
subscribe to a software programme that will filter out messages that you may
not want to receive. </p>

<h3>Illegal content</h3>

<p>If you have determined the location of the sender of these e-mails, then it
may be possible to send an e-mail to abuse@isp to complain about the e-mail.
However, adult e-mails are not illegal in many countries including Ireland. If
you do succeed in sending an e-mail complaint to abuse@isp and the material is
illegal in the jurisdiction it originated in or in breach of the Acceptable Use
Policy of the sender's ISP, the ISP can disconnect the sender. However, it
might be unable to tell you the name of the sender due to international data
protection regulations. In many cases, the sender just moves to a different ISP
and starts the process again.</p>

<p>The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998 outlaws child pornography.
Any person found to produce, forward, publish, show or possess child
pornography is committing a crime. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.HOTLINE.ie">www.HOTLINE.ie</a> was established by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ispai.ie/">Internet Service Providers Association
of Ireland</a> to deal with instances of child pornography or other illegal
material that Irish internet users come across either on the internet or in an
e-mail. This website is connected to other similar hotlines in other countries
and so can work across borders.</p>

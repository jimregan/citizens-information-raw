<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) is an independent statutory body
established under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2009/a1809.pdf">Broadcasting
Act 2009.</a> It regulates both commercial and public service broadcasting.</p>

<p>Members of the BAI are nominated by Government and hold office for a period
of five years.</p>

<p>If you have a complaint about material broadcast in Ireland you can contact
the broadcaster. If you are not satisfied with the response from the
broadcaster you can make a complaint to the BAI.</p>

<p>The broadcast material you can complain about includes radio and television
programmes, and advertisements broadcast by all public, commercial and
community radio and television broadcasters in the State.</p>

<p>For example, you can complain to the BAI about broadcast material where the
broadcaster has not met the requirements to ensure:</p>
<ul><li>Impartiality in news and fairness in current affairs</li>
  <li>The material does not cause harm or offence</li>
  <li>Law and order</li>
  <li>Privacy of an individual</li>
  <li>Codes of standards and practice in relation to advertising, teleshopping,
    sponsorship and commercial promotion,</li>
</ul><p>You cannot complain to the BAI about broadcasts received in this State but
licensed in another jurisdiction such as the United Kingdom.</p>

<h3>Impartiality and fairness</h3>

<p>Broadcasters must ensure that the news they broadcast is reported and
presented in an objective and impartial manner - they must present the news
without expressing their own views. Two or more related broadcasts may be
considered as a whole if they are transmitted within a reasonable period of
time. There is a <a href="http://www.bai.ie/index.php/code-of-fairness-objectivity-and-impartiality-in-news-and-current-affairs/">Code
of Fairness, Objectivity and Impartiality in News and Current Affairs</a> that
outlines the principles and rules that broadcasters must follow. </p>

<h3>Harm or offence</h3>

<p>Every broadcaster must ensure that it does not broadcast anything that may
reasonably be regarded as causing harm or undue offence. In this regard, there
is a <a href="http://www.bai.ie/index.php/code-of-programme-standards/">Code of
Programme Standards</a> that has principles and rules that broadcasters must
follow. This Code details a range of factors that may be taken into account
when determining whether undue offence or harm may be caused by programme
material.</p>

<h3>Law and order</h3>

<p>Every broadcaster must ensure that it does not broadcast anything that can
be reasonably be regarded as likely to promote or incite crime or as tending to
undermine the authority of the State. </p>

<h3>Privacy of an individual</h3>

<p>It is the duty of the broadcaster to ensure that the privacy of an
individual is not unreasonably invaded in programmes broadcast by it and in the
means employed to make such programmes. </p>

<h3>Advertising, teleshopping, sponsorship and commercial promotion codes</h3>

<p>Broadcasters must work within two established codes of standards and
practice for commercial communications. These are the <a href="http://www.bai.ie/index.php/revised-general-and-childrens-communications-codes-june2013/">General
Commercial Communications Code</a> and the <a href="http://www.bai.ie/index.php/revised-general-and-childrens-communications-codes-june2013/">Children’s
Commercial Communications Code</a>.</p>

<p>Types of commercial communications include advertising, sponsorship,
teleshopping and product placement but do not include public service
announcements and charity appeals broadcast free of charge. A full definition
of what constitutes a commercial communication is included in the General
Commercial Communications Code.<br></p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l13aba">Making a complaint</h2>

<p>If you have a complaint about material broadcast in Ireland you must make
your complaint to the broadcaster first. You should make your complaint in
writing. How to make your complaint is outlined in the broadcaster’s Code of
Practice for Complaints Handling. This can be found in the complaints section
of a broadcasters’ website.</p>

<p>If you are not satisfied with the response from the broadcaster you can make
a complaint to the BAI.</p>

<h3>Making your complaint to the broadcaster</h3>

<p>Your complaint must be in writing and made within 30 days of the broadcast.
If your complaint relates to two or more unrelated broadcasts, it must be sent
within 30 days of the date of the earlier or earliest broadcast. If your
complaint relates to two or more related broadcasts, of which at least two are
made on different dates, it must be sent within 30 days of the date of the
later or latest of these broadcasts.</p>

<p>Your complaint must also:</p>
<ul><li>Include the date and time of the broadcast and the channel it was
    broadcast on</li>
  <li>Come within the relevant broadcasting codes and/or legislation</li>
  <li>Include a short detailed summary of what might have caused offence. </li>
</ul><h3>Making a complaint to BAI</h3>

<p>If you have made a complaint to the broadcaster and you are not satisfied
with their response you can escalate your complaint to the BAI.</p>

<p>Your complaint must relate to a broadcast by an Irish broadcasting service.
You must make your complaint within 14 days of the broadcaster’s decision or
the broadcasters timeframe to issue you with a response if they haven’t done
so. The BAI has the discretion to accept complaints received later than 14
days.</p>

<p>If you have a complaint about material broadcast in Ireland you must make
your complaint to the broadcaster first. However, you may make your complaint
directly to BAI if the complaint deals with issues of privacy, anonymity or the
complainant provides an acceptable reason why the complaint should not be
referred to the relevant broadcaster first.</p>

<p>The BAI will consider the programme material complained of in whole and in
context with reference to:</p>
<ul><li>The matters identified in the complaint</li>
  <li>The relevant Code</li>
  <li>The provisions of the Broadcasting Act 2009</li>
  <li>The provisions of the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/LSU/?uri=CELEX:32010L0013&amp;qid=1426782714365">Audiovisual
    Media Services Directive 2010/13/EU</a></li>
  <li>The procedures, practices and policies of the BAI.</li>
</ul><p>The BAI will decide whether or not the broadcaster has respected the
relevant codes and legislation.</p>

<p>All decisions of the BAI are made available to the public. <strong>Unless
the BAI considers it inappropriate to do so</strong>, summaries of all
complaints are distributed to the media and featured on its website. The name
of the complainant is included in the published information. You can access <a href="http://www.bai.ie/?page_id=183">decisions made by BAI</a>. </p>

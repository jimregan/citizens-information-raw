<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="leb1f9">Information </h2>

<p>Every household, business or institution in Ireland with a television or
equipment capable of receiving a television signal (using an aerial, satellite
dish, cable or other means) must have a television licence. A television
licence is a certificate that states that you have paid the appropriate fee to
the government and contributed to the cost of public service broadcasting in
Ireland. Your television licence is issued for 1 year in general.</p>

<p>Public service broadcasting in Ireland means comprehensive radio and
television services that are free to transmit programmes that entertain,
educate, inform and cater for all members of the community. These services must
also provide news and current affairs programmes, including coverage of
proceedings in the Houses of the Oireachtas (Irish Parliament) and the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/european_government/eu_institutions/european_parliament.html">European
Parliament</a>. </p>

<p>Each year, the government provides a grant to <a shape="rect" href="http://www.rte.ie/about/">RTE (the national broadcasting
organisation)</a>, which is funded by your television licence fee. RTE has
responsibilities to deliver public service programmes in Ireland. The
television licence fee is collected by An Post on behalf of the Minister for <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/">Department of Communication,
Climate Action and the Environment</a>, who has responsibility for broadcasting
policy in Ireland. </p>

<h3>Digital switchover</h3>

<p>The EU decided that all member states must stop broadcasting analogue
television by the end of 2012. Saorview is the free-to-air digital terrestrial
television (DTT) service which replaced analogue television in Ireland. It is
owned and managed by RTE. Saorsat, a satellite service, provides access to
Irish free-to-air digital television channels and services for those unable to
receive Saorview. The analogue television service in Ireland switched off in
October 2012. More information is available at <a href="http://www.saorview.ie/">saorview.ie</a>.</p>

<p>With the switch off of the analogue television service, your analogue
television set needs a set-top box to receive digital television. Your analogue
television set, with or without a set-top box, still requires a television
licence.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If your household, business or institution possesses a television or
equipment capable of receiving a television signal, you are required by law to
have a television licence. Even if the television or other equipment is broken
and currently unable to receive a signal, it is regarded as capable of being
repaired so it can receive a signal and you must hold a licence for it. Failure
to produce evidence of a television licence to an inspector can result in a
court appearance and on conviction, you can receive a substantial fine. People
who have been fined and who have breached court orders directing them to pay
their television licence can be imprisoned.</p>

<p>You do not require a television licence to watch television on your computer
or mobile phone. However, the computer must not be able to receive a signal
distributed by conventional television broadcasting networks, for example,
cable, satellite or aerial.</p>

<p>When a first-time television licence is issued it remains in force until the
end of the 11th month following the month in which it was issued. For example,
if the licence was issued in the middle of April it will remain in force until
the end of March the following year. When you renew it at the end of that
period, the new licence remains in force for 12 months.</p>

<p>If you are aged over 70, you can get a television licence free of charge as
part of the Household Benefits package. Some people under 70 may also qualify
for the Household Benefits Package and a free television licence. <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/extra_social_welfare_benefits/household_benefits_package.html">To
find out more about the Household Benefits Package click here</a>.</p>

<h3>If I have two television sets in my home do I need licences for them
both?</h3>

<p>If the equipment capable of receiving a television signal (for example a
television set or a personal computer) is held in a household (an apartment,
flat or a house), then one television licence will cover multiple pieces of
equipment. In other words, if you have a television set in your living room and
kitchen, one television licence covers both sets. </p>

<p>However, if the building in which the equipment is kept is sub-divided into
flats or apartments or other separate living quarters, then a separate
television licence must be held for each of these quarters. In other words, an
individual licence must be held for each separate flat, apartment or other
dwelling.</p>

<h3>Rented accommodation</h3>

<p>If you are a tenant living in rented accommodation with a television
<span>you must have </span>a television licence. This applies irrespective of
who owns the television (whether the television belongs to you <span>or</span>
the landlord). The law states that anyone resident on a premises in possession
of a television set must have a television licence. </p>

<h3>Moving to a new home</h3>

<p>If you are moving house, it is possible and highly advisable to have your
television licence transferred to your new address. Simply bring your existing
licence to your nearest Post Office, together with evidence of your new address
(that is a household utility bill or a bank statement). Staff in your Post
Office will then amend the details on your record and your licence will be
updated and re-issued to you. This service is free. </p>

<h3>Television licences for holiday homes/second homes</h3>

<p>If your holiday home/second home contains a television, or equipment capable
of receiving a television signal (using an aerial, satellite dish, cable or
other means), then this household must also have a television licence. This is
the case even if this is not your main residence and you already hold a licence
for your main address. Failure to have a television licence where this is
required can result in penalties. </p>

<h3>Moving to Ireland from another jurisdiction</h3>

<p>It is not possible to transfer a television licence from another
jurisdiction to Ireland. Television licences for Ireland can only be purchased
here and are only valid here. This means that if you transfer residence from
Northern Ireland or another country (either in the EU or outside the EU) you
must still purchase a television licence here. </p>

<p>Even if you will be remaining in Ireland for a short time, you are required
to have a television licence. Each licence is issued for a 1 year period; this
means that if you will be staying in Ireland for less than 1 year, you must
still obtain a full television licence. You cannot obtain a refund on the
licence fee if you will be leaving Ireland before the licence expires. </p>

<h3>Penalties</h3>

<p>Conviction for non-payment of a television licence (first offence) is a fine
of up to €1,000.</p>

<p>If you are convicted a second time or more for not paying your television
licence, you will be fined up to €2,000.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The cost of a television licence is €160.</p>

<p>Amendments (for example, a change of address) to existing television
licences are free of charge. You can <a href="https://www.tvlicence.ie/LogOn.aspx">change the address details
online</a> or at a <a href="http://www.anpost.ie/AnPost/GeneralTemplates/AboutUsStandard.aspx?NRMODE=Published&amp;NRNODEGUID=%7b410EB35F-D5DD-4227-8E4F-A34AF8120B04%7d&amp;NRORIGINALURL=%2fAnPost%2fMainContent%2fPersonal%2bCustomers%2f">TV

institution. </p>

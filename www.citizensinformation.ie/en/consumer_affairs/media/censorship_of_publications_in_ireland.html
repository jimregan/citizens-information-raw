<p>The Censorship of Publications Board is an independent board established by
law to examine books and periodicals for sale in Ireland. The Board may
prohibit the sale and distribution of books and periodicals if they are found
to be obscene. A prohibition on the sale and distribution of a particular
publication means that it is illegal for this book to be bought, sold or
distributed around the country. Books that are prohibited may be appealed to
the Censorship of Publications Appeal Board. Both the Censorship of
Publications Board and the Appeals Board consist of five members each. Members
of both boards are appointed by the Minister for Justice and Equality. Posts on
these boards are without remuneration (i.e., they are unpaid). </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The Censorship of Publications Board will examine any book or periodical
referred to it by a Customs and Excise officer and any book referred to it by a
member of the public. It may also examine any book or periodical on its own
initiative. In Ireland, there is no category of restricted access - a
publication is either prohibited or it is not prohibited. The Board does not
prohibit publications very often, and in some years, nothing is prohibited.</p>

<p>The Board has regular meetings to discuss publications referred to it. Every
member of the Board will have read the publication before the meeting. For a
book to be prohibited, at least three members must agree with the decision and
only one can dissent (i.e., disagree). If the prohibition is passed, it comes
into effect as soon as it is announced in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irisoifigiuil.ie/">Iris Oifigúil</a> (Ireland's official
State gazette). A prohibition order on a book ceases on the 31 December
following a period of 12 years beginning on the date of the order coming into
effect. A first prohibition order on a periodical is for 3, 6 or 12 months,
depending on how often it is published. A second or subsequent prohibition
order on a periodical is permanent. It is possible to appeal against the order.
 </p>

<h3>Appealing against a prohibition order</h3>

<p>The Censorship of Publications Appeal Board operates in a similar fashion to
the Censorship of Publications Board, except that its members only need a
simple majority for a decision. </p>

<p>An appeal against the prohibition of a book may be made by the author,
editor or publisher of the book or by any five members of the Oireachtas (the
<a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/the_seanad.html">Seanad</a>
or the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/dail_eireann.html">Dáil</a>)
who are acting jointly. The Appeal Board may affirm the order, revoke the order
or vary the order so as to exclude a particular edition of the book from the
order. </p>

<p>An appeal against the prohibition of a periodical may be made by the
publisher of the periodical or by any five members of the Oireachtas acting
jointly. The Appeal Board may revoke the order or may vary the order to allow
for the sale and distribution of a particular issue or edition of the
periodical. </p>

<h3>Grounds for banning a books or periodicals in Ireland</h3>

<p>Books are prohibited if the Censorship of Publications Board considers them
to be indecent or obscene. Periodicals are prohibited if the Censorship of
Publications Board considers them to be frequently or usually indecent or
obscene. Both books and periodicals may be prohibited if the Board considers
that they advocate <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/women_s_health/abortion_information_the_law.html">abortion</a> or
ways of carrying out abortions. Periodicals may also be prohibited if the Board
is of the opinion that they have given an unduly large proportion of space to
matters relating to crime. In practice, however, publications are usually only
reported to the Board for obscenity. The Board will measure the literary,
scientific or historical merit of the publication. It will take note of its
general tenor, the language in which it is written, its likely circulation and
readers and anything else it feels is relevant. It may take into account any
communication with the author, editor or publisher. </p>

<p>If a publication has been examined by the Censorship of Publications Board
and a prohibition order is not at present in force against it, then the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0022/index.html">Child
Trafficking and Pornography Act</a> 1998 does not apply to it. </p>

<p>The Gardai may be issued with a search warrant if they suspect that
prohibited books or periodicals are being kept anywhere for sale or
distribution. </p>

<p>The Register of Prohibited Publications keeps a record of the publications
that are currently prohibited and any variations on prohibition orders. You can
consult the Register for free in the Censorship of Publications Office and the
Register is occasionally published. </p>

<p>The Boards are both independent authorities and the Minister for Justice and
Equality has no power over their decisions. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2004/A1704.pdf">Child
Trafficking and Pornography (Amendment) Act 2004</a> has two purposes in
relation to censorship of publications. It ensures that any person who sends or
produces documents to a committee of the houses of the Oireachtas (which might
include child pornography) <span>does not run the risk</span> of committing the
criminal offence of distributing child pornography. This is necessary where
someone is obliged to comply with a direction from a Dail or Seanad committee
to either send or produce to the committee any specified documents in their
possession. </p>

<p>Second, the 1998 Child Trafficking and Pornography Act also makes it an
offence to possess, print, publish or show child pornography. However, it
provides no exemption to members of the Oireachtas who might come into
possession etc of child pornography as a consequence of carrying out their
proper functions. The 2004 Act ensures that any member of the Oireachtas, civil
servant or adviser who came into possession of child pornography, or
distributed, printed, published or showed child pornography, while carrying out
their <span>legitimate functions</span> in gathering evidence during an
investigation into any matter relating to child pornography, or assisting in
any such investigation, would not commit a criminal offence.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>There is a fee of €6.35 to be paid by an author or publisher lodging an
appeal against a prohibition order. This will be returned if the appeal is
considered to be a serious appeal. In practice, every appeal fee is returned.

copies as requested of a periodical, and the fee, as mentioned above. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Electricity is generated in Ireland from a number of sources such as gas,
coal, oil and renewable souces. </p>

<p>The standard electricity voltage in Ireland is 230V a.c., nominal, at 50Hz,
with plugs being of the 3 pin IS411 (BS 1363) type. If you are moving to
Ireland or coming to Ireland on holiday, you should check any electrical
appliances you wish to bring with you in advance to ensure that you can use
them in Ireland.</p>

<p>The <a href="commission_for_energy_regulation.html">Commission for Energy
Regulation (CER)</a> regulates the electricity market and can deal with
unresolved complaints. </p>

<p>Electricity services in Ireland are provided by the Electricity Supply Board
(ESB), a state body that is owned and controlled by the Government. ESB owns
and manages the electricity network and operates 19 major power stations
throughout Ireland and a number of smaller stations in 28 sites around the
country. </p>

<h3>Deregulation of the electricity market in Ireland</h3>

<p>In February 2000, as a result of EU directive 96/92/EC, the electricity
market in Ireland was opened to competition. Larger customers using 4 gigawatt
hours or more of power per year became free to choose their own electricity
supplier. The retail electricity market opened fully to competition in February
2005.</p>

<p>In November 2007 a Single Electricity Market (SEM) came into effect with the
trading of wholesale electricity in Ireland and Northern Ireland on an
all-island basis.</p>

<p>All business markets were deregulated from October 2010. From April 2011,
the domestic market is deregulated with all suppliers free to set their own
tariffs. </p>

<h3>Transmission and distribution of electricity</h3>

<p>The <em>electricity transmission system</em>, commonly known as the national
grid, is a high voltage network for the transmission of bulk electricity
supplies from the electricity generation sources to transformer stations around
Ireland. EirGrid, an independent state-owned body, is the <em>transmission
system operator</em> and is responsible for the operation, development and
maintenance of the system. ESB Networks, a separate business unit within ESB,
is the owner of the transmission system and is responsible for carrying out the
maintenance and construction of the system. </p>

<p>The <em>distribution network</em> is the medium and low voltage electricity
network used to deliver electricity from the transformer stations to connection
points such as houses, offices, shops, and street lights, and is owned by ESB
Networks. ESB Networks is also the <em>distribution system operator </em>and is
responsible for building, maintaining and operating all the distibution level
network infrastructure. This includes all overhead electricity lines, poles and
underground cables. ESB Networks has responsibility to all electricity
customers, <span>irrespective of their supplier</span>, for: </p>
<ul><li>Connection to the network </li>
  <li>Reading meters and passing these readings to the different supply
    companies </li>
  <li>Restoring supply in cases of interruptions and emergencies </li>
</ul><h3>Electricity supply</h3>

<p>There are a number of <a shape="rect" href="http://www.cer.ie//customer-care/about-us/links#Electricity-Suppliers">electricity
suppliers licenced by CER to supply electricity to retail customers</a>. </p>

<p>ESB Electic Ireland (formerly called ESB Customer Supply), an independent
business unit within ESB, operates as the <em>Public Electricity Supplier</em>.
Under this licence, ESB Electric Ireland is required among other things:</p>
<ul><li>To supply all customers who are not served by another supplier </li>
  <li>Not to discriminate in relation to supplying electricity </li>
  <li>To purchase electricity in the most economic way </li>
  <li>To achieve certain performance targets set by CER </li>
</ul><h3>Services for customers with special needs</h3>

<p>Three schemes are available for customers with special needs:</p>
<ul><li>An Electricity Allowance which you obtain as part of the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/extra_social_welfare_benefits/household_benefits_package.html">Household
    Benefits Package</a> </li>
  <li>Services for older people and people with disabilities </li>
  <li>The medical register for customers with home medical equipment. </li>
</ul><p><strong>Free Electricity Allowance</strong> <br>
Some customers may be eligible for an Electricity Allowance. The Allowance is
administered by the Department of Social Protection as part of the Household
Benefits Package. The Department has a set of <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/extra_social_welfare_benefits/household_benefits_package.html">guidelines
to determine who is eligible</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Services for older people and people with disabilities</strong> <br>
All suppliers of domestic customers are required to offer non-standard forms of
communication to its customers. These forms include:</p>
<ul><li>Braille/talking and large-print bills for people with visual impairment
  </li>
  <li>Use of minicom or text phones for customers with hearing difficulties
  </li>
</ul><p>To avail of any of these, customers must register with the industry's
Special Services Register. Application forms are available from your
electricity supplier. The information you supply is also passed on to ESB
Networks so it is aware of your need when contacting or visiting you.</p>

<p>Suppliers are also required to ensure that elderly customers who are
registered with them are not cut off in the winter months (November - March) if
they run into payment difficulties.</p>

<p><strong>Medical register for customers with home medical equipment</strong>
<br>
A Priority Register exists for customers who depend on electrically powered
equipment such as home dialysis machines, oxygen concentrators or artificial
ventilators If you are on the register you are contacted in advance of a
planned disruption in supply or as soon as an unplanned outage is discovered.
Also, suppliers cannot request that you be cut off over payment issues.
Application forms for the Priority Register are available from your
supplier.</p>

<h3>Codes of Practice and Customer Charters</h3>

<p>Suppliers are required to have <a href="http://www.cer.ie/customer-care/electricity/consumer-codes">codes of
practice</a> that protect customers. These cover such areas as:</p>
<ul><li>Billing </li>
  <li>Bill payment and arrears </li>
  <li>Disconnection </li>
  <li>Marketing </li>
  <li>Complaints handling </li>
  <li>Services for customers with special needs </li>
</ul><p>Suppliers are also required to produce Customer Charters with guaranteed

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Electricity meters</h3>

<p>Except in cases where there is a special agreement to the contrary, the
amount of electricity supplied to your home will be measured by a meter or
meters and other apparatus supplied and installed by ESB Networks. This
equipment remains the property of ESB Networks. </p>

<p>Only people authorised by ESB Networks are allowed to fix, connect, remove
or work upon any meter, main fusebox, seal, electric line or other apparatus
belonging to ESB Networks. In the event of unauthorised interference, (whether
by the customer or otherwise), the ESB reserves the right to estimate the
unrecorded consumption and to include the charges for the unrecorded
consumption in the customer's account. </p>

<h3>Electricity bills</h3>

<p>Electricity bills are issued every two months and are based on meter
readings or estimations of electricity consumption. Readings can be actual
readings obtained by the meter reader or readings submitted by the customer. An
ESB Networks meter reader calls to your home to read the meter four times a
year. When the meter reader fails to gain access to read the meter, he or she
leaves a card inviting you to <a shape="rect" href="https://www.esb.ie/esbnetworks/en/domestic-customers/metering/submit_meter_reading.jsp">submit
your meter reading online</a> or to dial in the reading to a special number
CallSave 1850 337 777. (This is an Interactive Voice Response System that is
available 24 hours every day.) If a reading is not received within 48 hours, an
estimated bill is issued.</p>

<p>Find advice on <a shape="rect" href="http://www.cer.ie/customer-care/electricity/reading-your-meter">reading
your meter here</a> . </p>

<p>Your supplier is required to include a standard set of information on your
bill. This includes the meter reading upon which the bill is based, the tariff
category that applies and any levies that are being applied to the bill. You
can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.cer.ie/customer-care/electricity/your-bill">read more about
the information supplied on bills here</a>.</p>

<p>Suppliers are required to offer a range of options to customers for paying
their bills. You should contact you supplier to find out what option suits
you.</p>

<h3>Electricity tariffs for domestic customers</h3>

<p>The Commission for Energy Regulation previously regulated ESB Electic
Ireland's (formerly called ESB Customer Supply) tariffs. Since April 2011, ESB
Electic Ireland, like the other suppliers, is free to set its own tariffs.</p>

<p>The Commission for Energy Regulation also regulates the charges associated
with the electricity transmission and distribution networks. The tariffs
include the cost of generating electricity, transmitting it through the
electricity network, distributing and supplying to end customers.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<h3>New connections</h3>

<p>To set up a new connection if you are moving into a house/apartment in a new
housing/apartment scheme, you will need to apply to an electricity supplier for
a domestic supply agreement. You should contact ESB Networks and supply them
with the following information:</p>
<ul><li>Your name and contact details </li>
  <li>The Meter Point Reference Number (MPRN) for your new home (available from
    the builder/developer) </li>
  <li>The address of your home as defined at the planning stage (available from
    the builder/develpoer) </li>
  <li>Electricity Supplier details </li>
</ul><p>ESB Networks will complete the installation of your meter. The builder's
electrician will switch on the electricity supply in your home.</p>

<p>If you are building your own home you will need <a href="https://www.esb.ie/esbnetworks/en/domestic-customers/single_house.jsp">apply
for a new connection to ESB Networks</a>.</p>

<h3>Moving house </h3>

<p>When you are leaving an address, you should take the meter reading, contact
your electricity supplier let them know you are moving and give the supplier
your meter reading. </p>

<p>If the house or apartment to which you are moving is new, you should contact
your electricty supplier and ESB Networks as mentioned above.</p>

<p>If the house or apartment to which you are moving was previously occupied,
you should take an ESB Meter Reading when you take over responsibility for the
premises. </p>

<p>If the house has been disconnected for less than 2 years, you will need to
apply to your supplier for a domestic supply agreement. Your supplier will
advise you about the reconnection process. If the house has been disconnected
for more than 6 months you will also have to <a shape="rect" href="https://www.esb.ie/esbnetworks/en/domestic-customers/certification_process.jsp">get
the wiring checked and certified</a> before it can be reconnected.</p>

<p>If the house has been disconnected for more than 2 years you will have to
apply to ESB Networks for a new connection.</p>

<h3>Changing Supplier</h3>

<p>If you want to change supplier you should contact your new supplier with
details of your meter number and a meter reading. You will be talked through
the switching process by the supplier who will then process your application.

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Natural gas can be used for domestic central heating, cooking, real flame
fires or tumble-drying. In addition, natural gas has a range of applications
for business customers. It is piped underground and connected to properties so
there is no need to store it. Over half a million homes and businesses are
connected to natural gas.</p>

<p>Responsibility for the natural gas pipeline infrastructure lies with <a shape="rect" href="http://www.bordgais.ie/corporate/index.jsp">Ervia</a>
(formerly Bord Gáis Éireann), a State body, wholly owned by the Government.
It is a multi-utility company, responsible for strategic national gas and water
services and related infrastructure.</p>

<p>The gas supply market in has been gradually opened to competition in recent
years. Since July 2004 all business users have been able to choose their own
supplier. Since July 2007 residential customers have been able to choose their
gas supplier. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="commission_for_energy_regulation.html">Commission
for Energy Regulation</a> licenses gas suppliers. It also has information for
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.cer.ie/customer-care">electricity and natural
gas customers</a> on its website.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l42177">Gas Networks Ireland</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.gasnetworks.ie/en-IE/">Gas Networks Ireland</a>
(formerly Bord Gáis Networks) is a division of Ervia and has responsibility
for developing, maintaining and operating the natural gas transmission and
distribution networks. Gas is brought from gas fields off the coast, and from
the North Sea gas fields through sub-sea interconnector pipelines. Natural gas
is then transported through pipelines aroundt the country and is available in
most towns and cities. You can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.bordgaisnetworks.ie/en-IE/Get-Connected/Can-I-get-gas/">view
the towns and cities with natural gas services</a> on its website. </p>

<p>Gas Networks Ireland connects all customers to its network regardless of
which gas supply company you use. You can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.bordgaisnetworks.ie/en-IE/Get-Connected/How-to-get-connected/">find
out how to get connected and the costs involved here</a>.</p>

<p>It also provides site works services to customers who wish to have their gas
connection altered in some way. There is <a shape="rect" href="http://www.bordgaisnetworks.ie/en-IE/Your-Meter/Services-and-Charges/">more
information on site work services and associated charges here</a>. </p>

<p>Gas Networks Ireland is responsible for all gas network safety and
maintenance. It carries out regular safety awareness promotions each year to
highlight the key issues concerning natural gas and safety to both natural gas
customers and to the general public. Its safety campaigns include:</p>
<ul><li>Raising the awareness of the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning </li>
  <li>What to do in the event someone smells natural gas at home or on the
    street </li>
  <li>The importance of servicing appliances </li>
</ul><p>It also operates a 24 hour emergency service line Lo-Call 1850 205 050 which
you should contact if you smell gas and suspect that gas is escaping.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="ld2f8f">Gas Meters</h2>

<p>Gas Networks Ireland installs and reads the meters that measure the gas used
in any premises. Three times a year, a Gas Networks Ireland meter reader will
call to your home to record the amount of gas used since the meter was last
read. These meter readings are then passed to your natural gas supplier, who
uses the information to prepare your gas bill.</p>

<p>If the meter reader cannot gain access to the meter, a <em>Sorry we missed
you card</em> is left for you to submit your reading. You can also submit your
meter reading directly to your supplier.</p>

<p>Estimates of your gas usage are also made between meter readings or if the
meter reader cannot gain access to the meter. To ensure that accurate estimates
are made and that you receive an accurate bill, it is important that actual
meter readings are taken.</p>

<p>When new meters are installed, they are located in external meter boxes.
This permits the meter reader to record your gas usage without disturbing you.
The meter box is locked and you have a key. You should keep this in a safe
place and only open the box to:</p>
<ul><li>Check your meter reading </li>
  <li>Turn off the gas at the meter if you smell gas at home </li>
</ul><p>If you have a meter box but do not have a key, you should contact Gas
Networks Ireland on 1850 200 694, and one will be sent to you.</p>

<p>Older meters may be located inside your home. You should ensure that the
meter reader has clear and easy access to the meter. </p>

<p>Meters are the property of Gas Networks Ireland and must not be interfered
with in any way. Interference with a meter is prohibited by law and offenders
can be prosecuted. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l41659">Natural Gas Suppliers</h2>

<p>Residential customers have been able to choose their gas supplier since
2007. You can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.cer.ie/customer-care/about-us/links#Gas-Suppliers">view a full
list of natural gas suppliers</a> on the Regulator's website. </p>

<h3>Opening and closing a gas supply account</h3>

<p>If you are moving into a property which has natural gas installed you should
contact a gas supplier to find out the supplier’s terms and conditions for
supply and to get an application form. </p>

<p>To ensure accurate billing by your supplier, it is recommended that a meter
reading is taken when the previous occupier moves out or when you move in. To
avoid the meter being locked or disconnected before you take occupancy, you
should give as much advance notice as possible of the handover.</p>

<p>You are not liable for any gas used by the previous occupier, however if you
have an outstanding gas bill from a previous address you may have to pay this
bill to avoid interruption of the supply.</p>

<p>If you are an existing natural gas customer and you are moving home or wish
to close your account, contact your supplier to find out what to do. </p>

<p>If you are moving out of your home, it is recommended that you call your
supplier in advance with a closing meter reading, your new address and the name
of the new occupant (if known). If you do not do this you will be responsible
for any gas used at the premises.</p>

<h3>Changing supplier</h3>

<p>If you want to change supplier you should contact your new supplier with
details of your meter number and a meter reading. You will be talked through
the switching process by the supplier who will then process your application.
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.cer.ie/customer-care/gas/changing-supplier">More information
on switching is available on the Regulator's website</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The regulator for the electricity and natural gas markets in Ireland is the
Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). It was initially established in 1999
under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1999/en/act/pub/0023/index.html">Electricity
Regulation Act 1999</a>. Since then it has had additional functions added to it
under other legislation, such as under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2002/en/act/pub/0010/index.html">Gas
(Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002</a>. Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/act/pub/0006/index.html">Water
Services Act 2013</a>, it is the regulator for <a href="http://www.cer.ie/water">public water and wastewater services</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1b543">Role of CER</h2>

<p>CER promotes competition in the electricity and natural gas sectors. It also
protects the interests of customers, especially the disadvantaged and the
elderly, by ensuring that standards of services are set and codes of practices
are in place.</p>

<p>CER licences electricity and natural gas companies and sets performance
standards which it enforces. It tries to ensure that the supply of natural gas
and electricity to customers is safe, secure and reliable. </p>

<p>Along with the <a shape="rect" href="http://ofreg.nics.gov.uk/">Northern
Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation (NIAUR)</a> CER runs the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.allislandproject.org/">All-Island Project</a>,
the aim of which is to create a single market for natural gas and electricity
on the island of Ireland.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="ld68c2">Consumer complaints</h2>

<p>The CER has established an Energy Customers Team to assist customers who are
having issues with their supplier or network operator. The Energy Customers
Team provides an independent complaints resolution service for customers who
have used their supplier or network operator’s complaints handling process
and are not satisfied with the outcome.</p>

<p>More information can be found on the <a href="http://www.cer.ie/customer-care">Commission’s website</a>.</p>

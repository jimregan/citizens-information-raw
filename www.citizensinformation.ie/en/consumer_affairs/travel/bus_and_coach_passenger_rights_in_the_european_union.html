<div class="topic">

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Since March 2013 bus and coach passengers have a minimum set of rights when
travelling in the European Union. <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32011R0181:EN:HTML">Regulation
181/2011</a> concerning the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport
applies to passengers travelling with regular services that operate at
specified intervals along specified routes, with passengers being picked up and
set down at predetermined stopping points. Either the boarding or the alighting
point must be within the European Union.</p>

<p>Some of the Regulation’s provisions are mandatory and apply to all
services. The other rights available under the Regulation only apply where the
scheduled distance of the service is 250 km or more.</p>

<p>An EU member state may grant an exemption from the application of the entire
Regulation for a period of 4 years in the case of a regular service where a
significant part of the service (including at least one scheduled stop)
operates outside the European Union. The exemption may be renewed once for
another 4 years.</p>

<p>The European Commission has provided an <a href="http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/index_en.htm">application
for smartphones</a> which gives information on passengers’ rights including
bus and coach passengers.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="laded0">Mandatory provisions</h2>

<p>The following provisions of the Regulation apply to all regular bus and
coach passenger services, irrespective of the scheduled distance of the
service:</p>
<ul><li>When buying a bus or coach ticket, you may not be discriminated against,
    for example, by being charged a higher price because of your nationality or
    where you are buying the ticket from.</li>
  <li>You can't be stopped from buying a ticket, making a reservation or
    getting on board because of your reduced mobility, unless this is strictly
    necessary to comply with health and safety requirements, or where the
    infrastructure cannot guarantee safe transport.</li>
  <li>Where a carrier or a <em>terminal</em> operator is liable for the loss of
    or damage to your wheelchair or other mobility equipment, the amount of
    compensation they are liable for is the cost of replacement or repair of
    the equipment lost or damaged. (A terminal means a staffed terminal and has
    facilities such as a check-in counter, waiting room or ticket office.)</li>
  <li>You have the right to adequate information throughout your travel. This
    right includes the right to be informed about passenger rights and the
    contact details of national enforcement bodies. The information should be
    available in accessible formats.</li>
  <li>Bus and coach carriers are required to set up a complaints handling
    mechanism to help passengers who are trying to avail of their rights under
    this Regulation.</li>
  <li>Every member state must designate a body responsible for the enforcement
    of this Regulation (see ‘Complaints and enforcement’ below).</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="le5cac">Long-distance services</h2>

<p>The following information covers additional passenger’s rights under the
Regulation’s provisions where the scheduled distance of the regular service
is 250 km or more. However, an EU member state may grant an exemption from
these additional rights to a purely domestic regular service for a period of 4
years, which may be renewed once for a further 4 years.</p>

<h3>Tickets</h3>

<p>Carriers must issue tickets to passengers, unless other documents give
entitlement to transport. A ticket may be issued in an electronic format.</p>

<h3>Compensation in the event of accidents</h3>

<p>You are entitled to compensation for death or personal injury, as well as
for loss of or damage to luggage, due to accidents arising out of the use of
bus or coach services. The conditions and amount of compensation is governed by
the applicable national law. The compensation is not automatic and must be
claimed in court.</p>

<p>Any maximum limit provided by the applicable national law to the
compensation shall not be less than:</p>
<ul><li>€220,000 per passenger</li>
  <li>€1,200 per item of luggage</li>
</ul><p>In the event of damage to wheelchairs, other mobility equipment or assistive
devices the amount of compensation shall always be equal to the cost of
replacement or repair of the equipment lost or damaged.</p>

<p>The carrier is required to provide you with reasonable assistance with
regard to your immediate practical needs following the accident. Such
assistance shall include, where necessary, accommodation, food, clothes,
transport and the facilitation of first aid. The carrier may limit the total
cost of accommodation to €80 per night and to a maximum of 2 nights.</p>

<p>Any assistance provided by the carrier does not constitute admission of
liability.</p>

<h3>Delays and cancellations</h3>

<p>If there is an overbooking or the carrier expects a service from a terminal
to be cancelled or delayed by more than 120 minutes beyond the scheduled time
of departure, you have the right to choose between:</p>
<ul><li>Re-routing to the final destination under comparable conditions at no
    additional costs and at the earliest opportunity</li>
  <li>Reimbursement of the full ticket price within 14 days and, where
    relevant, a free-of-charge return service to the first point of departure,
    as set out in the transport contract, at the earliest opportunity</li>
</ul><p>The same right to choose is applicable if the service is cancelled or
delayed in departure from a bus stop for more than 120 minutes.</p>

<p>The reimbursement should be paid in money, unless you accept another form of
reimbursement.</p>

<p>If the carrier fails to offer you either reimbursement or rerouting, you
have the right to compensation amounting to 50 % of the ticket price in
addition to the reimbursement. This right to compensation and the eventual
reimbursement of the ticket does not prevent you from seeking damages through
the courts in respect of loss resulting from cancellation or delay of the
service.</p>

<p>If the bus or coach breaks down during the journey, the carrier must send
another bus or coach to the place where the original bus or coach broke down,
either to:</p>
<ul><li>Continue the service and carry the passengers to their destination or</li>
  <li>Transport the passengers to a suitable waiting point or terminal from
    where continuation of the journey becomes possible.</li>
</ul><h3>Provision of information</h3>

<p>If there is a cancellation or delay in departure when you are departing from
a terminal you should be informed of the situation as soon as possible and no
later than 30 minutes after the scheduled departure time. You should also be
informed of the estimated departure time as soon as this information is
available. If you miss a connecting service due to a cancellation or delay, you
should be informed of alternative connections.</p>

<p>If it is feasible, the above information should be provided by electronic
means within the 30 minute time-limit, even if you are departing from a bus
stop, providing you have requested that you be notified electronically and have
supplied the necessary contact details.</p>

<h3>Assistance while waiting</h3>

<p>If the scheduled duration of your long distance journey is more than 3 hours
and the service is cancelled or delayed in departing from the terminal for more
than 90 minutes, you have a right to:</p>
<ul><li>Snacks, meals or refreshments in relation to the waiting time or delay,
    providing they are available or can reasonably be supplied</li>
  <li>Hotel or other accommodation, as well as transport between the terminal
    and the place of accommodation, where a stay of 1 or more nights becomes
    necessary. (The cost of accommodation is subject to a maximum of €80 per
    night and to a maximum of 2 nights.)</li>
</ul><p>The requirement to provide accommodation does not apply where the carrier
proves that the cancellation or delay is caused by severe weather conditions or
a major natural disaster.</p>

<h3>Entitlement</h3>

<p>You are not entitled to assistance or rerouting/reimbursement if you have an
open ticket that does not specify the time of departure. However, you are
entitled to them if you hold a travel pass or a season ticket.</p>

<p>The Regulation does not prevent you seeking damages in the courts in respect
of any loss that results from the cancellation or delay of the service.</p>

<h3>People with disabilities</h3>

<p>People with disabilities and those with reduced mobility have the right to
obtain a ticket and a reservation for any regular service at no extra cost.
They cannot be refused a ticket or reservation except where it is necessary in
order to meet health and safety requirements or where it is not possible to
transport them due to the design of the vehicle or infrastructure.</p>

<p>If you are refused you should be informed immediately why you are being
refused and, if you request it, you must be provided with the reasons in
writing within 5 working days. You must also be informed of any acceptable
alternative service operated by the carrier.</p>

<p>If the reasons for you being refused a booking or boarding can be removed by
the presence of someone who can provide the necessary assistance you may
request that you be accompanied by someone of your choice, free of charge.</p>

<p>If you hold a ticket or a reservation and have notified the carrier about
your specific needs as required and you are nonetheless denied boarding on the
ground of your disability or reduced mobility, you can choose between
reimbursement and rerouting (rerouting is dependent upon the availability of
appropriate travel services).</p>

<h4>Designated terminals</h4>

<p>Member states are required to designate terminals where assistance is
available for people with disabilities and those with reduced mobility free of
charge. Ireland has designated the following terminals:</p>

a complaint you should do so within 3 months of the scheduled service. You
should receive a reply within 1 month from the carrier.</p>

you did not receive a reply within 1 month of making the complaint, you can
make a complaint to the National Transport Authority. <a href="http://www.nationaltransport.ie/public-transport-services/coach-and-bus-passenger-rights/">Information

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>There are international laws which apply to the transport of passengers and
freight by rail between countries. These laws have been in existence for
decades and are known as the CIV and CIM Uniform Rules, and have been developed
by the <a href="http://www.otif.org/index.php?L=2">Intergovernmental
Organisation for International Carriage by Rail (OTIF)</a>. Over 45 countries
from Europe, Middle East and North Africa are members of OTIF.</p>

<p>The Uniform Rules are contained in the <a href="http://www.otif.org/fileadmin/user_upload/otif_verlinkte_files/07_veroeff/02_COTIF_99/COTIF_1999_01_01_2011_e.pdf">Convention
concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF 1999) (pdf)</a> and include
rules regarding liability limits in the event of death or injury of a rail
passenger, and loss or damage to luggage. The liability limits are set in <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/sdr.htm">Special Drawing Rights
(SDR)</a> which is a mix of currency values established by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF). The <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/rms_mth.aspx?reportType=CVSDR">current
value of an SDR in euro</a> is available on the IMF's website.</p>

<h3>EU Regulation</h3>

<p>In December 2009 <a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/transport/rail_transport/l24003_en.htm">Regulation
1371/2007</a> on rail passengers’ rights and obligations came into force in
the European Union. It strengthened the existing international laws mentioned
above and extended them to domestic travel. It applies to railway operators
that are licenced under <a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/transport/rail_transport/l24058_en.htm">Directive
95/18/EC</a> on the licensing of railway undertakings.</p>

<p>The European Commission has provided an <a href="http://www.nationaltransport.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/European-Commission-Press-Release-New-smartphone-app-to-give-you-all-your-rights-while-travelling-this-summer-Brussels-4th-July-2012.pdf">application
for smartphones (pdf)</a> which gives information on passengers’ rights
including rail passengers.</p>

<h3>Irish Rail</h3>

<p>Irish Rail has its own <a href="http://www.irishrail.ie/index.jsp?p=115&amp;n=156">Passenger’s
Charter</a> which sets out the standards of service you can expect when using
its services. It also deals with issues such as ticket refunds, compensation
payments and its complaints procedure. While your rights under Irish Rail’s
charter may be better in certain areas than under the EU Regulation, they have
no legal status and cannot be enforced by the National Transport Authority (see
‘Complaints and enforcement’ below).</p>

<h3>Mandatory provisions</h3>

<p>The following provisions of the Regulation apply to all rail passenger
services, both domestic and international. A railway operator must:</p>
<ul><li>Make it easy for rail passengers to buy tickets</li>
  <li>Ensure passengers’ personal security in railway stations and on
  trains</li>
  <li>Provide compensation where the operator is liable for the death or injury
    of a passenger or the loss of or damage to luggage</li>
  <li>Have adequate insurance to cover its liabilities under the Regulation</li>
  <li>Ensure that people with disabilities are not discriminated against in
    accessing rail transport, including in stations and when reserving or
    purchasing tickets</li>
  <li>When requested to, provide information on the accessibility of rail
    services to people with disabilities</li>
</ul><p>As these rights apply to both domestic and international rail services they
can be enforced by the National Transport Authority in relation to all Irish
Rail passenger services.</p>

<h3>Transition period exemption for domestic services</h3>

<p>A member state can grant an exemption to domestic rail passenger services
from the remaining provisions of the Regulation for up to 5 years. The
exemption can be renewed twice for a further 5 years each time. International
rail passenger services cannot be exempted from any of the Regulation’s
provisions, unless they start or finish their journey outside the EU. Irish
Rail has availed of this exemption for its domestic services. <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/passengers/rail/doc/summary_table.pdf">A
list of the exemptions each member state has granted is available here
(pdf)</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The following information covers passenger’s rights under the
Regulation’s provisions, some of which are mandatory and cannot be subject to
an exemption.</p>

<h3>Travel information</h3>

<p>If this non-mandatory provision applies, you are to be provided with
pre-journey information, such as:</p>
<ul><li>The general conditions applicable to the contract</li>
  <li>The timetables and the conditions for the fastest trip and for the lowest
    fares</li>
  <li>Information on any activities that likely to disrupt or delay
  services</li>
  <li>The availability of on-board services</li>
  <li>The procedures for reclaiming lost luggage and for the submission of
    complaints</li>
</ul><p>As well as being provided with information before a journey, you must also
be provided during the journey with information concerning such matters as
on-board services, the next station, delays, the main connecting services,
security and safety.</p>

<h3>Tickets</h3>

<p>It is mandatory that tickets are available to passengers through at least
one of the following points of sale:</p>
<ul><li>Ticket offices or ticket machines at all main railway stations</li>
  <li>Telephone, Internet or any other widely available information
  technology</li>
  <li>On board trains</li>
</ul><p>Where there is no ticket office or ticket machine at a station, information
should be provided at the station about where and how tickets can be bought.</p>

<h3>Liability for passengers and luggage</h3>

<p>Liability for passengers and luggage is also one of the mandatory
provisions. Under this provision, you (or your dependants) are entitled to
compensation in the event of your death or bodily injury (physical or mental),
whether the accident took place when you were on the train or while you were
boarding or leaving the train.</p>

<p>Where the railway operator is liable for the accident, they are also liable
for the total or partial loss of or damage to personal effects and hand luggage
carried by you, up to a limit of 1,400 SDRs. This also applies to animals
brought by you. However, the railway operator is not liable for property which
the passenger is responsible for supervising, unless the loss or damage is
caused by the fault of the railway operator.</p>

<p>You have a right to compensation if your registered luggage is lost or
damaged unless it was due to an error on your part or circumstances beyond the
control of the operator. You can consider an item of registered luggage to be
lost when it has not been delivered within 14 days of the date it was due to be
delivered. Damages of up to 1,200 SDRs per item of registered luggage may be
claimed.</p>

<p>When there is a delay in the delivery of an item of registered luggage, the
railway operator must pay compensation for each day it is late, up to a maximum
of 14 days. The maximum compensation payable is 14 SDRs per day.</p>

<h3>Advanced payment</h3>

<p>If this non-mandatory provision applies, the railway operator must make an
advanced payment to cover the immediate costs of death or injury as the result
of the accident and the payment must be made within 15 days. In the event of
your death the advanced payment must be at least €21,000.</p>

<p>An advance payment does not constitute recognition of liability and may be
offset against any subsequent sums that are paid. However, where a railway
operator does contest liability, it must make every reasonable effort to help
you claim compensation from a third party.</p>

<h3>Delays and cancellations</h3>

<p>The provisions in relation to delays and cancellations are not mandatory and
may only apply to international rail services.</p>

<p>Where you will be delayed more than 60 minutes due to a delayed or cancelled
train, you have a right to choose between one of the following:</p>
<ul><li>Repayment of the full cost of the ticket for the part or parts of your
    journey not made and for the part or parts already made if the journey is
    no longer serving any purpose and, if relevant, a return service to the
    first point of departure at the earliest opportunity</li>
  <li>Continuation or re-routing, under comparable transport conditions, to
    your final destination at the earliest opportunity</li>
  <li>Continuation or re-routing, under comparable transport conditions, to
    your final destination at a later date at your convenience</li>
</ul><p>Where you will be delayed more than 60 minutes and you have not chosen a
refund of the cost of your ticket as mentioned above, you may claim
compensation as follows:</p>
<ul><li>25 % of the ticket price for a delay of 60 to 119 minutes</li>
  <li>50 % of the ticket price for a delay of 120 minutes or more</li>
</ul><p>The compensation must be paid within one month. It may be paid in vouchers
or other services, but must be paid in cash if you request it. You have no
right to compensation if you were informed of the delay before buying your
ticket.</p>

<p>The railway operator is not liable for damages if the cancellation, late
running or missed connection is attributable to circumstances not connected
with the operation of the railway or to the behaviour of a third party, neither
of which the railway operator could avoid, or is due to a fault on the part of
the passenger.</p>

<h4>While you are waiting</h4>

<p>If a train is cancelled or delayed, you have the right to adequate
information about what is happening while you are waiting. If you are delayed
more than 60 minutes, you have a right to:</p>
<ul><li>Meals and refreshments in reasonable relation to the waiting time</li>
  <li>Hotel or other accommodation, and transport between the railway station
    and place of accommodation, where a stay of one or more nights becomes
    necessary</li>
  <li>Alternative transport if the train is blocked on the track</li>
</ul><h3>People with disabilities</h3>

<p>It is mandatory that people with disabilities and those with reduced
mobility have the right to obtain a ticket and a reservation for any rail
journey in the same way as other passengers and at no extra cost. When
requested to railway operators, ticket vendors or tour operators must provide
such passengers with information on the accessibility of railway services
regarding stations, platforms, rolling stock and other facilities.</p>

<p>Under the non-mandatory provisions, if you are refused a ticket or a
reservation, or you are required to be accompanied because of access rules, you
must be provided, on request, with the reasons for doing so in writing within 5
working days.</p>

<h4>Assistance to people with disabilities</h4>

<p>If the non-mandatory provision on assistance to people with disabilities
applies, you must be provided with assistance at staffed railway stations in
relation to boarding, changing to a connecting service, and disembarking.
Similarly, assistance must be provided on board or when embarking or
disembarking.</p>

<p>The assistance must be free of charge. You must notify the railway operator,
ticket vendor or tour operator from whom you buy your ticket of your need for
assistance at least 48 hours before it is needed. You must arrive at the
station at the time you are asked to, but no more than 60 minutes before the
departure or check-in time. If no arrival time is mentioned, you should arrive
30 minutes in advance.</p>

<h4>Mobility equipment</h4>

<p>Where this non-mandatory provision applies, if your mobility equipment or
other specific equipment used by you is lost, partially lost or damaged, and
the railway operator is liable, there is no limit on the compensation that can
be claimed.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="le4569">Complaints and enforcement</h2>

<p>Railway operators are required to set up a complaints handling mechanism to
help passengers who are trying to avail of their rights under this Regulation.
Information on to whom a complaint can be submitted and what language can be
used should be easily available to passengers. If you make a complaint you
should receive a reply within 1 month. Railway operators must publish the
number of complaints they receive. <a href="http://www.irishrail.ie/index.jsp?p=115&amp;n=156#PuttingThingsRight">Information
on Irish Rail’s complaint’s handling system</a> is available on its
website.</p>

<p>Every member state must designate a body responsible for the enforcement of
this Regulation. The National Transport Authority is the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/passengers/rail/doc/2007_1371_national_enforcement_bodies.pdf">designated
enforcement body (pdf)</a> in Ireland. If you are dissatisfied with an Irish
railway operator’s decision and your rights under the Regulation have been
denied or you did not receive a reply within 1 month of making the complaint,
you can make a complaint to the National Transport Authority. <a href="http://www.nationaltransport.ie/contact-us/intro-and-general-enquiries-press-contacts-and-oireachtas-liaison/rail-passenger-right/">Information
on making a complaint</a> is available on its website.</p>

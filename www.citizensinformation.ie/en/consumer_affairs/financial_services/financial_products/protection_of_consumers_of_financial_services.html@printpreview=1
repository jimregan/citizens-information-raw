<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>If you have a bank account or a loan with a financial institution, you are a
consumer of financial services. As a consumer of a financial service you have
certain rights. As in other areas of consumer law, your rights as a consumer of
financial services depend on the contract between you and the financial
institution. A contract is an agreement between two or more people that is
enforceable by law. As with all contracts, your contract with the financial
institution consists of stated terms and implied terms. Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/si/0027.html">European Communities
(Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations, 1995</a> and <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/si/0307.html">subsequent
amendments in 2000</a> any term that is found to be unfair to the consumer
cannot be enforced. </p>

<p>From June 2010 the <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:133:0066:0092:EN:PDF">Consumer
Credit Directive (2008/48/EC)</a> establishes common rules on consumer credit
aimed at harmonising certain aspects of the laws, regulations and
administrative provisions on consumer credit in the EU. The Directive covers
personal loans of between €200 and €75,000 repayable after more than a
month. The Directive does not apply to mortgages or to deferred debit cards.
You can find <a shape="rect" href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/consumers/protection_of_consumers/co0001_en.htm">further
information on the EU's Europa website</a>.</p>

<p>Legislation exists that regulates financial institutions dealings with
consumers such as the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Consumer
Credit Act 1995</a>. A <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/processes/consumer-protection-code/Pages/codes-of-conduct.aspx">Consumer
Protection Code for financial institutions</a> also exists that prescribes how
a financial institution deals with consumers. The Central Bank of Ireland is
the body that enforces this code and this legislation. </p>

<p>In order to enforce your rights you need to be aware of what those rights
are. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) provides
information to consumers on their rights and on the costs, risks and benefits
of different financial products. This information also helps you to access the
financial services that are most suitable to you. The CCPC maintains <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/your-money">financial information</a> on its
website for consumers.</p>

<h3>Protection for your savings and investments</h3>

<p>The Central Bank is responsible for the regulation of the following
firms:</p>
<ul><li>Banks </li>
  <li>Building societies </li>
  <li>Insurance companies </li>
  <li>Investment management firms </li>
  <li>Insurance and investment intermediaries (brokers and agents) </li>
  <li>Mortgage intermediaries (brokers) </li>
  <li>Stockbrokers </li>
  <li>Collective investment schemes </li>
  <li>Credit unions </li>
  <li>Moneylenders </li>
  <li>Bureaux de change </li>
  <li>Other retail credit firms </li>
  <li>Home reversion firms </li>
</ul><p>Before dealing with any of these firms, check that they are authorised to
trade by the Central Bank. This authorisation protects you from unscrupulous
traders. To check whether the company you are dealing with is authorised,
contact the Registers Department of the Central Bank (see 'Where to apply'
below). </p>

<h3>Compensation schemes</h3>

<p>There are a number of compensation schemes. </p>

<p>The <strong>Deposit Guarantee Scheme</strong> compensates consumers for
money lost from current and deposit accounts where a bank, building or credit
union is unable to return their money due to financial difficulties. The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/pdf/2015/en.si.2015.0516.pdf">European
Communities (Deposit Guarantee Schemes) Regulations 2015</a> replaces the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/si/0168.html">European Communities
(Deposit Guarantee Schemes) Regulations 1995</a> establishing the Scheme.</p>

<p>The payment process is only initiated once it has been established that the
institution cannot return payments made to it due to its financial condition.
The maximum claim per person is 100% of all deposits held by the financial
institution up to a maximum of €100,000. </p>

<p>The Deposit Guarantee Scheme is funded by authorised credit institutions.
The compensation scheme of another EU country applies in the case of a bank or
financial institution authorised and regulated in another EU state but
operating here on a branch basis under EU rules, unless the branch has
confirmed to the Central Bank its intention to participate in the Deposit
Guarantee Scheme.</p>

<p>More <a href="http://www.depositguarantee.ie/en/about-us">detailed
information on the Deposit Guarantee Scheme</a> is available from the Central
Bank of Ireland. Information on relevant schemes from other EU countries is
available on the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/deposit-guarantee-scheme">Competition and
Consumer Protection Commission's (CCPC) website</a>.</p>

<p>On 30 September 2008 the Government introduced an <strong>unlimited
Government guarantee</strong> for all deposits exceeding €100,000, among
other things, in certain Irish banks. The scheme known as the <strong>Credit
Institutions Financial Support Scheme (CIFS)</strong> expired on 29 September
2010. </p>

<p>In December 2009 the Government introduced the <strong>Eligible Liabilities
Guarantee Scheme (ELG)</strong> for term deposit accounts exceeding €100,000
in the same Irish banks. The scheme covered term deposits until they matured
(up to a maximum five years), provided the bank was covered by the scheme when
the deposit was placed. If the bank became a member of the scheme after the
deposit was placed, the deposit was covered by the CIFS Scheme until 29
September 2010. </p>

<p>The ELG scheme also covered on demand current and deposit accounts exceeding
€100,000, regardless of when the deposit was placed. Notice accounts were
similarly covered provided notice of withdrawl was made before the scheme
ended. </p>

<p>The banks covered by the two schemes were:</p>
<ul><li>Allied Irish Bank </li>
  <li>Bank of Ireland </li>
  <li>Irish Life and Permanent </li>
  <li>Educational Building Society </li>
  <li>ICS Building Society </li>
</ul><p><strong></strong>The ELG scheme ended on 28 March 2013. If you had a fixed
term deposit covered by the scheme before 28 March 2013, the protection of the
scheme remains in place until the end of the term, up to a maximum of five
years. This does not affect deposits up to €100,000 which continue to be
covered by the Deposit Protection Scheme.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/government-guarantee">Further information on
the ELG scheme</a> is available on the CCPC's consumer website.</p>

<p>Some banks that operate in Ireland are regulated in their home country. If
you have an account in such a bank, you would usually make a claim under the
compensation schemes that are in place in the country where the institution is
regulated. </p>

<p>The Investor Compensation Company Ltd (ICCL) operates the <strong>Investor
Compensation Scheme</strong>. The ICCL was set up under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0037/index.html">Investor
Compensation Act 1998</a>. The purpose of the Scheme is to compensate clients
of failed authorised investment firms. If a member firm of the Scheme goes out
of business and cannot return your investments or money, you may be entitled to
make a claim under the scheme. The maximum claim per person is 90% of all
deposits held by the financial institution up to a maximum of €20,000.</p>

<p>Further information on the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.investorcompensation.ie/index.php">Investor Compensation
Scheme</a> is available on the ICCL website.</p>

<p>As a consumer, you should protect your rights and avoid dealing with
unregulated financial service providers.</p>

<h3>Who is involved in regulation?</h3>

<h4>The Central Bank of Ireland</h4>

<p>The arrangements for the regulation of the financial services sector have
changed considerably in recent years with the most recent changes, implemented
under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0023/index.html">Central
Bank Reform Act 2010</a>, making the <a href="http://www.financialregulator.ie/about-us/Pages/default.aspx">Central
Bank of Ireland</a> responsible for regulation. The Central Bank’s Consumer
Director has specific responsibility for </p>
<ul><li>The protection of consumers and/or investors under a range of legislation
    including the Consumer Credit Act 1995, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0011/index.html">Investment
    Intermediaries Act 1995</a>, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0009/index.html">Stock
    Exchange Act 1995</a>, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1989/en/act/pub/0016/index.html">Central
    Bank Act 1989</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1989/en/act/pub/0003/index.html">Insurance
    Act 1989</a>. </li>
  <li>Monitoring the provision of financial services to consumers. </li>
</ul><h4>Registrar of Credit Unions</h4>

<p>The Central Bank appoints the Registrar of Credit Unions who regulates <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/financial_institutions/credit_unions.html">credit
unions</a>. The Registrar is required to inform and assist the Consumer
Director in the Central Bank in relation to any complaint about a credit union.

<h4><span>Financial Services Ombudsman</span></h4>

<p>The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004
provides for the appointment of a statutory <a shape="rect" href="http://financialombudsman.ie/">Financial Services Ombudsman</a>. The
scheme is financed by the providers of financial services. The Ombudsman’s
role is as an independent mediator dealing with individual complaints against
financial services firms. Complaints must first be made to the financial
institution concerned and then to the Ombudsman if you are still dissatisfied.
The Ombudsman provides a mediated solution. The Ombudsman has the power to
order financial institutions to do certain things and to pay compensation.
Their decisions will generally be binding on the financial institutions
(subject to the right of appeal to the High Court). Read <a shape="rect" href="../../consumer_protection/consumer_complaints/financial_services_ombudsman.html">more
about the Financial Services Ombudsman's office</a> here.</p>

<h4><span>Competition and Consumer Protection Commission</span></h4>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nca.ie/">Competition and Consumer
Protection Commission</a> has statutory responsibility for the regulation of
pawnbrokers and credit intermediaries (for example garages that offer finance
on new or used cars). The office also monitors and investigates complaints in
relation to the advertising of credit by credit intermediaries.</p>

<h4><span>FIN-NET</span></h4>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/fin-net/index_en.htm">FIN-NET is an
EU-wide out-of-court complaints network for financial services</a>. It has been
designed particularly to facilitate the out-of-court resolution of consumer
disputes when the service provider is established in an EU Member State other
than that where the consumer lives. </p>

<h3>Fraud</h3>

<p>Financial fraud has risen in the past few years as criminals seek ways to
access personal financial details. </p>

<p>Personal financial details include your:</p>
<ul><li>Bank account number, </li>
  <li>Personal identity numbers (PIN) , </li>
  <li>Credit card details </li>
  <li>Debit card details </li>
  <li>ATM card details </li>
  <li>Phone and internet banking details </li>
</ul><p>It is very important that you disclose your personal financial details only
to reputable traders.</p>

<p>Criminals have been known to access your personal financial details by
impersonating your bank. Beware of unsolicited letters, e-mails and telephone
calls you receive asking you to confirm your personal financial details. If you
receive a letter stating that you have won money from a company that you have
never heard of before they may be looking for bank account details. </p>

<p>Never write your personal identity number (PIN) down. In particular, do not
keep this number with your bankcards - memorise it. <span>Never disclose your
PIN to anyone</span> - your PIN is personal information that your bank would
never ask you to state. Your bank may ask you to input your pin to your phone
or a PIN terminal at your bank branch or ATM. If you have difficulty memorising
your PIN you can change it to a number that you can remember. Avoid memorising
a number that a criminal might be able to guess - such as a birthday. Changing
your PIN is easy to do at an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) or at the bank
counter.</p>

<p>Report any lost or stolen cards as soon as you notice them missing. If you
don’t you may be liable for purchases made fraudulently on your card.</p>

<p>The best way to protect yourself from fraud is to keep your cards and
personal financial details secure. </p>

<p>In the case of credit cards, a new service - chip and PIN - has been
introduced to make credit cards more secure. If you have a chip and PIN
facility on your card (a gold coloured computer chip will be visible on your
card) you type in a PIN into the retailers machine instead of signing dockets.
<span>Never use your credit card PIN or other PIN on the internet or over the
phone. </span></p>

<p>A frequent financial services scam is where sales persons use high-pressure
sales tactics over the telephone, by mail or in person. These scams are called
‘boiler rooms operations’ where the sales person put you under pressure to
buy worthless or high-risk shares, foreign currency or other investments. If
you are offered an investment deal, <a href="http://registers.centralbank.ie/">check if the financial institution is
authorised by the Central Bank</a> by phoning Lo-Call 1890 777 777. </p>

<p>Particular laws exist to protect you if you are <a shape="rect" href="../../consumer_protection/consumer_rights/distance_selling.html">buying
products and services by distance selling</a>. There are also laws that deal
with <a shape="rect" href="../../telecommunications_and_postal_services/dealing_with_unsolicited_direct_marketing.html">unsolicited
commercial email</a> which can help to ensure that your personal details remain
private.</p>

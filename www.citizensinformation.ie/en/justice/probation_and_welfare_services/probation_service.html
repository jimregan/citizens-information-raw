<p>The Probation Service is the lead agency in the assessment and management of
offenders (those convicted of an offence) in the community. It works with
offenders and others to reduce offending and to make communities safer places.
It is an agency within the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>

<h3>Assessments for the courts</h3>

<p>The Probation Service undertakes assessments reports on offenders for the
criminal courts, when requested by the trial judge. There are <a href="http://www.probation.ie/EN/PB//WebPages/WP16000033">2 types of offender
assessment report</a>:</p>
<ul><li>Pre-sanction report (also known as a probation report) - the offender is
    assessed as to suitability for a <a href="../criminal_law/criminal_trial/types_of_sentences.html">non-custodial
    sentence</a></li>
  <li>Community service report - the offender is assessed as to suitability for
    unpaid work in the community instead of going to prison</li>
</ul><p>The service also prepares victim reports for the courts when required. These
reports assess the impact of offending on <a href="../victims_of_crime/victims_and_the_probation_and_welfare_service.html">victims
of crime</a>, usually violent crime.</p>

<h3>Supervision of offenders</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.probation.ie/EN/PB//WebPages/WP16000059">supervision
of offenders</a> in the community forms the majority of the Probation
Serviceâ€™s work. Someone who is placed on supervision is required to maintain
regular contact with their supervising probation officer and comply with all
conditions of the order. The most commonly used orders for supervision are:</p>
<ul><li>Probation order - the offender gives an undertaking to the court that
    they will be of good behaviour, avoid further crime and adhere to the
    conditions of the order</li>
  <li>Post-release supervision order - a sex offender can be sentenced to a
    period of supervision following their release from prison</li>
</ul><p>A judge may also suspend all or part of prison sentence for a period of time
on the condition the offender remains under the supervision of a probation
officer for the specified time.</p>

<p>The Probation Service also supervises prisoners who are on temporary release
from custody with specific conditions of supervision by the Service. Life
sentence prisoners on temporary release are obliged to co-operate and comply
with supervision by the Service. Such prisoners normally remain subject to
supervision for the remainder of their lives.</p>

<h3>Community service</h3>

<p>As an alternative to a prison sentence a court may make a community service
order where the offender is required to do unpaid work (40 to 240 hours) in the
community. The Probation Service assesses the suitability of the offender for
<a href="http://www.probation.ie/EN/PB//WebPages/WP16000055">community
service</a>, organises the work placement and manages the offender on behalf of
the court.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>Young Persons Probation, a <a href="http://www.probation.ie/EN/PB//WebPages/WP16000038">specialised division
of the Probation Service</a> works with children aged 12-18 years who come
before the courts or who are in children detention schools. The Probation
Service is involved in the supervision of a number of the <a href="../children_and_young_offenders/community_sanctions.html">community
sanctions available under the Children Act, 2001</a>.</p>

<h3>Prisons</h3>

<p>Most of the <a href="http://www.probation.ie/EN/PB//WebPages/WP16000036">work the Probation
Service does in prisons</a> is with prisoners who will be under their
supervision when they are released. They work with a prison-based team that
includes the prison governor and other services, to help the prisoner manage
their sentence and settle back into the community.</p>

<p>The Probation Service prepares assessment reports on prisoners for the <a href="../prison_system/parole_board_of_ireland.html">Parole Board</a>. It
also produces assessment reports, requested by the courts, on people remanded
in custody while awaiting trial.</p>

<h3>Repatriation of prisoners</h3>

<p>The Probation Service provides assessment reports on prisoners being
considered for transfer to their country of origin by the Minister for Justice
and Equality, as required in applications under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0016/index.html">Transfer
of Sentenced Persons Acts 1995</a> and <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0041/index.html">1997</a>.</p>

<h3>Working in partnership</h3>

<p>The Probation Service also works in partnership with a range of other bodies
to reduce offending, develop local responses to crime and issues affecting it,
and to improve public safety and social inclusion. This involves work in such
areas as drugs, homelessness and domestic violence.</p>

<p>Probation Service staff in the community and in prisons refer offenders to
<a href="http://www.probation.ie/EN/PB/sectionpage?readform">community
projects</a> around the country, to enhance their re-integration and
resettlement.</p>

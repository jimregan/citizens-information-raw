<p>Taking a few sensible precautions can help you to enjoy your stay in Ireland
and avoid becoming a victim of crime. </p>

<h3>Things to remember</h3>

<p>Carry a handbag or shoulder bag that can be held securely.</p>

<p>Keep a close eye on your bag in crowded streets, shops, restaurants, cafes
and pubs.</p>

<p>When visiting the city centre area, park your car in one of the controlled
car parks and keep the parking ticket with you.</p>

<p>Always lock your car securely when leaving it unattended, even for short
periods of time.</p>

<p>When checking into your accommodation, ask the receptionist about secure car
parking.</p>

<p>If you are carrying cash and valuables, make sure that they are secure on
your person, e.g., in a money-bag underneath clothing.</p>

<p>If you are travelling in a couple or group, divide your money among
yourselves.</p>

<p>Keep reference numbers of your travellers' cheques separate from the cheques
themselves - this will enable you to cancel stolen cheques quickly in an
emergency.</p>

<p>Keep photocopies of all your travel documents separate from the documents
themselves. </p>

<h3>Things to avoid</h3>

<p><span>Never</span> leave luggage or valuables exposed inside a parked car or
luggage attached to a roof rack.</p>

<p><span>Never</span> carry your passport or large amounts of cash with you or
leave them in your room - use the security facilities that may be available at
your accommodation. </p>

<p><span>Never</span> give money to children or people begging - it only
encourages this activity.</p>

<p><span>Never</span> pitch tents or camp in open spaces, unapproved sites and
public areas - camp only on approved sites. </p>

<h3>If you are the victim of a crime</h3>

<p>If you are a visitor to Ireland and have been the victim of a crime, you
should report it immediately. The Gardai will provide a translator for you if
required. The Gardai will also refer you to the Tourist Assistance Service. </p>

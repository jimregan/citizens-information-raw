<p>Neighbourhood Watch is a crime prevention programme aimed at getting local
communities in Ireland actively involved in observing and reporting suspicious
activities. The programme involves creating a partnership between the Gardai
and the community, which is designed to prevent crime and to help create a
better environment in which to live. </p>

<p>The impetus to launch a Neighbourhood Watch Scheme may come from the local
community or it may result from an approach from the Gardai. Normally, the
local Superintendent will first arrange a meeting of interested individuals at
which he/she will outline local crime trends, particular crime problems in the
area, and ways in which residents can help the Gardai. </p>

<p>While Neighbourhood Watch is not a universal remedy for crime, it does have
great potential in preventing certain types of crime, most notably burglary. It
can also play a major role in easing the frequently unjustified, but
understandable, anxiety and fear of crime felt by many citizens. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Each Neighbourhood Watch group should establish its own procedures and
appoint or elect its own officers. The following steps should be followed in
setting up a Neighbourhood Watch scheme: </p>
<ul><li>All households in the area are surveyed. </li>
  <li>If the survey indicates sufficient support for the establishment of a
    scheme, the results are conveyed to the Divisional Officer who, in his/her
    discretion, decides on the formal establishment of the Scheme in that
    particular area. </li>
  <li>Co-ordinators for the various streets and areas are selected and
    appointed at a public meeting following approval for the establishment of
    the Scheme. The chief role of the co-ordinators is to act as a point of
    first contact for members of the Scheme, to receive and distribute
    information and to recruit new members. Through the co-ordinators, other
    projects such as Property Marking or a local Newsletter may be established.
    The co-ordinators will hold periodic meetings to discuss different issues
    as they arise. </li>
  <li>The Gardai provides every resident who joins a Neighbourhood Watch Scheme
    with information. </li>
  <li>A local Garda is appointed to liaise with each scheme. </li>
</ul><p>There is <a href="http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=75">more
information on Neighbourhood Watch</a> on the Garda Síochána website.</p>

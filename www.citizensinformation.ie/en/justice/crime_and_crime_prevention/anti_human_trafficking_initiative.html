<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Human trafficking involves the transporting of men, women and children for
the purpose of sexual or labour exploitation, or for removal of their organs.
Victims are trafficked into a range of hazardous types of work, including farm
work, sweatshops, domestic servitude, forced prostitution and are subjected to
sexual abuse and other forms of violence.</p>

<p>Trafficking also involves the use of fear, force, deception, threats or
abduction. When children are trafficked, however, no violence, deception or
threat needs to be involved. Simply transporting them into exploitative
conditions constitutes trafficking. </p>

<h3>Human Trafficking Offences </h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2008/act/8/enacted/en/html">Criminal
Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008</a> makes it an offence to traffic in adults
or children for the purpose of their sexual or labour exploitation or the
removal of their organs. In addition, it makes it an offence to sell or
purchase (or offer to sell or purchase) any person for any purpose. If you are
found guilty of any of these offences, penalties of up to life imprisonment can
be imposed. </p>

<p>It is also an offence to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the
purpose of prostitution. It is punishable <a shape="rect" href="../criminal_law/criminal_trial/criminal_trial.html">on indictment</a> by
up to 5 years in prison.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l40251">Human Trafficking Initiative </h2>

<p>Ireland is a member of a <em>European G6</em> initiative against trafficking
in humans by criminals. (The European G6 is an unofficial group made up of the
six EU member states with the largest populations.) The other five countries
involved in the initiative are the United Kingdom, Poland, Italy, Spain and the
Netherlands and it is supported by <a shape="rect" href="http://www.europol.europa.eu/">Europol</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.interpol.int/">Interpol</a> and <a shape="rect" href="http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/">Eurojust</a>. The initiative involves:
</p>
<ul><li>Intelligence gathering </li>
  <li>Awareness raising </li>
  <li>Law enforcement activity </li>
  <li>Victim protection </li>
</ul><h3>Blue blindfold awareness campaign </h3>

<p>As part of the initiative’s human trafficking awareness raising campaign
the concept of a blue blindfold is being used to encourage people not to close
their eyes to human trafficking. You are asked to look around and be aware of
situations which may indicate a trafficking crime and to report any suspicions
to the <a shape="rect" href="../law_enforcement/garda_siochana_national_police_force.html">Garda
Síochána</a>.</p>

<p>Information on <a shape="rect" href="http://www.blueblindfold.gov.ie/website/bbf/bbfweb.nsf/page/knowthesigns-en">indicators
of human trafficking</a>, which can help you identify victims, is available at
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.blueblindfold.gov.ie">www.blueblindfold.gov.ie</a>. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l1e7c3">Reporting suspicions of trafficking</h2>

<p>If you wish to report your suspicions of human trafficking confidentially,
you can: </p>
<ul><li>Phone Freephone 1800 250 025 </li>
  <li>Email <a shape="rect" href="mailto:blueblindfold@garda.ie">blueblindfold@garda.ie</a> </li>
</ul><p>Victims who are trafficked into Ireland are allowed to remain in the country
for 45 days for a period of <em>recovery and reflection</em>. Other <a shape="rect" href="http://www.blueblindfold.gov.ie/website/bbf/bbfweb.nsf/page/victimsupportcontacts-en">victim
supports</a> can be provided, if necessary. Victims are required to co-operate
with the Gardaí.</p>

<p>Where the victim wishes to help the Gardaí in any investigation or
prosecution in relation to the alleged trafficking, a further six months period
of residence is provided to allow him/her to do so. This period can be extended
if required. </p>

<p>The Legal Aid Board provides <a href="http://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/Our-Services/Legal-Aid-Services/Common-legal-problems/Human-trafficking/Legal-Advice-for-potential-Victims-of-Human-Trafficking.html">legal

human trafficking.</p>

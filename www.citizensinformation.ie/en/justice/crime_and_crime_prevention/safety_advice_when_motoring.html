<p>Taking some basic precautions can help you avoid becoming a victim of crime
while driving.</p>

<h3>Safety while driving</h3>
<ul><li>Always lock your doors and keep your windows closed as much as possible
  </li>
  <li>Make sure your handbag and any valuables are kept out of sight </li>
  <li>Carry all luggage or shopping in the boot and leave the back seat empty
  </li>
  <li>Never leave jackets or coats hanging in the back seat as these can be
    stolen while your car is stopped in traffic </li>
  <li>Use your horn if someone approaches your windows or a car seems to be
    trying to make you stop </li>
  <li>Study your route in advance if you are driving through unfamiliar
    territory. You should carry an adequate map and avoid having to ask for
    directions. On longer journeys, tell someone your route and when you expect
    to reach your destination. </li>
  <li>If you think you are being followed, drive into the car park of the
    nearest Garda station, or failing that, to a busy public place, for
    example, a garage forecourt </li>
  <li>When stopped in traffic, make sure you have enough space to pull out from
    behind the car in front </li>
  <li><span>Never</span> give lifts to strangers</li>
</ul><h3>Safety while parking</h3>

<p>You should choose a well-lit spot to park in. If you are parking in daylight
but returning much later, you should think about what the space will look like
in darkness. Where possible, you should reverse into a parking space to enable
you to drive out. When returning to your car, you should have your keys in your
hand to avoid having to search through a bag or coat. </p>

<h3>Safety at garages</h3>

<p>If you are parking in a garage, you should take the same precautions against
personal attack as you would parking anywhere else. </p>

<p>Never leave car doors unlocked while paying for fuel and do not leave
valuables in plain sight in the car while it is inside the garage.</p>

<h3>Avoiding breakdowns</h3>

<p>You should keep your car in good working order. You should:</p>
<ul><li>Check the oil, battery and the tyre pressures regularly </li>
  <li>Avoid letting the fuel tank run close to empty </li>
  <li>Ensure that your spare wheel is in good condition </li>
  <li>Think about carrying an automatic latex puncture repair aerosol, which
    will to get you to the nearest garage </li>
  <li>Carry a set of jump leads, some basic tools and a torch </li>
  <li>Carry a mobile phone </li>
</ul><h3>If your car breaks down</h3>
<ul><li>If possible, stop your car in a well-lit spot </li>
  <li>If you have to stop on the motorway hard shoulder, leave the car and
    remain out of the vehicle with the passenger door open. Statistics have
    shown that many accidents that occur on motorways involve vehicles parked
    on the hard shoulder. Lock all other doors so you can secure yourself
    inside the vehicle quickly if you are threatened. If you are on a secondary
    or minor road, remain in the car with all doors locked. </li>
  <li>Carry a personal alarm, and use your horn if you feel you are in danger
  </li>
  <li>If your car breaks down in a remote place and you are alone,
    <span>never</span> hitch a lift. </li>
</ul><h3>If you think you've seen an accident</h3>

<p>If you see an accident or incident or if someone tries to flag you down, ask
yourself whether it is genuine and whether you could help. It is often safer to
report what you have seen to the police over the phone. </p>

<p>The Seniors Alert Scheme provides grant support for the supply of equipment
to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in
their homes. The scheme, which is run by <a href="https://www.pobal.ie/Pages/Home.aspx">Pobal</a>, replaced the Scheme of
Community Support for Older People in May 2010. The grant assistance is made
available through community and voluntary groups registered with Pobal.</p>

<h3>Who is eligible for grant support?</h3>

<p>The scheme provides assistance to older people. To be eligible you must
be:</p>
<ul><li>Aged 65 or over and have limited means or resources </li>
  <li>Living alone or with someone who also meets the eligibility criteria </li>
  <li>Living in the area covered by the community group administering the grant
    support </li>
  <li>Able to benefit from the equipment being supplied </li>
  <li>Willing to maintain contact with the community group </li>
</ul><h3>What type of equipment can be supplied? </h3>

<p>Grant support is provided towards the cost of purchasing and installing
monitored personal alarms, as well as additional or replacement pendants.
Equipment supplied under the scheme remains the property of the community
group. </p>

<h3>How is an application for a grant made? </h3>

<p>An application for a grant is made by the registered community group for
your area. When a community group identifies an older person in its area as
needing assistance, it:</p>
<ul><li>Assesses the person’s eligibility for the scheme and completes the
    application form</li>
  <li>Identifies the equipment required and obtains quotations from
  suppliers</li>
  <li>Submits the application with supporting documentation to the Department.
  </li>
</ul><p>Groups can apply for grants all year round.</p>

<h3>What groups can register for the scheme?</h3>

<p>Groups wishing to participate in the scheme need to register with Pobal
first. Community, voluntary and not-for-profit organisations are eligible to
register. They must have a recognised structure and be able to demonstrate a
capability of managing the grants. They must also have a record of working with
older people in the community. A group will not be able to register where there
is an existing group operating the scheme in the area.</p>

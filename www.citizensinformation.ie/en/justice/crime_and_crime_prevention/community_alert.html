<p>The Community Alert programme is a community-based crime prevention, care
and safety programme for rural communities. It has a particular emphasis on
older and more vulnerable people in rural communities. </p>

<p>The programme was established in 1984 and is managed by <a shape="rect" href="http://www.muintir.ie/">Muintir na Tíre</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="../law_enforcement/garda_siochana_national_police_force.html">Garda
Síochána</a>. It is funded by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.justice.ie/">Department of Justice and Equality</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://health.gov.ie/">Department of Health</a>. </p>

<p>The programme aims to improve the quality of life in rural communities
through:</p>
<ul><li>Reducing opportunities for crimes to occur </li>
  <li>Encouraging neighbourliness and self-reliance </li>
  <li>Promoting accident prevention and personal safety </li>
</ul><h3>Community alert groups</h3>

<p>The Community Alert programme operates through a network of community alert
groups, each of which is responsible for a particular area. A group may be set
up in response to community demand or as a result of Garda contact. There are
about 1250 such groups throughout the country.</p>

<p>Each group has an elected Community Alert Committee which manages the group
and a Community Alert Area Coordinator who maintains contact with a Garda
Liaison Officer. Resource materials are provided by the Garda Síochána.</p>

<p>Further information on the Community Alert programme and on setting up a
community alert group is available on the <a shape="rect" href="http://muintir.ie/setting-up-a-muintir-group/setting-up-a-community-alert-group/">Muintir
na Tíre website</a> and in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.garda.ie/Documents/User/Community%20Alert%20Handbook.pdf">Community
Alert handbook (pdf)</a>. </p>

<h3>Community Text Alert</h3>

<p>Community Text Alert is an Initiative to facilitate immediate communication
from the Garda Síochána to the public. The Garda Síochána provide
information by text or e-mail to each registered community contact” and they,
in turn forward the information by text or e-mail to all members of their
Community Group.</p>

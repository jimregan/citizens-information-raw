<p>Drug dealing is a serious problem affecting many communities. One of the
biggest barriers to dealing effectively with drug dealers is the use of
intimidation by drug dealers to prevent people from reporting drug dealing.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l7001f">Dial to Stop Drug Dealing</h2>

<p>Dial to Stop Drug Dealing is an initiative to tackle drug dealing in local
communities around Ireland. It provides a confidential and completely anonymous
way for individuals to pass on information on drug dealing in their local
community. When people are reporting drug dealing activity, they are never
asked for their names or addresses, or any other information which might
identify them. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l2581b">How to report suspicions of drug dealing</h2>

<p>Following a review of the initiative, since 2012 anyone wishing to pass on
information on drug dealing should call the <a href="http://www.crimestoppers.ie/index.php?p=home">Crimestoppers</a> freephone
confidential number <strong>1800 25 00 25</strong>.</p>

<p>If you have information on drug dealing activity in your community you can
telephone the freephone number. You will get through to a trained operator who
will ask you for your information and nothing more. The calls are handled by
staff that have been trained to deal with the sensitivities around the issue.
You will not be asked for your name and your number will not be traced. No one
will know that you have called. </p>

<p>The information gathered is passed on directly to the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=30">Garda National Drugs Unit
(GNDU)</a> which assesses its usefulness. The GNDU passes relevant information
on to the Gardaí in the specified area for investigation. The Gardaí can use
the information to build a case against a known drug dealer, to investigate new
allegations of drug dealing activity in a community or to make an arrest.</p>

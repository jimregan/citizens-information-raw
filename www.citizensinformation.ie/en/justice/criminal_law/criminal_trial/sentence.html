<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Sentencing involves a <a shape="rect" href="../../courtroom/judge.html">judge</a> deciding what the criminal justice
system should do with a person found guilty of an offence. If a court in
Ireland has found you guilty or you have pleaded guilty, the judge will decide
the sentence that is to be imposed on you.</p>

<p>For some offences, there are minimum and maximum sentences that the judge
must impose. For example, for some road traffic offences, the judge is obliged
to disqualify offenders from driving for a minimum of two years. <br>
There are mandatory sentences for some offences. For example, if a court finds
you guilty of murder, the judge is obliged to impose a sentence of imprisonment
for life. </p>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1907/act/17/enacted/en/html">Probation
of Offenders Act 1907</a>, a judge in the <a shape="rect" href="../../courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a> may decide
that the facts alleged against you have been proven but may decide not to
convict you. This is a form of second chance which the judge has the discretion
to apply. The charge may be dismissed or you may be conditionally
discharged.</p>

<h3>Sentencing of children </h3>

<p>The information given here relates to offences committed by adults. Children
(that is, people aged under 18) can be charged and penalised in the way
described here but there are other considerations which must be taken into
account. The prosecution of children is governed by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Children
Act 2001</a>. </p>

<p>In practice, children under the age of 12 are almost never prosecuted. It is
policy to avoid the prosecution of children under the age of 18 unless the
conditions for the <a shape="rect" href="../../children_and_young_offenders/diversion_activities_and_programmes_for_young_offenders.html">Garda
Diversion Programme</a> have not been met or the offence is a particularly
serious one. The Childrens Act 2001 provides for a range of alternative
penalties for children who have offended.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2006/A2606.pdf">Criminal
Justice Act 2006 (pdf)</a> sets the age in relation to criminal responsibility.
Children under 12 may not be charged with most criminal offences but children
age 10 or 11 can be charged with the offences of murder, manslaughter, rape or
aggravated sexual assault. You can read more about criminal responsibility in
the document <a shape="rect" href="../../children_and_young_offenders/children_and_the_criminal_justice_system_in_ireland.html">Children
and the criminal justice system</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l880fe">Sentencing</h2>

<p>Under the Irish legal system it is always a judge (a panel of judges in the
case of the Special Criminal Court or the <a shape="rect" href="../../courts_system/court_of_appeal.html">Court of Appeal</a>) who
imposes the sentence. In jury trials in the Circuit Criminal Court and the
Central Criminal Court, the jury’s role is to decide whether you are guilty
or not guilty. The jury has no role in sentencing you. This decision is left up
to the judge after listening to your legal representative's (that is, your <a shape="rect" href="../../courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor’s</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../../courtroom/barristers.html">barrister's</a>)
submission. </p>

<h3>How does a judge decide on a sentence?</h3>

<p>When considering what sentence to impose on you, the judge follows a
two-step procedure:</p>
<ol><li>Decide what the sentence should be in light of the seriousness of the
    offence. </li>
  <li>Reduce that sentence in the light of any mitigating or excusing factors
    given on your behalf. </li>
</ol><p>There are a number of important factors that a judge must have regard to,
when sentencing you. It is a matter for your solicitor or barrister, on your
behalf, to urge the judge to consider these factors and what weight or
importance should be given to each. </p>

<p>When deciding which sentence to impose on you, the judge considers: </p>
<ul><li>Whether or not you pleaded guilty to the offence </li>
  <li>The facts of the offence - the circumstances in which the offence
    occurred </li>
  <li>Whether there were any aggravating factors in relation to the offence -
    such as particularly violent or cruel behaviour </li>
  <li>Your previous criminal record </li>
  <li>Your character </li>
  <li>Your age </li>
  <li>Your family circumstances </li>
  <li>Whether you are employed </li>
  <li>Whether you are sorry for what you have done </li>
  <li>Whether certain types of treatment may help or reform you </li>
  <li>The impact of the offence on the victim </li>
  <li>Any other relevant information about you (for example, if you are in bad
    health) </li>
</ul><p>See "Further information" below on the factors considered.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l022f0">Types of sentences</h2>

<p>There are a large range of sentences available to judges that can be imposed
on someone found guilty of an offence. These can be classified as follows:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="../../prison_system/prisons_and_places_of_detention.html">Imprisonment</a>
  </li>
  <li>Suspended sentences </li>
  <li>Community service orders </li>
  <li>Fines </li>
  <li>Curfew, exclusion and <a shape="rect" href="../../law_enforcement/restriction_on_movement_orders.html">restriction
    on movement orders </a></li>
  <li>Probation </li>
  <li>Binding over </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="court_poor_box.html">The Poor Box</a> </li>
</ul><p>There are a number of secondary options available to judges, depending on
the offence: </p>
<ul><li>Disqualification </li>
  <li>Forfeiture and confiscation </li>
  <li>Compensation </li>
  <li>Endorsement and <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/driving_offences/penalty_points_for_driving_offences.html">penalty
    points for road traffic offences</a> </li>
</ul><p>There are additional options for sex and drug trafficking offenders. You can
read more about sentencing in the <a shape="rect" href="types_of_sentences.html">document on types of sentences</a>. Information
on sentencing decisions is available on the <a href="http://www.irishsentencing.ie/en/ISIS/Pages/Home">Irish Sentencing
Information System website</a>.</p>

<h2>Factors to be considered by a judge in sentencing</h2>

<p>There are a number of important factors that a sentencing judge must have
regard to when sentencing you. It is a matter for your solicitor or barrister,
on your behalf, to urge the judge to consider these factors and what weight or
importance should be given to each.</p>

<h3>Facts surrounding the commission of the offence</h3>

<p>The circumstances in which the offence occurred might include: </p>
<ul><li>Provocation (were you provoked into committing the offence) </li>
  <li>Duress or emotional stress (were you under emotional pressure) </li>
  <li>Mistake </li>
  <li>Low value of goods stolen or damaged </li>
  <li>Recovery of stolen property </li>
</ul><p>These types of factors can have a positive effect for you in the judge’s
decision on sentencing and are known as mitigating factors. However, there may
also be factors which can have a negative effect (known as aggravating
factors). These include: </p>
<ul><li>Use of a firearm or other weapon </li>
  <li>Use of violence </li>
  <li>Invasion of someone’s home </li>
  <li>Breach of trust </li>
  <li>On bail for another offence at the time </li>
  <li>High value of goods stolen or damaged </li>
  <li>No stolen property recovered </li>
</ul><h3>Impact of the offence on the victim </h3>

<p>In most cases of a serious nature, a judge orders that a <a shape="rect" href="../../victims_of_crime/victims_and_the_probation_and_welfare_service.html">victim
impact report</a> be prepared. In some cases a judge hears direct evidence from
the victim through a <a href="http://www.victimsofcrimeoffice.ie/en/vco/English%20-%20Making%20a%20Victim%20Impact%20Statement.pdf/Files/English%20-%20Making%20a%20Victim%20Impact%20Statement.pdf">victim
impact statement (pdf)</a>. This has a bearing on the sentence which a judge
decides to impose.</p>

<h3>Offenders reaction to committing the offence </h3>

<p>You can expect a reduced sentence for pleading guilty. In many cases, a
guilty plea will save the court time and can be seen as a sign of remorse or
sorrow. In sex cases or cases involving violence, a guilty plea will spare the
victim the trauma of having to relive the events in court. </p>

<p>While a guilty plea is a mitigating factor, you are still entitled to fight
your case without it being seen as an aggravating factor. There is a
constitutional right to be tried in due course of law and nobody is penalised
for exercising this constitutional right. </p>

<h3>Early admission of guilt </h3>

<p>The court sees an early admission of guilt to the Gardaí as a mitigating
factor as it saves the Gardaí time and resources.</p>

<h3>Co-operation with the Gardaí </h3>

<p>Co-operation with the Gardaí also helps you in the sentencing process,
especially if it helped the Gardaí in catching other offenders. For example,
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1999/en/act/pub/0010/sec0005.html">Section
27 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 as amended</a> provides that this is a
factor to be taken into account in deciding whether the minimum 10 year
sentence for possession of drugs over a certain value is just and appropriate.
</p>

<h3>Personal circumstances of the offender </h3>

<p>Your personal circumstances is one of the most important factors a judge
considers prior to sentencing and may request a <a shape="rect" href="../../victims_of_crime/victims_and_the_probation_and_welfare_service.html">probation
report</a>. In considering your personal circumstances the judge takes the
following into account: </p>
<ul><li>Drug addiction </li>
  <li>Age </li>
  <li>Disability or illness </li>
  <li>Family Circumstances </li>
  <li>Other penalties as a result of conviction (for example, losing their job)
  </li>
  <li>Character (evidence may be given of your previous good character) </li>
  <li>Previous convictions</li>
</ul></div>

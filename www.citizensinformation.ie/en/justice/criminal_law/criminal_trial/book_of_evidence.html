<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>In a criminal trial the prosecution is obliged to disclose to the defence,
in advance of the trial, all relevant evidence which it has. If you are charged
with a criminal offence, you have the right to be provided with the evidence
the prosecution intends using at your trial, as well as the evidence which it
has but does not intend to use, if that evidence could assist your defence.</p>

<p>This duty to disclose is based on natural and constitutional justice, case
law and statutory principles. However, the duty differs between <a shape="rect" href="../criminal_offences/classification_of_crimes_in_criminal_cases.html">summary
prosecutions</a>, which are tried in the <a shape="rect" href="../../courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a> before a
judge without a jury, and prosecutions on indictment, which are tried before a
judge and jury in the <a shape="rect" href="../../courts_system/circuit_court.html">Circuit Court</a> or the <a shape="rect" href="../../courts_system/high_court_criminal_jurisdiction.html">Central
Criminal Court</a>.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l8f1d2">Summary prosecutions</h2>

<p>In a summary case there is no general duty for the prosecution to provide
you in advance with the statements of witnesses, whether or not you request
them. If you apply to the court to be provided with the statements, it is up to
the court to decide whether it is in the interest of justice to provide you
with them. The matters the court may need to consider were set out by the <a shape="rect" href="../../courts_system/supreme_court.html">Supreme Court</a> in
<em>Director of Public Prosecutions v Garry Doyle [1994] 2 IR 286</em>. </p>

<p>When deciding whether or not to release evidence, the prosecution must
consider similar principles. If you are requesting that you be provided with
the statements, the responsibility lies primarily with you or your <a shape="rect" href="../../courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a> to provide
adequate reasons for the disclosure. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l15bd3">Prosecutions on indictment</h2>

<p>In a case of trial on indictment the prosecution has a statutory duty to
provide you, in advance of your trial, with certain materials which sets out
the evidence intended to be given in the trial against you. These documents are
usually referred to as the <a shape="rect" href="book_of_evidence.html">Book of
Evidence</a>.</p>

<p>When the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dppireland.ie/">Director of Public
Prosecutions (DPP)</a> consents to you being sent forward for trial, the DPP
must serve the Book of Evidence on you (or your solicitor) within 42 days after
you first appear in the District Court. The DPP can apply to the District Court
to extend the 42 day period and normally the District Court will grant this
extension if:</p>
<ul><li>There is a good reason for doing so </li>
  <li>It would be in the interest of justice to do so </li>
</ul><p>The law does not set down any limit on the length of the extension. There
must, however, be a good reason for granting the extension, such as, if the <a shape="rect" href="../../law_enforcement/garda_siochana_national_police_force.html">Garda</a>
investigation is complex and there are a lot of witnesses involved in the case.
</p>

<p>If the District Court refuses to grant an extension of time for service of
the Book of Evidence, it must strike out the proceedings against you in
relation to the offence. This does not mean that the case is over or finished.
When the District Court strikes out the proceedings it is without prejudice to
the institution of any proceedings against you by the DPP. This means that the
DPP can bring you before the court again on the same charges.</p>

<p>If you intend relying on the evidence of any alibi at your trial you must
give notice of the alibi to the prosecution within 14 days of being served the
Book of Evidence.</p>

<h3>What does the Book of Evidence contain?</h3>

<p>The documents which must be served on you or your solicitor are as
follows:</p>
<ul><li>A statement of the charges against you </li>
  <li>A copy of any sworn information (in writing) upon which the proceedings
    were started, that is, the written complaint made by a Garda </li>
  <li>A list of the <a shape="rect" href="../../witnesses/witnesses_introduction.html">witnesses</a> whom the
    DPP proposes to call at the trial </li>
  <li>A statement of the evidence that is expected to be given by each witness
    at the trial </li>
  <li>A list of any exhibits to be introduced at the trial.</li>
</ul><p>Once the Book of Evidence is prepared, it is served on you. The serving of
the Book of Evidence does not mean that the DPP cannot serve additional
documents on you at a later stage. </p>

<p>At any time afterwards, the DPP must serve certain documents on you if they
exist. These additional documents include: </p>
<ul><li>A list of any further witnesses the DPP proposes to call at the trial
  </li>
  <li>A statement of the evidence that is expected to be given by each witness
    whose name appears on the list of further witnesses </li>
  <li>A statement of any further evidence that is expected to be given by any
    witness whose name appears on the earlier witness list </li>
  <li>A list of any further exhibits</li>
</ul><p>You have the right to inspect all exhibits mentioned in the list of
exhibits. </p>

<h3>Who compiles the Book of Evidence?</h3>

<p>While the Book of Evidence is compiled and served on behalf of the DPP, it
is normally the investigating Garda who is responsible for putting the Book of
Evidence together. Work on the Book of Evidence starts immediately after your
first appearance before the District Court. </p>

<p>As mentioned above, compiling a book of evidence can be a lengthy process
especially if the case is complex and there are a large number of witnesses.
Witness statements normally are the largest class of document included in a
Book of Evidence. Statements from Gardaí, witnesses to the crime and expert
witnesses (such as forensic experts and medical experts) are all gathered by
the investigating Garda for inclusion in the Book of Evidence.</p>

<h3>Is all the collected material disclosed?</h3>

<p>The prosecution may have other material which it has decided not to use at
your trial. Disclosure of this evidence should be made to you, without a
request, if the evidence is relevant to your defence.</p>

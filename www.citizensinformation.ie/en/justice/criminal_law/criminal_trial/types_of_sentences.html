<p>there is a wide range of sentences available to a judge who is <a shape="rect" href="sentence.html">sentencing someone found guilty of a criminal
offence</a> in Ireland. These sentences may be custodial or non-custodial and
include: </p>
<ul><li>Suspended sentences </li>
  <li>Community service orders </li>
  <li>Fines </li>
  <li>Curfews and exclusion orders </li>
</ul><p>Depending on the offence, secondary non-custodial options may be
appropriate, such as, disqualification, confiscation and compensation. There
are additional options for sex and drug trafficking offenders.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="le06e6">Imprisonment</h2>

<p>There are three specific types of imprisonment options available to a
judge:</p>

<p>• Mandatory sentences</p>

<p>• Maximum sentences</p>

<p>• Minimum sentences. </p>

<h3>Mandatory sentences</h3>

<p>A mandatory sentence is one which must be imposed regardless of any other
circumstances. In Ireland, murder carries a <strong>mandatory</strong> sentence
of life imprisonment. A life sentence lasts for life. As is the case in a
number of countries, however, not all of the life sentence in Ireland is
generally served in prison custody. The granting of temporary or early release
of life sentenced prisoners is a feature of prison systems internationally and
in Ireland. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/Our_ministers">Minister for Justice
and Equality</a>, in deciding on the release from prison of a life sentenced
prisoner, always considers the advice and recommendations of the <a shape="rect" href="../../prison_system/parole_board_of_ireland.html">Parole
Board of Ireland</a>. At present, the Board initially reviews prisoners who
have been sentenced to life imprisonment after they have served 7 years.</p>

<p>Prisoners serving very long sentences (including life sentences), are
normally reviewed on a number of occasions over a number of years before any
substantial concessions would be recommended by the Board. The final decision
as to whether a life sentenced prisoner is released, rests solely with the
Minister. The length of time spent in custody by offenders serving life
sentences can vary substantially. Of those prisoners serving life sentences who
have been released, the average sentence served in prison is approximately 12
years. This, however, is only an average; there are prisoners serving life
sentences in Ireland who have spent in excess of thirty years in custody. </p>

<h3>Maximum sentences </h3>

<p>The law lays down maximum sentences for all crimes. For example, if you are
found guilty of violent disorder under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0002/sec0015.html#zza2y1994s15">Section
15 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994</a>, the maximum sentence
you can receive is 10 years imprisonment. </p>

<p>The maximum sentence is used as a starting point by a judge when deciding on
what sentence to impose. </p>

<h3>Minimum sentences </h3>

<p>Generally, sentencing is left to the discretion of the judge. There are
however, are a number of laws which take this discretion away from the judge
and obliges the judge to impose <strong>at least</strong> a minimum sentence.
</p>

<p>If, for example, you are found guilty of possession of drugs with a value
greater than €13,000 under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1999/en/act/pub/0010/sec0004.html#partii-sec4">Section
15A of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977</a> , Section 27 of the Act as amended by
Section 33 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2007/a2907.pdf">Criminal
Justice Act 2007 (pdf)</a> provides for a minimum sentence of 10 years
imprisonment. Similarly, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2006/A2606.pdf">Criminal
Justice Act 2006 (pdf)</a> has introduced a number of new offences in relation
to firearms which carry a minimum sentence if you are <a shape="rect" href="criminal_trial.html">convicted on indictment</a>. If it is your first
offence, the judge has discretion to impose a lesser sentence, having regard to
such things as a guilty plea or assistance provided to the Gardaí. If,
however, it your second or subsequent drugs/firearms offence, then the minimum
sentence applies.</p>

<p>See "Further information" below on mandatory minimum sentences for firearm
offences<em>.</em></p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l79d3f">Non-custodial sentences </h2>

<h3>Suspended sentences</h3>

<p>A suspended sentence involves the judge imposing a prison sentence but
suspending it on certain conditions. This means that you do not go to prison if
you do not break the conditions. A suspended sentence contains 3 elements:</p>
<ul><li>The term of imprisonment (for example, 4 years) </li>
  <li>The conditions on which it is suspended (for example, to keep the peace
    and be of good behaviour or to undergo certain treatment) </li>
  <li>The period for which the sentence is suspended </li>
</ul><p>If you break a condition during the period for which the sentence is
suspended, you will have to serve the term of imprisonment originally
imposed.</p>

<h3>Community service orders </h3>

<p>Community service orders (CSOs) are provided for by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1983/en/act/pub/0023/index.html">Criminal
Justice (Community Service) Act 1983</a>. For your punishment, you are required
to do some work which is beneficial to the community. CSOs are imposed by a
judge instead of a prison sentence. </p>

<p>A number of considerations must be met before a CSO can be made by a judge:
</p>
<ul><li>You must be suitable for community service (The judge orders a <a shape="rect" href="../../victims_of_crime/victims_and_the_probation_and_welfare_service.html">probation
    report</a> to decide whether you are suitable for a CSO) </li>
  <li>Suitable community work must be available for you to do </li>
  <li>You must agree to the CSO </li>
</ul><p>The total number of hours of community service cannot exceed 240 hours and
you must complete the community service within one year of the making of the
order.</p>

<h3>Fines</h3>

<p>Many offences provide for a fine to be imposed. Often, offences will provide
for a fine and/or another punishment (usually a prison sentence), while other
offences attract only a fine. If a fine exceeds a certain amount (<a href="maximum_fines_on_summary_conviction.html">class A fine</a>) it may
take the offence outside the jurisdiction of the <a shape="rect" href="../../courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a> which can
only deal with minor offences.</p>

<p>When a fine is imposed, the judges normally specifies a period of time
within which you must pay the fine. If the fine is not paid within the time
provided by the judge, you can be sent to prison for a time in default of the
payment. In the District Court, the imprisonment default periods are as
follows:</p>

<p>
</p><table border="1" width="450" cellpadding="1" summary="District Court default periods in prison for not paying fines" cellspacing="1"><caption><strong>Default periods in prison for not paying
  fines</strong></caption>
  <thead><tr><td colspan="1" align="center" rowspan="1"><strong>Amount of
      Fine</strong></td>
      <td colspan="1" align="center" rowspan="1"><strong>Imprisonment in
        default</strong></td>
    </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Less than €64 </td>
      <td colspan="1" align="center" rowspan="1"><p dir="ltr">5 days</p>

    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Between €64 and €318 </td>
      <td colspan="1" align="center" rowspan="1">15 days </td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Between €318 and €635 </td>
      <td colspan="1" align="center" rowspan="1">45 days </td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Greater than €635 </td>
      <td colspan="1" align="center" rowspan="1">90 days </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><h3>Curfews and exclusion orders </h3>

<p>Judges sometimes use curfews and/or exclusion orders as a sentencing option.
Often, such an order takes the form of a condition of bail or of a suspended
sentence. </p>

<p>The court may make an order requiring you to be at home at a particular
address between certain hours of the day or night. Similarly, the judge might
ban you from entering a certain street or premises, for example, a pub or
licensed premises. </p>

<h3>Restriction on movement orders </h3>

<p>Under the Criminal Justice Act 2006 the court can impose restriction on
movement orders. This may be imposed if you are convicted of certain offences
(mainly public order and assault offences) and you are sentenced to
imprisonment of three months or more. The Act also provides that compliance
with such orders may be electronically monitored. However, this has not yet
been implemented. There is more information in the <a shape="rect" href="../../law_enforcement/restriction_on_movement_orders.html">document on
restriction on movement orders</a>. </p>

<h3>Probation orders </h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1907/act/17/enacted/en/html">Probation
of Offenders Act 1907</a> provides the courts with a way of dealing with first
time offenders and offenders who are unlikely to be in trouble again, by giving
them a type of official warning without imposing a sentence on them. If a
probation order is made, as well as requiring you to be of good behaviour, it
may also contain certain conditions such as:</p>
<ul><li>Payment of compensation </li>
  <li>Residing at a particular place </li>
  <li>Supervision </li>
  <li>Any other conditions considered necessary to prevent a repeat of the
    offence (for example, attending counselling) </li>
</ul><h3>Binding over </h3>

<p>In addition to the court’s power to make a probation order there is a long
standing power that allows the court to bind you over to keep the peace and be
of good behaviour. This involves you entering into a recognisance (or monetary
bond) for a period of time. If you get into trouble within the time stated in
the order, you must pay that sum of money or face imprisonment. </p>

<h3>The Poor Box </h3>

<p>The Court Poor Box is another way judges have of dealing with less serious
offences in the District Court. You may be required, if you agree, to pay a sum
of money into the Court Poor Box. Usually this is as an alternative to having a
conviction recorded against you. The option is only likely to be considered by
judges for first time offenders who have committed minor offences, such as,
littering or parking offences. This option is only available where you plead
guilty or where there are special circumstances explaining your behaviour.
There is more information in the <a shape="rect" href="court_poor_box.html">document on the Court Poor Box</a>. </p>

<h3>Forfeiture and confiscation </h3>

<p>Various laws provide judges with the power to order property, which is
connected with the offence you have been convicted of, to be forfeited or
confiscated. For example, under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1929/en/act/pub/0021/sec0010.html#zza21y1929s10">Section
10 of the Censorship of Publications Act 1929</a> prohibited publications may
be confiscated. </p>

<h3>Compensation </h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0006/index.html">Criminal
Justice Act 1993</a> gives judges the power, upon your conviction, to order you
to pay compensation. This may be in addition to or instead of any other
punishment. The amount of compensation which a court can order is limited to
the amount it could award in damages in a civil case. </p>

<p>
</p><table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" border="1" width="400" summary="District and Circuit Court compensation limits"><caption><strong>Court compensation limits</strong></caption>
  <thead><tr><td colspan="1" align="center" rowspan="1"><strong>Court</strong></td>
      <td colspan="1" align="center" rowspan="1"><strong>Maximum
        Compensation</strong> </td>
    </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">District Court </td>
      <td colspan="1" align="center" rowspan="1">€15,000 </td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Circuit Court </td>
      <td colspan="1" align="center" rowspan="1">€75,000 </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>The court must take your means and your financial commitments into account
when making a compensation order. Compensation orders may be enforced. For
example, the court can order an attachment of earnings. </p>

<h3>Disqualification</h3>

<p>Disqualification orders are not a punishment, but rather a finding that a
person is unfit to perform the function from which they are disqualified, for
example, drive a car. </p>

<p>The most common types of disqualifications are for convictions for driving
offences. However, under Part 7 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0033/index.html">Companies
Act 1990</a>, a person, convicted on indictment of a criminal offence related
to a company, can be disqualified from holding certain positions related to
running a company, such as a director. </p>

<h3>Endorsements and penalty points </h3>

<p>The Road Traffic Acts provide for a system of endorsements. An endorsement
is an entry on a person’s licence record of either a court order of
disqualification or of penalty points. There is more information in the <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/driving_offences/penalty_points_for_driving_offences.html">document
on penalty points</a>. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l967c3">Sex and drug trafficking offenders </h2>

<h3>Orders for sex offenders </h3>

<p>As well as the general sentencing options available for all offences, a
judge can make a number of specific orders when dealing with sexual offences.
This is provided for by the Sex Offenders Act 2001. </p>

<p>The following are the orders which a judge may make if you are a convicted
sex offender: </p>
<ul><li><strong>Notification order</strong>: It obliges you to notify the Gardaí
    of your name and address. </li>
  <li><strong>Certificate</strong>: It states that you have been convicted of
    the sexual offence, your sentence and that there is a notification
    requirement. </li>
  <li><strong>Obligation to notify employers</strong>: Where you are applying
    for employment which involves unsupervised access to or contact with a
    child or mentally impaired person, you are ordered to notify the employer
    or potential employer of your conviction for sex offences. </li>
  <li><strong>Sex offender order</strong>: Where the Court believes it is
    necessary to protect the public from you, it can make such an order
    prohibiting you from carrying out certain activities. </li>
</ul><p>There is more information in the documents on the <a shape="rect" href="sex_offenders_register.html">Sex Offenders Register</a> and on <a shape="rect" href="../../law_enforcement/monitoring_sex_offenders_in_ireland.html">monitoring
of sex offenders</a>. </p>

<h3>Orders for drug trafficking offenders</h3>

<p>The Criminal Justice Act 2006 introduced a system for convicted drug
traffickers similar to those mentioned for sex offenders. It allows the court
to make an order which obliges you to notify the Gardaí of your name and
address.</p>

<p>The order is only made by the court if it considers that it is in the
interest of the common good and that it is appropriate, given the circumstances
of your case. More information is available in the <a shape="rect" href="drug_offenders_register.html">document on the Drug Offenders
Register</a>. </p>

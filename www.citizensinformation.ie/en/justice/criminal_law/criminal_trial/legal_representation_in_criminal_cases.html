<p>There are two types of criminal offence; a summary offence, which can be
tried by a District Court judge sitting without a jury, and an indictable
offence, which is tried by a Circuit or High Court judge sitting with a
jury.</p>

<p>If you have been charged with a summary offence, you may be represented by a
<a href="../../courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a> and/or a <a href="../../courtroom/barristers.html">barrister</a>. <a shape="rect" href="../../legal_aid_and_advice/criminal_legal_aid.html">Criminal legal
aid</a> is not generally available at the District Court.</p>

<p>If you have been charged with an indictable offence, you will normally be
represented by a solicitor and a barrister (counsel). Usually, you will be
represented by a solicitor, a junior counsel and a senior counsel. </p>

<p>If you qualify for criminal legal aid, the state will cover the cost of your
lawyers.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you are the accused in a criminal trial, your defence counsel must behave
according to the following rules.</p>

<h3>Duties of the Defence Counsel</h3>

<p>The main duty of the defence counsel is to defend you whether or not they
think or believe you are guilty.</p>

<p>The defence counsel must always give a criminal case priority over all other
matters. </p>

<p>The defence counsel is under a duty to stay with you even if you are not
accepting their advice.</p>

<p>The defence counsel cannot withdraw from your case because of any conduct or
remarks made by the trial judge.</p>

<p>The defence counsel should be present throughout the trial at all times.
However, if, due to unforeseen circumstances, they have to leave, they must see
that you are not at any stage unrepresented and they must obtain the consent of
your solicitor to be absent.</p>

<p>Where there are two defence counsel, neither may leave the trial except
temporarily and for good reason.</p>

<p>The defence counsel must be properly briefed - that is, they must have
received all of the relevant information relating to your case at least one
week prior to the trial date.</p>

<p>The defence counsel also owes a duty to the court. they must not knowingly
state a lie in court. If you tell your barrister that you are guilty before the
start of the trial, they can continue to act for you if you plead
<em>guilty</em>. If you plead <em>not guilty</em>, they are very restricted as
to the type of defence they can mount on your behalf.</p>

<p>If you flee, your legal representation may withdraw from the case.</p>

<p>The decision whether or not to give evidence is your decision and not your
counsel's.</p>

<p>If you are convicted, the defence counsel has a duty to see you and to
appear for you in any appeal unless they has advised against the appeal.</p>

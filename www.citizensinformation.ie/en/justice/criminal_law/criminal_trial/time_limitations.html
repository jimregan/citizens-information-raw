<p>There are certain rules which apply to the maximum length of time allowed
between the date of an offence and the date by which the <a shape="rect" href="../../law_enforcement/garda_siochana_national_police_force.html">Gardaí</a>
must commence criminal proceedings. If such limits did not exist and you were
accused of an offence, you might have the offence hanging over you
indefinitely, not knowing if the Gardaí were going to prosecute you or not.

<h3>Summary offences</h3>

<p>In the case of a <a shape="rect" href="../criminal_offences/classification_of_crimes_in_criminal_cases.html">summary
offence</a> (an offence tried in the <a shape="rect" href="../../courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a> before a <a shape="rect" href="../../courtroom/judge.html">judge</a> without a <a shape="rect" href="../../courtroom/jury.html">jury</a>) the Gardaí must make a
complaint to the District Court within six months of the offence being
committed. These offences include most <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/driving_offences/driving_offences.html">Road
Traffic Offences</a> like speeding, illegal parking and fixed charge notice
offences. </p>

<h3>Indictable offences <br></h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1951/en/act/pub/0002/sec0007.html">Section
7 of the Criminal Justice Act 1951</a> (as amended by <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0026/sec0177.html">Section
177 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006</a>) states that the time limits that are
provided for summary offences do not apply to an <a shape="rect" href="../criminal_offences/classification_of_crimes_in_criminal_cases.html">indictable
offence</a> that can be tried summarily (an indictable offence is tried by a
judge and jury in the <a shape="rect" href="../../courts_system/circuit_court.html">Circuit Court</a> or the <a shape="rect" href="../../courts_system/high_court_criminal_jurisdiction.html">Central
Criminal Court</a>). Technically, therefore, there is no time limit for the
commencement of proceedings in the case of an indictable offence unless
specific legislation provides one.</p>

<p>However, if there is an excessively long delay in prosecuting an offence,
the judge may decide not to hear the case. In making the decision, the judge
considers whether the delay has reduced your chances of a fair trial, for
example, if the delay means that key <a shape="rect" href="../../witnesses/witnesses_introduction.html">witnesses</a> are no longer
available to give evidence or if the delay could have affected their memory of
what happened. </p>

<h3>Special time limits</h3>

<p>The general time limit of 6 months for commencing proceedings, mentioned
above, applies to most offences which are dealt with in the District Court.
There are however, some exceptions to this. Because of the nature and
difficulty of investigating some offences and of gathering enough evidence to
start proceedings, special time limits are applied to them by law. Examples of
these offences include the following: </p>
<ul><li>Under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts, An Post may institute proceedings for
    unlicensed TV sets at any time within 12 months from the date of the
    offence . </li>
  <li>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0018/sec0034.html#zza18y1992s34">Housing
    (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992</a> proceedings for an offence may be
    instituted within 2 years from the date of the offence. </li>
  <li>For offences under the Revenue Acts, proceedings may commence within 10
    years from the date of the offence. </li>
  <li>For offences under the Customs Acts, proceedings may commence within 3
    years from the date of the offence. </li>
</ul><h3>Calculating the time</h3>

<p>Normally, if you receive a summons and you seek legal advice, your solicitor
checks the dates on the summons to make sure that the summons was applied for
by the Garda within the time limit allowed. If the application was made outside
the time limit, then the prosecution will be struck down in court.</p>

<p>The crucial date is the date the Gardaí make the complaint to the District
Court judge or the date they make the application to the appropriate court
clerk for the issue of a <a shape="rect" href="summons.html">summons</a>,
rather than the date the summons was issued on or the date on which the summons
was served on you. </p>

<p>The other crucial date is the date the offence took place. In most cases
this is usually very clear, such as in a case of speeding or theft. </p>

<p>There are, however, certain offences which are slightly different. An
example of this would be where you are stopped by the Gardaí while driving on
1 January and you are asked for your motor insurance certificate. If you do not
produce it there and then, you have 10 days in which to produce it at a Garda
station of your choice. If you fail to produce it within 10 days then you have
committed an offence. The offence is not complete until <strong>after</strong>
the expiry of the 10 days and the date you were stopped does not count as one
of the 10 days. Therefore, in this case 12 January would be the crucial
date.</p>

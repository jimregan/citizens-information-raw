<p>In Ireland, instead of <a shape="rect" href="../../arrests/arrests.html">arresting you</a> to bring you to court to
answer a complaint, the <a shape="rect" href="../../law_enforcement/garda_siochana_national_police_force.html">Gardaí
(Irish police force)</a> may serve you with a summons ordering you to appear in
court on a particular date at a particular time. Summonses are issued by the <a shape="rect" href="../../courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a>
after a complaint has been made against you by a Garda (or someone else in a
private prosecution).</p>

<p>Usually, summonses are issued in less serious cases where it is not
considered necessary to arrest you to guarantee your appearance in court.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>There are three ways in which summonses can be issued in Ireland for minor
offences:</p>
<ul><li>Under Section 10 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1851/act/93/enacted/en/html">Petty
    Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851</a> </li>
  <li>Under an administrative process introduced by <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/31/section/49/enacted/en/html">Section
    1</a> of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1986/en/act/pub/0033/index.html">Courts
    (No. 3) Act 1986</a> </li>
  <li>Under the process for non-payment of <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/driving_offences/driving_offences.html">fixed
    charge fines</a> </li>
</ul><h3>Under the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851</h3>

<p>This is the process that is usually used in private prosecutions where, for
example, individuals are having difficulties with neighbours. It is rarely used
by the Gardaí.</p>

<p>The complainant goes before a District Court judge and makes the complaint
either orally or in writing, with or without an oath, as the judge decides.</p>

<p>The information the complainant provides should contain brief particulars
of:</p>
<ul><li>Name and address of the alleged offender </li>
  <li>Name and address of the complaintant </li>
  <li>The basic facts of the alleged offence, including when it is alleged to
    have been committed </li>
  <li>If possible the piece of legislation which applies to the offence</li>
</ul><p>When the information has been put before the judge, he/she must decide
whether it justifies a summons. If the judge issues a summons it will require
the alleged offender to appear at a sitting of the court.</p>

<h3>Under the Courts (No. 3) Act 1986</h3>

<p>The administrative process under the Courts (No. 3) Act 1986 is the
procedure usually used by the Gardaí and allows for summonses to be issued by
the office of the District Court. This is an administrative process where
applications can be made on behalf of the Attorney General, the Director of
Public Prosecutions, a member of the Garda Siochana or any other person
statutorily authorised to prosecute offences. </p>

<h3>The summons</h3>

<p>A summons <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/53bd32841fc5bbf280256d2b0045bb5d/7ced286cd9c9b12a8025764f005944f9?OpenDocument">issued
under the 1851 Act</a> or <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/53bd32841fc5bbf280256d2b0045bb5d/86a852378d13c3658025764f00594509?OpenDocument">issued
under the 1986 Act</a> must contain the following: </p>
<ul><li>The name of the complaintant or prosecutor (for example, a Garda’s
    name) </li>
  <li>The name and address of the person against whom the complaint is made
  </li>
  <li>Details, in ordinary language, of the alleged offence including the time,
    date and place of the alleged offence </li>
  <li>The date, time and venue of the court </li>
  <li>The judge's signature if issued by a judge or the name of the District
    Court clerk</li>
</ul><p>Where the summons is issued under the 1986 Act the summons also contains:
</p>
<ul><li>An outline of the law that is alleged to have been broken </li>
  <li>The date on which the summons was applied for </li>
</ul><p>This final one is most important in relation to the <a shape="rect" href="time_limitations.html">time limits for commencement of criminal
proceedings</a>. This date will indicate if the summons was applied for within
the legal time limit for instituting proceedings. </p>

<h3>For non-payment of fixed charge fines </h3>

<p>When you are issued with a fixed charge notice for a road traffic offence
and you fail to pay the fine within the time allowed, a summons is
automatically issued and sent to you by ordinary post. This process does not
require a Garda to apply for the summons to be issued, because the summons is
triggered by non-payment of the fixed charge fine.</p>

<h3>Service of the summons</h3>

<p>The rules which govern the service of summonses are to be found in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/0c609d7abff72c1c80256d2b0045bb64/232ac051a1832bfe80257c900044b452?OpenDocument">Rules
of the District Court (Order 10)</a>. Basically a summons can be served on you
in the following ways:</p>
<ul><li>Personal delivery: by handing a copy of the summons to you or by leaving
    it at your last known abode or your place of work, or with your spouse,
    child or other relative. </li>
  <li>Postal delivery: by registered post to your last or most usual place of
    abode or to your place of business or employment. </li>
</ul><p>Where service is affected by personal delivery, the summons must be served
at least 7 days before the date fixed for your court case. In the case of
registered post, the period is 21 days.</p>

<p>If a summons has not been correctly served, you are not obliged to appear in
court in response to it. However, if you are present in court, there is no
reason why the proceedings against you cannot proceed. In other words, any
defect in the service of the summons is corrected by your appearance in court.
</p>

<h3>Defects or errors on the summons </h3>

<p>It is rare that a court dismisses a case on the basis of an error or
omission in a summons. Discrepancies or differences, between the facts on the
summons and the facts presented to the court by the prosecuting Garda
concerning time and place of the incident, does not normally prevent the
prosecution of the case. In fact, the District Court has discretion to amend a
defective summons under <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/0c609d7abff72c1c80256d2b0045bb64/d77fd0a1ce7bec2880256d2b0046a066?OpenDocument">Rule
38 of the Distric Court Rules</a>. </p>

<p>However, a fundamental defect on the face of the summons such as the
omission of the location of the District Court, or the identity of the District
Court Clerk to whom the complaint was made, is fatal to the proceedings. </p>

<h3>Adjournments</h3>

<p>If you do not appear in court on the date stated in the summons, the
District Court may either: </p>
<ul><li>Go ahead with the hearing in your absence or </li>
  <li>Decide to adjourn the matter. You will be notified of the new date for
    the hearing </li>
</ul><p>If, on the adjourned date, you have still failed to appear in court and the
judge is satisfied you were given reasonable notice of the adjourned hearing,
the court may </p>
<ul><li>Issue a warrant for your arrest to bring you to court or </li>
  <li>Go ahead with the hearing in your absence</li>
</ul></div>

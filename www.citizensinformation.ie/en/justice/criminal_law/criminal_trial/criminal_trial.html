<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>There are <a href="../criminal_offences/classification_of_crimes_in_criminal_cases.html">two
types of criminal offences</a>:</p>
<ul><li>Summary offences, that is, offences that are tried by a <a href="../../courtroom/judge.html">judge</a> sitting alone </li>
  <li>Indictable offences, that is, offences that can be tried by a judge and
    <a href="../../courtroom/jury.html">jury</a> </li>
</ul><p>Certain indictable offences may be tried summarily.</p>

<p>If you are accused of a criminal offence, you may qualify for <a shape="rect" href="../../legal_aid_and_advice/criminal_legal_aid.html">criminal
legal aid</a>, which provides free <a shape="rect" href="legal_representation_in_criminal_cases.html">legal representation in
criminal cases</a>.</p>

<p>There are two types of trial:</p>
<ul><li>A summary trial - a trial conducted by a judge sitting alone</li>
  <li>Trial by jury - a trial conducted by a judge sitting with a jury</li>
</ul><p>Summary trials are heard in the <a href="../../courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a>. If you
are charged with an indictable offence, the District Court Judge will send you
forward to the <a href="../../courts_system/circuit_court.html">Circuit
Court</a> or the <a href="../../courts_system/high_court.html">Central
Criminal Court (High Court)</a> for trial by jury providing the <a href="http://www.dppireland.ie/">Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP)</a>
consents to it. The court that will hear and decide on your case depends on the
type of offence involved.</p>

<p>Before the actual trial takes place, there are a number of issues that come
up including the <a href="disclosure_in_criminal_cases.html">disclosure of
evidence</a> and the option of pleading guilty. </p>

<p>After the trial, there is <a shape="rect" href="sentence.html">sentencing</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="ldf8be">Pleading guilty</h2>

<p>At any stage in criminal proceedings against you in court, you may decide to
plead guilty to the offence.</p>

<h3>Summary Offences</h3>

<p>If you are charged with a summary offence you plead guilty in the District
Court.</p>

<p>The District Court Judge will then issue your sentence after listening to
your legal representative and the prosecution (usually a member of An Garda
Siochana - the Irish police force).</p>

<h3>Indictable Offences</h3>

<p>If you are charged with an indictable offence and you decide to plead guilty
when you appear in the District Court, you will be required to sign <em>pleas
of guilt</em>. </p>

<p>Before you sign the pleas of guilt, the District Judge will first make sure
that you are aware of the facts alleged against you and that you understand the
nature of the offence.</p>

<p>You will then be sent forward to the Circuit Court for sentencing. If you
change your mind, you may withdraw your pleas of guilt at the Circuit Court and
the trial will go ahead. </p>

<p>If you have pleaded not guilty in the District Court and you have been sent
forward for trial by a judge and jury, you may then decide to plead guilty to
the offence. If you plead guilty at the Circuit Court, you will stand convicted
and the court will then decide your sentence. </p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="laf341">Summary trial</h2>

<p>If you are charged with a summary offence, a judge sitting without a jury
will decide your case. It will take place in the District Court. A summary
trial will usually take the following format</p>
<ul><li>The <a shape="rect" href="../../courtroom/court_registrar.html">Registrar</a> of the District
    Court will call your case by its name.</li>
  <li>You or your legal representative will stand up to make yourself known to
    the court.</li>
  <li>The Garda (member of the Irish police force) who has made the complaint
    against you will take the witness stand and give evidence about the offence
    - i.e., what happened.</li>
  <li>The defence may cross-examine the Garda.</li>
  <li>The prosecution may call any more witnesses and will question the
    witnesses to allow them to give evidence about the offence.</li>
  <li>The defence may cross-examine each of the prosecution witnesses after
    they have given evidence.</li>
  <li>The defence may call and question witnesses to give evidence in your
    defence. You yourself may give evidence although you are not obliged to do
    so.</li>
  <li>The prosecution may cross-examine each of your witnesses.</li>
  <li>Both the prosecution and the defence may make final submissions relating
    to the case.</li>
  <li>The judge will make their decision about whether you are guilty or not
    guilty of the offence, based on the evidence given. To find you guilty,
    they must believe that it has been proven beyond all reasonable doubt that
    you are guilty.</li>
  <li>If the judge finds that you are guilty of the offence, they may decide
    the sentence. </li>
</ul><p>If the judge finds that you are not guilty, they will dismiss the charges
against you.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l688bb">Trial by jury</h2>

<p>Criminal jury trials are held in the Circuit Court and the Central Criminal
Court and usually follow the following format:</p>
<ul><li>The indictment is read out, which lists the offences (counts) to which
    you have pleaded not guilty.</li>
  <li>The opening speech of the trial is made by the prosecution. The
    prosecution counsel opens the case and tells the jury about matters that
    the prosecution intends to prove. Counsel gives an outline of the facts and
    evidence that the prosecution intends to call. They explain the nature of
    the charges alleged against the accused.</li>
  <li>After the opening address to the jury, the prosecution calls witnesses,
    usually in the order listed in the <a href="disclosure_in_criminal_cases.html">Book of Evidence</a>. Counsel
    asks the witnesses questions to allow them to tell their story and give
    their evidence in their own words. Documents and statements may be
    introduced. Forensic evidence may be introduced as exhibits and the jury is
    usually given an opportunity to examine such exhibits.</li>
  <li>When the prosecuting counsel has finished asking each witness questions,
    the defence counsel may <em>cross-examine</em> the witness. If the defence
    intends to challenge a prosecution witness's evidence, the defence counsel
    must explain the basis for the challenge to the witness.</li>
  <li>When the prosecuting counsel has finished presenting the case for the
    prosecution, the defence begins. The defence counsel opens the defence and
    calls witnesses and introduces evidence. Each witness may be cross-examined
    by the prosecution. As you are the accused you are not obliged to give
    evidence.</li>
  <li>At the end of the case, both the prosecution and the defence counsel
    summarise the facts for the jury and emphasise the merits of their own
  case.</li>
  <li>At the end of the trial, the judge sums up the case for the jury. They
    explain the jury's function and directs the jury to confine itself to the
    evidence presented in court and to disregard any media reports. </li>
  <li>The judge must direct the jury on any legal points that arise. For
    example, they may explain the legal ingredients of the offence of murder so
    that the jury can arrive at a verdict that conforms to that legal rule.</li>
  <li>As the case is a criminal one, the judge will also explain to the jury
    that it must be satisfied of your guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Beyond
    reasonable doubt means that if there are two reasons given in the case and
    both are possible explanations for what happened, taken together with the
    evidence presented, the jury should give you the benefit of the doubt. (If
    the case was a civil one, the judge would explain to the jury that it must
    be satisfied of its verdict on the balance of probabilities.)</li>

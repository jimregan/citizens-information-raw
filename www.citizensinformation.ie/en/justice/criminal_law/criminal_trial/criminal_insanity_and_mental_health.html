<h2>Information</h2>

<p>People who are charged with a criminal offence and who are suffering from a
mental disorder are dealt with under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2006/act/11/enacted/en/html">Criminal
Law (Insanity) Act 2006</a> as amended by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2010/en/act/pub/0040/index.html">Criminal
Law (Insanity) Act 2010</a>. </p>

<p>The question of the mental state of someone charged with a crime may arise
at 2 different stages - at the start of the trial and at the decision on guilt.
If a person is suffering from a mental disorder, they may be considered unfit
to be tried at the start of the trial. In that case, no trial goes ahead. If a
trial is held and the person is considered to have actually committed the
offence but was insane at the time, it is possible for a verdict of not guilty
by reason of insanity to be reached. In murder cases, the concept of diminished
responsibility may be used to substitute a verdict of manslaughter.</p>

<p>A mental disorder is defined in the 2006 Act as including mental illness,
mental disability, dementia or any disease of the mind but does not include
intoxication (drunkenness).<br></p>

<h3>Fit or unfit to be tried<br></h3>

<p>The decision on whether or not a person is fit to be tried is made by a
judge. If the person cannot understand the charge or is unable to instruct a
legal team, challenge jurors or follow the evidence, then they may be
considered unfit to be tried.</p>

<p>This finding (that is that someone is considered unfit to be tried) is not a
decision on the alleged criminal activity. If someone is found to be unfit to
be tried, then the trial is postponed. The judge then decides what happens
next. For example, the person may be committed to a psychiatric hospital or
unit if they are considered to be suffering from a mental disorder and are in
need of in-patient treatment under the terms of the Mental Health Act, 2001.
Alternatively, the person may be sent for out-patient psychiatric care. The
person may be committed to a psychiatric hospital or unit for 14 days in order
to establish whether or not they should be sent for treatment. The person may
appeal against a committal order.</p>

<p>If the judge considers that there is a reasonable doubt that the person
committed the alleged crime, the person may be acquitted. The Director of
Public Prosecutions may appeal against a decision that a person is unfit to be
tried. <br></p>

<h3>Not guilty by reason of insanity<br></h3>

<p>If someone is considered to have actually committed the offence but was
insane at the time, the verdict may be not guilty by reason of insanity. This
decision is made by a jury. If this verdict is reached, the judge may order
that the person be committed to a psychiatric hospital or unit in broadly the
same way as applies in the case of being unfit to be tried. </p>

<h3>Diminished responsibility in murder cases<br></h3>

<p>If someone is charged with murder, the verdict of not guilty by reason of
insanity is one possible verdict. The Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 provides
for the concept of diminished responsibility in murder cases. A conviction for
murder brings an automatic life sentence. In other crimes, the judge has
discretion in relation to sentencing and so can take into account any
diminished responsibility which may exist. If someone charged with murder
successfully pleads diminished responsibility, then the verdict is
manslaughter. The judge can then sentence the person to any length of time in
prison.<br></p>

<h3>Mental Health Review Board</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mhclrb.ie/index.php">Mental Health (Criminal Law)
Review Board's</a> main function is to review the detention of those found not
guilty by reason of insanity or unfit to be tried, who have been detained in a
designated centre by order of a court. At present, the only designated centre
is the Central Mental Hospital. The Review Board also has responsibility for
people who have been convicted of offences and who become mentally ill while
serving their sentences. The Review Board must have regard to the welfare and
safety of the person whose detention it reviews and to the public interest. It
may assign a legal representative to the person unless the person proposes to
engage one.</p>

<p>The Board is composed of a legal chairperson and a number of other people,
at least one of whom must be a consultant psychiatrist. It is obliged to review
each detention at least once every 6 months.

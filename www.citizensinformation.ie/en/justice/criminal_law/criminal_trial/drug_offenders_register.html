<p>Part 9 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0026/index.html">Criminal
Justice Act 2006</a> came into force in October 2006 and introduced new
obligations on those who have been convicted of <a shape="rect" href="../criminal_offences/drug_offences.html">drug trafficking offences</a> to
notify Gardaí of certain information about themselves. This provision is based
on the same principle as the <a shape="rect" href="sex_offenders_register.html">Sex Offenders Register</a> and enables the
movements of convicted drug dealers to be recorded in a similar fashion.
Furthermore, the Register assists the Gardaí in monitoring illegal activity
and provides useful intelligence on convicted offenders.</p>

<p>This document sets out the duties of offenders to notify the Gardaí.
Information on penalties for those who fail to comply is also provided.</p>

<h3>How soon after conviction must I notify Gardaí?</h3>

<p>If you are convicted of a drug trafficking offence you are required to
notify the Gardaí of certain information about yourself within 7 days. When
you receive a term of imprisonment following a drug conviction, your duty to
notify the Gardaí doesn’t begin until after you are released from prison.
You then have 7 days from the date of release to notify the Gardaí. The
Governor of the prison is obliged to notify the Gardaí at least 10 days before
your release that you are going to be released. </p>

<h3>What information am I required to give the Gardaí?</h3>

<p>When an order is made by a court requiring you to notify Gardaí you are
obliged to supply the following information in order to comply with the
requirements:</p>
<ul><li>Your name and if you use another name(s), each of those names </li>
  <li>Your home address </li>
  <li>If you change your name from the one previously given to the Gardaí then
    you must provide that new name within 7 days of any such change of name
  </li>
  <li>Any change of your home address </li>
  <li>If you intend to leave the state for a continuous period of 7 days or
    more then you must notify the Gardaí of your intention and of where they
    intend to stay while outside the state </li>
  <li>Your date of birth </li>
</ul><h3>How long do the requirements to notify the Gardaí last for?</h3>

<p>It depends on the length of sentence you receive from the court. The longer
the sentence, the longer the requirements last. The following is a guide to the
length of time the requirements last: </p>
<ul><li>12 years: if you were imprisoned for life (life normally meaning 14 years
    or less in prison) </li>
  <li>7 years: if you were imprisoned more than 10 years (but not imprisonment
    for life) </li>
  <li>5 years: if you were imprisoned for more than 5 years (but not more than
    10 years) </li>
  <li>3 years: if you were imprisoned for more than one year (but not more than
    5 years) </li>
  <li>1 year: if your imprisonment is suspended by the court </li>
</ul><h3>Do offenders under 18 also have to notify the Gardaí?</h3>

<p>Yes, those under 18 years at time of sentencing are also obliged to notify
the Gardaí – but the periods are shorter. They are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>6 years: if you were imprisoned for life, (life normally meaning 14 years
    or less in prison) </li>
  <li>3.5 years: if you were imprisoned more than 10 years (but not
    imprisonment for life) </li>
  <li>2.5 years: if you were imprisoned for more than 5 years (but not more
    than 10 years) </li>
  <li>1.5 years: if you were imprisoned for more than one year (but not more
    than 5 years) </li>
  <li>Six months: if your imprisonment is suspended by the court </li>
</ul><h3>Can I apply to have the notification requirements cancelled?</h3>

<p>Yes. Anyone subject to the requirements for a period of 12 years (or 6 years
in the case of someone under 18 years of age) can apply to the court for an
order discharging them from having to notify the Gardaí on the grounds that
the interests of the common good is not being served by you being obliged to
continue to notify. You should apply to the court which imposed the prison
sentence originally. The application may be made by you or by a <a shape="rect" href="../../courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a> on your behalf. Court
staff will assist in making the application if you have any difficulties. There
is no charge for an application. </p>

<p>Anyone applying to the court is allowed to bring forward any witness to the
court who will give evidence on their behalf or in regard to their character,
for example, a doctor who had treated you or the director of a drugs
rehabilitation programme which you attended.</p>

<p>If you intend to apply to the court for a discharge of the requirements to
report to the Gardaí, you must notify the Superintendent of the local Garda
station of your intention to make an application to the court. </p>

<h3>How soon can I apply to the court?</h3>

<p>People who are subject to the Garda notification requirements for a period
of 12 years can’t apply to the court for a discharge until 8 years have
passed. This means that you must comply with the requirement of reporting to
the Gardaí for at least 8 years. Similarly anyone under the age of 18 years at
the time of sentence who is subject to the notification requirements for 6
years must remain subject to these requirements for 4 years before they can
apply to the court for a discharge of the order.</p>

<h3>What happens when someone fails to comply with the notification
requirements?</h3>

<p>Anyone who fails (without reasonable excuse), to comply with the
notification requirement is guilty of an offence. The penalty is a fine of up
to €3,000 or imprisonment for up to 12 months, or both. </p>

<h3>Do these notification requirements apply to persons convicted outside the
state?</h3>

<p>Yes they do. If you are convicted of a drug trafficking offence outside
Ireland where that offence would constitute a drug trafficking offence in
Ireland, you are subject to the same Garda notification requirements if you
subsequently come to live in Ireland. If you fail to notify the Gardaí of your
details, then the Gardaí can prosecute you for non-compliance or failure to
comply with the requirements. The Gardaí, however, have to produce a document
to the court proving the particulars of your conviction abroad.</p>

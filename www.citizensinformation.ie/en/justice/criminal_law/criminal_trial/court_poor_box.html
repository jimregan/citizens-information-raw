<p>Sometimes in criminal prosecutions heard in lower courts, the <a shape="rect" href="../../courtroom/judge.html">judge</a> may order the
defendant to place a donation in the court poor box in lieu of conviction. In
other words, instead of being convicted and facing imprisonment or a statutory
fine, the judge can order that the defendant donate a sum to a charity
nominated by the judge. This sum of money is then lodged by the defendant with
the court and paid over by the Fines Office of the Court to the charity in
question.</p>

<p>There is no apparent law in place that gives the judge this discretion. The
use of the court poor box, however, is a process that has evolved over the
years. It appears to stem from the judge's common law jurisdiction to exercise
his or her discretion in imposing penalties and/or other conditions. In
particular, this process often occurs in the lower courts (i.e., the <a shape="rect" href="../../courts_system/district_court_criminal_juris.html">District
Court</a>). </p>

<p>In 2005 the <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/">Law Reform Commission</a>
published their <a shape="rect" href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/Reports/rCourtPoorBox.pdf">Report on
the court poor box: probation of offenders (pdf)</a>. In February 2014 the
Department of Justice and Equality published the <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR14000035">General Scheme of
Criminal Justice (Community Sanctions) Bill</a> which proposes to replace the
poor box with a statutory Reparation Fund. </p>

<p>Until new legislation is introduced however, the following information
describes the current situation with regard to the court poor box. </p>

<p>The most common reason for making a decision such as this is that, in the
opinion of the judge, while the prosecution has proven its case, it is not
appropriate to enter a conviction. For example, the judge may anticipate that
the defendant will not commit any other offence. </p>

<p>For example, on the one hand, it could be argued that the prospect of
appearing in court is a significant deterrent from crime for some citizens. The
fact that details of their personal lives and activities may become public
knowledge can sometimes be enough to deter them from committing a crime again.
In addition, having a conviction registered against you can significantly
affect your life (i.e., employment prospects, career, business and social
relationships, etc.). For this reason, where the court feels that the citizen
will not re-offend, the judge can choose to impose a donation to the court poor
box. </p>

<p>On the other hand, however, concerns have been expressed in Ireland as to
the need to ensure equal treatment for offenders from different economic
backgrounds. There is also a significant question as to the lack of
accountability regarding the use of funds. For example, some people feel that
having a court poor box is a way out of conviction for some citizens who can
afford to pay the fine. Other individuals who cannot afford the fine may have
no option but to have their conviction registered against them. There are also
concerns that donations to the court poor box deprives the Irish Government of
fines that should in ordinary circumstances be imposed. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>There is currently no specific law governing court poor boxes. Where an
accused makes a payment to the poor box, the judge usually applies the
Probation of Offenders Act 1908 or imposes a suspended sentence. </p>

<p>It is intended to reform the current court poor box system. Until <span>new
legislation</span> is <span>in place</span>, the <span>court poor box</span>
system is <span>still in force</span>.</p>

<p>Donations to the court poor box imposed by a judge can vary in amount,
depending on the offence. </p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If a judge orders that you make a donation to the court poor box and you
have the funds to pay, the <a shape="rect" href="../../courtroom/court_registrar.html">Court Registrar</a> in court on the
day will collect the payment and issue you with a receipt. If you do not have
the funds with you on the day but can afford to pay, your case may be adjourned
for a period (i.e., a month, three months, etc.). You are then recalled to
court and you pay the donation. Donations are then forwarded to the relevant
charity/organisation by the court. If you do not have the funds to pay or you
choose not to make a donation, a conviction for your offence will be registered
against you. </p>

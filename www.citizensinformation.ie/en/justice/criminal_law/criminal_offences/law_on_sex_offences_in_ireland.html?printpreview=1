<p>A range of sexual offences in Ireland are prohibited by law. The following
information sets out the most important of those offences. The precise charge
for these offences depends on all the circumstances of the case, the age of the
victim and the evidence available. The current penalties for sex offences in
Ireland include:</p>
<ul><li>Imprisonment </li>
  <li>Fines </li>
  <li>Being placed on the Sex Offenders Register </li>
  <li>Sex Offenders Orders </li>
  <li>Post release supervision. </li>
</ul><p>Sex offenders must tell certain prospective employers in Ireland that they
have been convicted of such offences. Further information on this duty is set
out in our document on <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/monitoring_and_surveillance_at_work/garda_clearance_for_employees.html">Garda
clearance for employees</a>. </p>

<h3>Rape</h3>

<p>The crime of rape may be charged under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1981/en/act/pub/0010/index.html">Criminal
Law (Rape) Act 1981</a> or the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0032/index.html">Criminal
Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act 1990</a>. The circumstances of the case, age of the
victim and evidence will decide which legislation will apply.</p>

<p>The maximum penalty in Ireland for a rape offence is life imprisonment.
There are related offences under the law of attempted rape, and separately of
aiding and abetting a rape. (That is, assisting another person to commit a
rape). </p>

<h3>Sexual Assault/Aggravated sexual assault</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0032/sec0002.html#zza32y1990s2">Section
2 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act 1990</a> sets out the law in
Ireland on sexual assault. A sexual assault is an indecent assault on a male or
a female. The maximum sentence is 10 years imprisonment or 14 years if the
victim is aged under 17 years. </p>

<p>Aggravated sexual assault is sexual assault involving serious violence or
the threat of serious violence. In common with rape offences, the maximum
sentence for aggravated sexual assault is life imprisonment. </p>

<h3>Sexual offences relating to children</h3>

<p>There is no specific offence in law of <span>child sex abuse</span>. A
person may be charged with rape, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault or
with one of the specific offences relating to children. The law in this area
changed significantly in 2006 – further information is set out below.</p>

<h3>Statutory rape</h3>

<p>The term <span>statutory rape</span> is not used in the legislation but it
is the term that is commonly used for unlawful sexual contact with a person
aged under 17 years. Until June 2006, charges for this offence were brought
under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1935/en/act/pub/0006/index.html">Criminal
Law (Amendment) Act 1935</a>. In the case of CC v Ireland, the Attorney General
and the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Supreme Court held that <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1935/en/act/pub/0006/sec0001.html#zza6y1935s1">Section
1 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 1935 Act</a> was unconstitutional. <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/unconstitutional_legislation_and_decisions.html">Read
more about what happens when law is found to be unconstitutional here</a>. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.courts.ie/judgments.nsf/09859e7a3f34669680256ef3004a27de/877f6b6773b3dcee80257177003c6586?OpenDocument">View
the judgement of the Supreme Court in the case of CC v Ireland here</a>.</p>

<p>The effect of the Supreme Court decision is that Section 1 of the 1935 Act
is no longer a part of the Act. The rest of the Act was not affected. A new
Act, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2006/a1506.pdf">Criminal
Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 (pdf)</a> was passed to replace the
unconstitutional provisions in the 1935 Act. It also repealed and replaced
Section 2 of the 1935 Act. The original 1935 Act has now been amended many
times.</p>

<h3>Defilement of a child aged under 15 years</h3>

<p>The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 makes it a criminal offence to
engage or attempt to engage in a sexual act with a child under the age of 15
years. This is what is meant by the term ‘<span>defilement</span>’. The
maximum sentence for this offence is life imprisonment. </p>

<p>A sexual act for the purposes of the law includes sexual intercourse and
buggery between people who are not married to each other and any sexual act
which could constitute aggravated sexual assault.</p>

<p>The 2006 Act provides that the accused may argue they honestly believed the
child was aged 15 years or over. The court must then consider whether or not
that belief was reasonable. It is not a defence to show that the child
consented to the sexual act.</p>

<h3>Defilement of a child aged under 17 years</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2006/a1506.pdf">Section 3
of the Criminal Law (Sex Offences) Act 2006 (pdf)</a> as amended by <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2007/a607.pdf">Section 5
of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Act 2007 (pdf)</a> makes it a
criminal offence to engage or attempt to engage in a sexual act with a child
under 17 years. The maximum sentence is five years, ten years if the accused is
a person in authority. A person in authority means:</p>
<ul><li>A parent, step-parent, guardian, grandparent, uncle or aunt of the
    victim, or </li>
  <li>any person acting in loco parentis (in place of parent or parents) to the
    victim, or </li>
  <li>any person responsible for the education, supervision or welfare of the
    victim. </li>
</ul><p>The maximum sentence is greater for a second or subsequent offence.</p>

<p>The accused may argue that he or she honestly believed that the child was
aged 17 years or over. The court must then consider whether or not that belief
was reasonable. It is not a defence to show that the child consented to the
sexual act.</p>

<p>The consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions is required for any
prosecution of a child under the age of 17 years for this offence. A person who
is convicted of this offence and is not more than two years older than the
victim is not subject to the requirements of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0018/index.html">Sex
Offenders Act 2001</a>. This means they will not have their name placed on the
Sex Offenders Register.</p>

<p>A girl aged under 17 years who has sexual intercourse may not be convicted
of an offence on that ground alone.</p>

<h3>Reckless endangerment of children</h3>

<p>The Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides for a new offence of reckless
endangerment of children. This came into effect on 1 August 2006. </p>

<p>This offence may be committed by a person who has authority or control over
a child or an abuser and who intentionally or recklessly endangers a child
by:</p>
<ul><li>Causing or permitting any child to be placed or left in a situation which
    creates a substantial risk to the child of being a victim of serious harm
    or sexual abuse or </li>
  <li>failing to take reasonable steps to protect a child from such a risk
    while knowing that the child is in such a situation. </li>
</ul><p>This offence may be prosecuted only by the Director of Public Prosecutions.
The penalty is a fine (no upper limit) and/or a maximum of 10 years
imprisonment.</p>

<h3>Incest</h3>

<p>The term incest refers to sexual intercourse occurring between close
relatives. Close relatives include a child, a sibling or a parent. This is a
criminal offence and charges are brought under the Punishment of Incest Act
1908 as amended by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0012/index.html">Criminal
Law (Incest Proceedings) Act 1995</a>.</p>

<p>There are no age limits. However, a girl under 17 years cannot be prosecuted
for incest. The maximum sentence is life imprisonment for males and seven years
for females. </p>

<h3>Sexual Offences involving people with disabilities</h3>

<p>There are specific provisions in Ireland for sexual offences involving
people with disabilities. A person who engages in unlawful sexual activity with
a person with a disability may, of course, be charged under any of the
provisions described above. The specific provisions for people with
disabilities are contained in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0020/sec0005.html#zza20y1993s5">Section
5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993</a>.</p>

<p>This provides for the following specific offences:</p>
<ul><li>Sexual intercourse or buggery with a mentally impaired person (other than
    a spouse); the maximum penalty is ten years imprisonment </li>

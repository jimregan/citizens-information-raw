<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>A crime is defined in law in Ireland as an act which may be punished by the
State. The way in which a criminal offence is investigated and prosecuted
depends on the type of crime involved. For these purposes criminal offences may
be described in different ways such as:</p>
<ul><li>Summary offences </li>
  <li>Indictable offences </li>
  <li>Minor offences </li>
  <li>Serious offences </li>
  <li>Arrestable offences </li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l689a5">Summary and indictable offences</h2>

<p>There are two ways <a shape="rect" href="../criminal_trial/criminal_trial.html">criminal offences can be tried</a>
in Irish law:</p>
<ul><li>In the lower court (<a shape="rect" href="../../courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a>) before a
    <a shape="rect" href="../../courtroom/judge.html">judge</a> without a <a shape="rect" href="../../courtroom/jury.html">jury</a> </li>
  <li>In the higher courts (<a shape="rect" href="../../courts_system/circuit_court.html">Circuit Criminal Court</a>,
    <a shape="rect" href="../../courts_system/high_court.html">Central Criminal
    Court</a>) before a judge and jury </li>
</ul><p>Summary and indictable offences indicate the manner in which these offences
are tried or dealt with in the courts. A summary offence is one which can only
be dealt with by a judge sitting without a jury,that is the District Court,
while an indictable offence is one which may be or must be tried before a judge
and jury.</p>

<p>All common-law offences are held to be indictable offences as the common law
did not distinguish or differentiate between indictable and non-indictable
offences. However, criminal statutes or criminal laws passed into law by the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/dail_eireann.html">Oireachtas</a>
do make a distinction between types of crimes and therefore differentiates on
how different crimes will be dealt with by the courts.</p>

<p>When an offence is dealt with in a District Court, the judge is restricted
in the length of sentence they can impose for any offence. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1984/en/act/pub/0022/sec0011.html#zza22y1984s11">Criminal
Justice Act 1984 (Section11)</a> states that the maximum term of imprisonment
that can be imposed by the District Court in respect of any number of offences
for which sentence is passed at the same time cannot exceed 2 years. Similarly,
the District Court cannot exceed a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1951/en/act/pub/0002/sec0004.html">maximum
sentence of 1 year in respect of one offence</a>. </p>

<p>Examples of summary offences are: </p>
<ul><li>Public Order Offence – Begging in an intimidating or threatening
    manner. The penalty for being found guilty of this offence is a <a href="../criminal_trial/maximum_fines_on_summary_conviction.html">class
    E fine</a> or up to one month in prison or both a fine and a term of
    imprisonment. </li>
  <li>Public Order Offence- Threatening abusive or insulting behaviour in a
    public place. The penalty available to a judge where a person is found
    guilty of this offence is a class D fine or up to three months in prison or
    both a fine and a term of imprisonment. </li>
</ul><h3>Are all indictable offences tried in the higher courts?</h3>

<p>Indictable offences are those which may or must be tried on indictment
before a judge and jury, that is, in the Circuit Court or the Central Criminal
Court. However, not all indictable offences are tried before a jury. Indictable
offences can be divided into a number of categories. </p>

<p><strong>A) Offences which must always be tried on indictment</strong></p>

<p>There are a number of offences which must be tried before a judge and jury
and these offences are listed in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1967/en/act/pub/0012/index.html">Criminal
Procedure Act 1967</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0032/index.html">Criminal
Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act 1990</a>. These include:</p>
<ul><li>Offence under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1939/en/act/pub/0010/index.html">Treason
    Act 1939</a> </li>
  <li>Murder, attempted murder, conspiracy to murder </li>
  <li>Piracy </li>
  <li>Rape </li>
  <li>Aggravated sexual assault </li>
</ul><p>In addition to the above there are a number of offences which do not include
an option to be dealt with in the District Court (summary disposal). They must
be dealt with on indictment. Examples of these are:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0026/sec0004.html#zza26y1997s4">Section
    4 of the Non Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997</a> – Assault
    causing serious harm. The penalty on conviction on indictment is a fine or
    imprisonment for life or both. The statute (or piece of law) does not allow
    for this offence to be dealt with summarily. </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0002/sec0014.html#zza2y1994s14">Section
    14 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994</a> - Riot. Again the
    offence can only be dealt with on indictment. </li>
</ul><p><strong>B) Offences which may be tried summarily or by indictment at the
request of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the judge or the
accused</strong></p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1951/en/act/pub/0002/sec0002.html#zza2y1951s2">Section
2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1951</a> as amended by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0004/sec0008.html">Criminal
Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997</a> provides that offences listed
in the First Schedule of the 1951 Act can be dealt with in the District Court
if three conditions are met:</p>
<ol><li>The court is of the opinion that the facts proved or alleged amount to a
    minor offence which the court feels is fit to be tried summarily (in the
    District Court) </li>
  <li>The accused person, when told by the court of his/her right to be tried
    by a judge and a jury, does not object to being tried in the District
    Court, and </li>
  <li>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dppireland.ie/">Director of Public
    Prosecutions (DPP)</a> consents to the accused being tried summarily for
    such offence </li>
</ol><p>In practice, the judge looks to see what the DPP has directed and then asks
the prosecuting Garda for an outline of the facts of the case. The judge then
decides whether or not they are willing to hear the case or send it forward to
a higher court to be dealt with (indictment). If the judge decides to hear the
case in the District Court the accused is given an opportunity to choose
whether to be dealt with in the District Court or the Circuit Court. Normally,
if an accused is given this choice they elect to be dealt with in the District
Court as the maximum penalty available to the District Judge is less than that
available in the Circuit Court.</p>

<p>Examples of some of the offences listed in the First Schedule are:</p>

<p>• Perjury</p>

<p>• Offences under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0014/index.html">Criminal
Law Act 1997</a></p>

<p>• Offences under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0032/index.html">Criminal
Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act 1990</a> </p>

<p>• Offences under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0050/index.html">Criminal
Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001</a></p>

<p><strong>C) Offences which may be tried either summarily or on indictment at
the option of the Director of Public Prosecutions, subject to the agreement of
the District Court judge</strong></p>

<p>This procedure is the same as that outlined at (B) above but without the
accused being given an option as to whether they want the case to be dealt with
in the District or Circuit Court. The offences in this category are created by
statute and the statute or piece of law states the different punishments on
summary conviction and on indictment.</p>

<p>How this process works in practice is that the DPP issues instructions as to
whether the offence should be dealt with in the District or Circuit Court. If
the DPP directs summary disposal (District Court), the District Court judge
hears a summary of the facts from the prosecuting Garda and then decide if they
will allow the case to be dealt with in their court. If the judge is not
satisfied that the offence is a minor offence then they refuse jurisdiction
(that is, refuses to deal with the case) and sends it forward to the Circuit
Court to be dealt with on indictment.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l73512">Minor and non-minor offences</h2>

<p>Article 38.2 of the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Constitution
of Ireland</a> sets out that minor offences may be tried in courts of summary
jurisdiction, that is, the District Court. There is no definition of what a
minor offence is in the Constitution although they are most often set down by
the actual law. The distinction between the constitutional concepts of minor
and non-minor offences equates more or less with the statutory distinction
drawn between summary and indictable offences.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has however considered the issue of what constitutes a
minor offence. The most important case in this area is a case called
<em>Melling v Ó Mathghamhna [1962] IR 1</em>. In examining the criteria or
rules when deciding whether an offence was minor the Supreme Court laid out the
following test:</p>
<ul><li>The severity or seriousness of the punishment </li>
  <li>Moral guilt of the accused </li>
  <li>The law in 1937 when the Constitution was adopted, and </li>
  <li>Public opinion </li>
</ul><p>Of these four tests, it is undoubtable that the most important one is the
severity or seriousness of the sentence.</p>

<p>All that can be said with certainty is that an offence is minor where the
punishment is less than six months imprisonment (<em>Conroy v Attorney General
[1965] IR 411</em>), whereas an offence is non-minor where the punishment is
two years or more (<em>Mallon v Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry
[1996] 1 IR 517</em>). It appears, however, that the courts have come to the
belief an offence with a maximum prison sentence of twelve months constitutes a
minor offence. It can be said as a result that any offence that carries a
penalty of more than twelve months imprisonment is considered a non-minor
offence.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l48f32">Serious and non-serious offences</h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0016/index.html">Bail Act
1997</a> created a new distinction between serious and non-serious offences.
The Act allows bail to be refused where an accused is charged with a serious
offence and it can be established that the accused is likely to commit further
serious offences if released on bail. The Bail Act 1997 defines a serious
offence as an offence for which a person, if convicted, could be imprisoned for
5 years or more.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l43888">Arrestable and non-arrestable
offences</h2>

<p>Just as the Bail Act 1997 created a distinction between serious and
non-serious offences, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0014/index.html">Criminal
Law Act 1997</a> abolished the distinction between a felony and misdemeanour
and created the arrestable/non-arrestable distinction. The Act defines an
arrestable offence as an offence for which a person could be punished by
imprisonment for 5 years or more, similar to the definition of a serious
offence mentioned above.</p>

<p>This distinction holds great importance for the Gardaí. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0014/sec0004.html#zza14y1997s4">Section
4 of the Criminal Law Act 1997</a> allows a Garda to arrest without warrant any
person whom the Garda, with reasonable cause, believes to be guilty of
committing or having committed an arrestable offence.</p>

<p>Any person arrested for such an arrestable offence (without a warrant) can
be detained in a Garda station for a maximum period of 12 hours for questioning
before being charged with an offence or being released. Also, if you remain
silent when questioned by Gardaí in certain circumstances, inferences can be
drawn from your silence in any proceedings against you for an arrestable
offence. <a shape="rect" href="../../arrests/right_to_silence_in_criminal_cases.html">Further
information on your right to silence is available here</a>.</p>

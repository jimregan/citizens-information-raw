<p>The primary legislation under which criminal charges for drugs offences is
brought is the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1977/en/act/pub/0012/index.html">Misuse of
Drugs Act 1977</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1984/en/act/pub/0018/index.html">Misuse of
Drugs Act, 1984</a>. These have been further amended by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1999/en/act/pub/0010/index.html">Criminal
Justice Act 1999</a>, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0026/index.html">Criminal
Justice Act 2006</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/act/pub/0029/index.html">Criminal
Justice Act 2007</a>. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1988/en/si/0328.html">Misuse of Drugs
Regulations 1988 (SI 328 of 1988)</a> (as amended) lists the various substances
to which the legislation applies. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0022/sec0020.html#sec20">Criminal
Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010</a> covers substances which are not
specifically proscribed under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, but which have
psychoactive effects.</p>

<p>The main drug offences under which criminal charges are brought are offences
of drug possession and possession for the purpose of supply. </p>

<h3>Role of the Garda Siochana in combating drug abuse and drug trafficking</h3>

<p>The work of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=28">Criminal Assets Bureau</a> ,
established in 1996, has been very successful in seizing the assets of those
convicted of drug trafficking. The Garda Siochana has also established the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=30">National Drugs
Unit</a> to target national and international drugs trafficking. At local
level, Local Drugs Units police the drugs situation and Garda juvenile liaison
officers work with young people to try and prevent them getting involved with
drugs. In some Local Drugs Task Force areas, Community Policing Fora have been
set up to deal with the drug problem with the help of the community. In October
2008 <a shape="rect" href="../../crime_and_crime_prevention/anti_drug_dealing_initiative.html">Dial
to Stop Drug Dealing</a> was launched. This initiative tackled drug dealing in
local communities by providing a confidential and completely anonymous way for
someone to pass on information on drug dealing in their local community to the
Gardaí.</p>

<p>The Gardai are also involved in a number of awareness-raising programmes
such as the Garda Schools Programme and the <a shape="rect" href="../../children_and_young_offenders/garda_juvenile_diversion_programme.html">Juvenile
Diversion Programme</a>. </p>

<h3>Role of the Customs and Excise service in combating drug trafficking</h3>

<p>The Customs and Excise services are responsible for <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/travel_to_ireland/examination_of_travellers_baggage_by_customs_and_excise_officers.html">detecting
and seizing controlled drugs at importation</a>. There is close co-operation
between the Gardai and the Custom and Excise services in the area of drug law
enforcement and a joint task force involving the Gardai, the Customs and Excise
Services and the Naval Services has been set up. These bodies liaise at a local
level to prevent drug trafficking. The Customs and Excise services are involved
in the Multi-Disciplinary Group on Organised Crime and are also very involved
in the operation of the Criminal Assets Bureau with the Gardai. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/customs/drugs.html">Customs
National Drug Team</a> was set up by the Revenue Commissioners in 1992 to
tackle the illegal importation of drugs into Ireland. </p>

<h3>Customs National Drug Team</h3>

<p>The Customs National Drug Team (CNDT) concentrates solely on combating the
importation of illegal drugs into Ireland. The CNDT has its Head Office located
in Dublin and intelligence units, operational units, maritime units and drug
detector dog units that are strategically placed at all major ports and
airports and at various coastal locations nation-wide. All CNDT units are
mobile and can be deployed to other locations as necessary. The CNDT is
supported by outfield officials who are also responsible for the detection and
prevention of drug smuggling as part of their normal duties. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Possession of controlled drugs - cannabis or cannabis resin</h3>

<p>Under the Misuse of Drugs Acts anyone found in possession of cannabis or
cannabis resin is guilty of an offence. If the court decides that the drug was
for personal use and not for sale or distribution and this was a first offence,
it can impose a <a href="../criminal_trial/maximum_fines_on_summary_conviction.html">class D
fine</a> on summary conviction in a <a shape="rect" href="../../courts_system/circuit_court_criminal_juris.html">District
Court</a>. On conviction on indictment, the defendant can be fined €1,270.
For a second offence, a class D fine may be imposed and on conviction on
indictment, a fine of €2,540 can be imposed. For a third or subsequent
conviction, a class C fine can be imposed. If the court decides, a prison
sentence of not more than 12 months can be imposed as well. On conviction on
indictment, the court may decide on an appropriate fine and/or a prison
sentence of up to three years can be imposed. </p>

<h3>Possession of any other controlled drugs</h3>

<p>It is an offence to be in possession of a controlled drug and on summary
conviction for this offence, you could be liable for a class C fine or a prison
sentence of no longer than 12 months. If the court decides, you could be liable
for both. On conviction on indictment for possessing controlled drugs, the
court can decide on an appropriate fine and you could also be liable for a
prison sentence of not more than 7 years. Again, if the court decides, you
could be liable for both. </p>

<h3>Growing cannabis plants or opium poppies</h3>

<p>It is also an offence to grow cannabis plants or opium poppies and on
summary conviction for this offence, you could be liable for a class C fine or
a prison sentence of no longer than 12 months. If the court decides, you could
be liable for both. On conviction on indictment for growing these plants, the
court can decide on an appropriate fine and you could also be liable for a
prison sentence of not more than 14 years. Again, if the court decides, you
could be liable for both. </p>

<h3>Regulations regarding opium</h3>

<p>It is an offence to use prepared opium (e.g., heroin) for illegal use, to go
to a place for the purposes of using opium or to have any paraphernalia (pipes,
utensils) associated with illegal opium use in your possession. On summary
conviction for this offence, you could be liable for a class C fine or a prison
sentence of no longer than 12 months. If the court decides, you could be liable
for both. On conviction on indictment for this offence, the court can decide on
an appropriate fine and you could also be liable for a prison sentence of no
more than 14 years. Again, if the court decides, you could be liable for
both.</p>

<h3>Possession of controlled drugs for sale or supply</h3>

<p>Under the legislation, it is an offence to be in possession of a controlled
drug with the intention of selling it illegally. Anyone found guilty of this
offence is liable to a class C fine on summary conviction in a District Court.
If the court decides, he or she could be subject to a fine and a prison term
not exceeding 12 months. On conviction on indictment for this offence, the
court can decide on an appropriate fine. The court can also impose a life
sentence for this offence if it decides it is necessary. However, lesser
sentences can also be imposed, either with a fine or alone. </p>

<p>Where the market value of the drugs is €13,000 or more, the person
convicted is liable for a minimum sentence of 10 years. This does not apply,
however, where the court is satisfied there are exceptional circumstances.
Similar penalties apply to somone convicted of importing drugs with a value of
€13,000 or more.</p>

<p>Anyone found guilty of supplying or attempting to supply a controlled drug
into a prison, <a shape="rect" href="../../children_and_young_offenders/detention_of_children_and_young_people.html">children
detention school</a> or remand centre can receive a class B fine on summary
conviction or a prison term not exceeding 12 months or both. On conviction on
indictment, the court can impose an appropriate fine or a maximum prison term
of 10 years or both. </p>

<p>Under the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010 it is an
offence to sell or supply for human consumption substances which are not
specifically proscribed under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, but which have
psychoactive effects. Anyone found guilty of such an offence is liable for a
class A fine on summary conviction or imprisoned for a term not exceeding 12
months or both. On conviction on indictment they can be fined or imprisoned for
a term not exceeding 5 years or both. </p>

<h3>Use of premises, vehicles or vessels for certain activities</h3>

<p>Anyone who occupies or controls any land, vehicle or vessel and is found
guilty of allowing it to be used for activities such as the manufacture,
importation or supply of a controlled drug is liable on summary conviction to a
class C fine or a prison sentence of no longer than 12 months or both. On
conviction on indictment for this offence, the court can impose an appropriate
fine or a prison sentence of no more than 14 years or both.</p>

<h3>Forged or fraudulently altered prescriptions</h3>

<p>It is an offence to forge a prescription or to try to change it in any way
in order to deceive. Anyone found guilty of this offence is liable, on summary
conviction, to a class D fine or a prison sentence not exceeding 6 months. If
the court decides, you could be liable for both. On conviction on indictment
for this offence, the court can decide on an appropriate fine and/or impose a
prison term not exceeding 3 years.</p>

<h3>Attempting or helping others to commit an offence</h3>

<p>It is an offence to attempt to commit a drug offence covered by the
legislation, or to help or incite someone else to commit the drug offence. If
you are found guilty you are liable to be sentenced as if you had committed the
drug offence. </p>

<h3>Court-ordered drug treatment</h3>

<p>For some drugs offences, (illegal possession of controlled drugs, possession
of controlled drugs for unlawful sale or supply, breaking the regulations
regarding opium, growing opium poppies or cannabis plants or forging or
fraudulently altering prescriptions), the court may decide that imposing the
usual penalties is not the most effective response. The court can remand you
for whatever period it considers necessary (no longer than eight days if you
are being held in custody). During this time, the court can ask the <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/how_health_is_organised/health_boards.html">Health
Service Executice (HSE)</a>, a probation officer or other qualified person to
prepare a medical report and/or a report on your vocational, educational and
social circumstances. They may also be asked to make recommendations for your
treatment. </p>

<p>Based on the findings of these reports, the court may decide not to impose a
fine or prison sentence on you. Instead, you may be placed under the
supervision of a named person or body (such as the HSE) for a specified period
of time or you may be required to get the kind of treatment (medical or
otherwise) that has been recommended for you. The court may also order that you
complete a course of education, instruction or training that will improve your
job prospects or social circumstances, facilitate your social rehabilitation or
reduce the likelihood of you committing further drugs offences. </p>

<p>Depending on the circumstances of your case, the court may order that you be
detained in a specialised custodial treatment centre. The period you can be
held for depends on your offence. You cannot be held for longer than a year,
but if the maximum period of imprisonment that the court may impose for your
particular crime is shorter than a year, you can only be held for that period
of time. </p>

<p>If the court decides it is in your best interests, you may not be allowed to
see the contents of any report that has been prepared on your case. However,
the report will be made available to your <a shape="rect" href="../../courtroom/barristers.html">barrister</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../../courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a>. </p>

<p>If you ignore an order of the court, you can be detained in a custodial
treatment centre or have the usual penalties for your offence (fines and/or
imprisonment) imposed on you. </p>

<p>If you have been sent to a custodial treatment centre by a court order, you
can make an application to the court that detention is no longer in your best
interest or in the best interests of other people at the centre. Based on this
application, the court can review your case and revoke the detention order. It
then has a number of options open to it. If the court decides that you are
still in need of treatment, it can order your continued detention, possibly in
another treatment centre. If custodial treatment is not considered necessary,
you may be ordered to continue treatment but not on a custodial basis. The
court can also decide to impose the usual penalties (prison sentence and/or
fine) under the Misuse of Drugs Act for your offence if it considers it
appropriate to do so. This will depend on the circumstances of your case and if
a prison sentence is imposed, the court must take into account the amount of
time you have already been detained in a treatment centre. The court also has
the option of not imposing any penalty if it is satisfied that you are no
longer in need of treatment and that the circumstances of your case do not
warrant further penalties.</p>

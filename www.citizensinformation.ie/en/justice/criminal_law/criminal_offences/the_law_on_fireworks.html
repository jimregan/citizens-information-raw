<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Up to 2006 the law on fireworks in Ireland was unclear. While serious
accidents have resulted from using fireworks, the law only covered the
importation of fireworks into Ireland without a licence. This was more a
customs and excise issue rather than a criminal issue.</p>

<p>Part 6 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0026/sec0068.html#sec68">Criminal
Justice Act 2006</a> amended the Explosives Act 1875 to give the Gardaí the
power to make arrests in relation to possession of unlicensed fireworks.</p>

<h3>What does firework mean under the law?</h3>

<p>The law gives a very technical definition of a firework. A firework includes
all those devices which burn and explode to give a loud noise and a visual
effect – basically a typical, traditional firework. Bangers are now defined
as fireworks.</p>

<p>Since 4 April 2010, under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/si/0001.html">European Communities
(Placing on the Market of Pyrotechnic Articles) Regulations 2010 (SI
1/2010)</a> low hazard fireworks are included as category 1 fireworks. These
low hazard fireworks are designed for indoor use and include items such as
party-poppers, certain sparklers, Christmas crackers and strips of bangers or
caps for toy guns. While categry 1 fireworks are available for sale to and use
by the general public, it is an offence to sell category 1 fireworks to anyone
under 16 years of age. </p>

<h3>What are the offences for having a firework?</h3>

<p>Under the amended legislation the following are offences:</p>
<ul><li>If you ignite a firework or cause it to be ignited in any place, you are
    guilty of an offence. The offence of igniting a firework can take place
    anywhere and not just in a public place. It can include the garden of a
    private house. </li>
  <li>If you throw, direct or propel an ignited firework at or towards someone
    else or at property, you are guilty of an offence. </li>
  <li>If you have a firework with the intention of selling or supplying it to
    someone else (and you don't hold a licence to import it) you are guilty of
    an offence. </li>
</ul><p>If you are found guilty of any of the above offences you are liable:</p>
<ul><li>On summary conviction (in the District Court) to a <a href="../criminal_trial/maximum_fines_on_summary_conviction.html">class
    C fine</a> or to imprisonment for up to 6 months or to both. </li>
  <li>On conviction on indictment (in the Circuit Court) to a maximum fine of
    €10,000 or to imprisonment for up to 5 years or to both. </li>
</ul><p>The offences mentioned above are <a shape="rect" href="classification_of_crimes_in_criminal_cases.html">arrestable offences</a>
because they carry a possible 5 year jail sentence. Therefore the Gardaí have
the power to arrest you without warrant if they reasonably suspect you of
having committed such an offence. They can also detain you in a Garda station
for questioning for up to 12 hours before you are charged with the offence or
released.</p>

<h3>What can the Gardaí do when investigating these offences?</h3>

<p>The Gardaí have been given wide powers in relation to the investigation of
these offences. If the Gardaí reasonably suspect you of possessing fireworks
for sale or supply without a licence they may:</p>
<ul><li>Request your name and address </li>
  <li>Request you to go to the Garda station for the purpose of verifying your
    name and address (if they are not satisfied your details are correct) </li>
  <li>Search you without a warrant and detain you for such time as is necessary
    for the search </li>
  <li>Enter and search any vehicle, vessel or aircraft without a warrant, if
    they suspect that a firework may be found there </li>
  <li>Seize and detain anything found in the course of the search, which is
    connected with fireworks </li>
</ul><p>If the Gardaí suspect that an offence of sale or supply of fireworks
without a licence has been committed by you, they may arrest you without a
warrant.</p>

<p>The Gardaí have also been given the power to apply to the District Court
for a search warrant which allows them to search a premises at any time (or
times) within one week from the date of issue of the warrant. The warrant
allows the Gardaí to enter a premises, by force if necessary, and it also
allows them to seize anything found in the search. The Gardaí are allowed to
demand the name and address of anyone who is present at the premises when they
are searching it.</p>

<p>Anybody who obstructs the Gardaí during the search under the warrant may be
arrested. If found guilty in court, you may be liable on summary conviction to
a class C fine or to imprisonment for up to 6 months, or to both.</p>

<h3>Can I organise a fireworks display at a special event such as a party?</h3>

<p>Yes, but the fireworks must be licensed for import and only if a
professional fireworks operator is used. If you want to import fireworks into
Ireland you must apply for a licence or get a professional fireworks operator
to apply, on your behalf, to the Department of Justice and Equality. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pyrotechnics%20Importation%20App%20Form.doc/Files/Pyrotechnics%20Importation%20App%20Form.doc">Application
forms are available (Word)</a> from the Department and can be downloaded from
the Department's website. The application must be made <strong>at least one
month</strong> before the proposed event. The licence is free.</p>

<p>Details which you must provide when applying include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Your name and address as the applicant </li>
  <li>The name and address of the organiser of the fireworks display </li>
  <li>The name and address of the operator of the display </li>
  <li>The name and address of the safety officer for the display </li>
  <li>The date, location and reason for the display </li>
</ul><p>Furthermore you must confirm to the Department:</p>
<ul><li>That you have read and are aware of the contents of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Guidance%20Doc%20on%20Organised%20Pyro%20Displays.pdf/Files/Guidance%20Doc%20on%20Organised%20Pyro%20Displays.pdf">Guidance
    Document on Organised Pyrotechnic Displays (pdf)</a>. This document is
    available fromthe Department. </li>
  <li>That all operators used in the display are competent, in accordance with
    the guidance document. </li>
  <li>That adequate public liability insurance is in place. </li>
  <li>That you have consulted the local authority Fire Officer. </li>
  <li>That you have consulted the local Gardaí. </li>
  <li>That you have consulted with all other relevant interested parties, for
    example, your neighbours. </li>
</ul><p>If granted, the licence allows you to import the fireworks and operate and
display them in accordance with the terms set out in the licence.</p>

<p>It is important to note that anyone who operates a fireworks display (even a
small one in your own garden), without the appropriate licence is committing an
offence which carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment.</p>

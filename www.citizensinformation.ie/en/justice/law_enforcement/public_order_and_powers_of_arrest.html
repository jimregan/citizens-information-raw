</ul><p>As can be seen from the above, the Gardaí are given a power of arrest
without warrant for almost all of the offences contained in this Act. </p>

<h3>The bystander test</h3>

<p>For the offence of riot, violent disorder or affray, the <em>bystander
test</em> is applied. This means that if a bystander was present at the scene
of the event or offence while it is being committed, they would fear for their
own safety or the safety of someone else. </p>

<h3>Public place </h3>

<p>In the Act a number of offences are included which only become offences if
they are committed in a public place. For example, offences under Sections 4 to
9 of the Act are limited to a public place. The definition of a public place is
contained in Section 3 of the Act and includes almost all places. It is one of
the widest definitions of a public place in the criminal justice system. </p>

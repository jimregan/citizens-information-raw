<p>Every year many concerts, festivals, public meetings and major events take
place in Ireland. Article 40 of <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Bunreacht
na hEireann (the Irish Constitution)</a> guarantees your right to assemble or
meet peacefully and without weapons. This right is limited by legislation to
protect public order and morality. The law as discussed below prevents or
controls meetings that are calculated or designed to cause a riot or breach of
the peace. There is more information about these <a shape="rect" href="../criminal_law/criminal_offences/public_order_offenses_in_ireland.html">public
order offences here</a>. </p>

<p>The purpose of crowd control at public events is to maintain public peace
and order and ensure the safety of all who are gathered there. There are laws
in place designed to give the Gardai (Irish police force) clear and
comprehensive legal powers to deal with crowd control.</p>

<p>Part III of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 is the main law on
this area and is based on the recommendations of the Hamilton Committee on
Public Safety and Crowd Control. That committee was established in the wake of
the Hillsborough disaster in the UK in 1989.</p>

<h3>Control of access to certain events</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0002/sec0021.html#zza2y1994s21">Section
21 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994</a> empowers the Gardai to
place barriers on roads up to one mile (1.6 km) from where a particular event
is taking place. The decision on the placing of barriers must be made by a
Garda who is of Superintendent rank or higher. When the barriers are in place
the Gardai are allowed to prohibit people from crossing or passing the barrier
if the person does not have a ticket for the event. The Garda may also seize
any alcohol or disposable drinks containers or any offensive article at the
barrier before allowing a person to proceed to the event.</p>

<p>Section 21 also allows people to pass the barriers if they are going to
their home or place of work. They may also pass the barriers if they are going
to any place in the area of the event if it is for a lawful purpose. Anyone who
fails to obey the direction given by a Garda at a barrier will be guilty of an
offence and is liable to a <a href="../criminal_law/criminal_trial/maximum_fines_on_summary_conviction.html">class
D fine</a>. </p>

<h3>Surrender and seizure of intoxicating liquor</h3>

<p>There are rules in Ireland regarding the serving and sale of alcohol. These
rules are set out in the various Intoxicating Liquor Acts. There is more about
<a shape="rect" href="../criminal_law/criminal_offences/alcohol_and_the_law.html">the law on
alcohol in Ireland</a> here.</p>

<p>The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 also gives the Gardai the power
to search a person going to an event where a barrier has been erected. These
rights are set out in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0002/sec0022.html">Section
22 of the 1994 Act</a> and allow the Gardai to seize intoxicating liquor or any
disposable container or any other article which could be used to cause injury.
</p>

<p>This law also allows a Garda to refuse to allow someone to proceed to the
event where they refuse to surrender or give up the intoxicating liquor,
disposable container or other article concerned. The Gardai may also require
that you to leave the area in an orderly and peaceful manner. If you fail to
comply with such a request by the Garda without lawful authority or reasonable
excuse then you will be guilty of an offence. The fine for this offence is a
class D fine. <br></p>

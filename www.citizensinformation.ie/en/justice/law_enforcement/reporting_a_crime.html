<p>If you live in Ireland and are a victim of a crime, you should contact the
Gardai (Irish police force). The emergency services telephone number is 999 or
112. In less urgent situations, you should contact <a shape="rect" href="http://www.garda.ie/Stations/Default.aspx">your local Garda station</a>.
</p>

<p>The Gardaí must give your case equal priority with other cases, whatever
your gender, race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, age, economic
circumstances or membership of any minority group. <a shape="rect" href="../victims_of_crime/victims_and_the_garda_siochana.html">Read here for
more information about reporting a crime to the Gardaí</a>.</p>

<p>The Gardai will explain the investigation process to you and make sure that
you are kept informed about the progress of the investigation, including
whether a suspect is charged or cautioned. You will also be told about the <a shape="rect" href="../victims_of_crime/victim_support.html">support services
available to victims of crime</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.crimestoppers.ie/">Crimestoppers</a> is a partnership
between the Gardai and the business community. You can give information to the
Gardai about any criminal investigation using the confidential freephone number
1800 25 00 25. This confidential freephone number is staffed by members of the
Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=111&amp;Lang=1">Garda
Traffic Watch</a> hotline allows you report incidents of dangerous driving to
the Gardai so that the drivers can be intercepted, cautioned and brought
through the courts process. The Garda Traffic Watch hotline is contactable by
telephone at 1890 205 805.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dppireland.ie/brief-guide-to-the-criminal-justice-system/category/1/">Furher
information on reporting a crime</a> is available on the Director of Public
Prosecutions (DPP) website.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.garda.ie/">Garda Síochána</a> (also commonly
referred to as the Gardaí) is the national police force. The name Garda
Síochána in English means 'guardians of the peace'. The primary legislation
under which it functions is the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0020/index.html">Garda
Síochána Act 2005</a>.</p>

<p>The Garda Síochána has responsibility for carrying out all policing duties
in the Irish State. In addition, it provides State security services and
carries out all criminal and traffic law enforcement.</p>

<p>The Gardaí have many powers including the <a href="../arrests/arrests.html">powers to arrest you</a> if they suspect you
of committing a criminal offence. They also have the <a href="../arrests/powers_of_search.html">powers to search you or your
property</a>.</p>

<h3>Police Certificates</h3>

<p>Police Certificates are often required before you can apply for a visa to
visit or travel to other countries. There is <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_abroad/leaving_ireland/police_certificate.html">more
information about how to get a Police Certificate here</a>. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l3dfed">Organisation and structure</h2>

<p>The Minister for Justice and Equality is accountable to the <a href="../../government_in_ireland/national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/">Oireachtas</a>
for the performance of the Garda Síochána. A Garda Commissioner is, however,
appointed by the Government and is responsible for the day-to-day running of
the force.</p>

<p>On 1 January 2016, an independent <a href="http://www.policingauthority.ie/">Policing Authority</a> was established
under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/pdf/2015/en.act.2015.0049.pdf">Garda
Síochána (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 (pdf)</a>
to oversee the performance of the Garda Síochána in relation to policing
services.</p>

<p>The Commissioner has 2 Deputy Commissioners and 12 Assistant Commissioners.
Below Assistant Commissioner the Garda rank structure is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Chief Superintendent</li>
  <li>Superintendent</li>
  <li>Inspector</li>
  <li>Sergeant</li>
  <li>Garda</li>
</ul><p>For policing purposes, Ireland is <a href="http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=21&amp;Lang=1">divided into 6
regions</a>, each of which has a regional Assistant Commissioner. Each region
is made up of a number of Garda divisions. A Chief Superintendent is in charge
of a division, which is in turn made up of districts.</p>

<p>Each district has a superintendent in charge. Districts are divided into
sub-districts, each normally the responsibility of a sergeant. Each
sub-district usually has only 1 Garda station. The number of Gardaí in a
sub-district can vary from 3 to 100 Gardaí.</p>

<p>The basic command unit is the district. The superintendent in charge is also
known as the District Officer and has a number of specific functions relating
to such matters as the licensing of bars and the issuing of firearms
certificates.</p>

<p>There are approximately 13,000 members of the Garda Síochána. Uniformed
Gardaí do not routinely carry firearms.</p>

<h3>Garda Reserve</h3>

<p>The Garda Reserve is an unpaid body of voluntary members and can provide
extra personnel when required. Reserve Gardaí have certain Garda powers while
on duty and perform their policing duties under the supervision of, and
supported by, regular Gardaí.</p>

<p>Their principal role consists of local patrols and crime reduction
initiatives, targeted at specific local problem areas.</p>

<p>Information on the Garda Reserve is available on the <a href="http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=165&amp;Lang=1">Garda
website</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lb120c">Reporting a crime </h2>

<p>If you are a victim of a crime you should contact the Gardaí. The emergency
services telephone number is <a href="http://www.112.ie/">999 or 112</a>. In
less urgent situations you should <a shape="rect" href="http://www.garda.ie/Stations/Default.aspx">contact your local Garda
station</a>. There is more information about reporting a crime to the Gardaí
in our document on <a shape="rect" href="../victims_of_crime/victims_and_the_garda_siochana.html">victims of crime
and the Garda Síochána</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.crimestoppers.ie/">Crimestoppers</a> is an initiative
operated by the Gardaí and the business community. You can give information to
the Gardaí about any criminal investigation using the confidential freephone
number 1800 25 00 25. This confidential freephone number is staffed by
specially trained detective Gardaí.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=7978">additional information on
reporting a crime</a> on the Garda website.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l9713c">Getting access to information about you held
by the Gardaí</h2>

<p>Under the Data Protection Acts you have the right to be told whether the
Gardaí have any information held on file about you. You also have a right to a
copy of that information. </p>

<p>If, however, the Gardaí are holding information about you and giving the
information to you would be likely to prejudice the prevention, detection and
investigation of crime or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, you
will not be given access to this information. </p>

<p>You can read <a shape="rect" href="../law_and_rights/access_to_garda_records.html">more about access to
Garda records here</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lb09df">Complaints</h2>

<p>If you are not fully satisfied with the assistance you have received from
members of the Garda Siochána or if you have any enquiries or suggestions, you
should contact the Garda Victim Liaison Officer or your local superintendent.
You will receive a reply within 21 days. </p>

<p>You can also make a complaint about a member of the Gardaí to the <a shape="rect" href="garda_siochana_ombudsman_commission.html">Garda
Ombudsman</a>. The Garda Ombudsman deals with complaints that contain
allegations of criminal offences and improper conduct. For example, if a Garda
is intoxicated on duty.</p>

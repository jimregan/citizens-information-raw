<p>A Police Certificate is a statement about you issued by the Gardaí. The
certificate, which is normally valid for one year, states your name, address,
date of birth and also includes information about whether or not you have a
criminal record. This does not include <a href="../../../justice/law_enforcement/adult_cautioning_scheme.html">adult
cautions</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Spent convictions:</strong> The Irish <a href="../../../justice/criminal_law/spent_convictions.html">spent
convictions legislation</a> cannot be used to prevent disclosure when you are
required to disclose information about your criminal convictions to another
state.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You can only get a Police Certificate in certain circumstances. They are
issued when required by consular authorities. For example, Police Certificates
are often required before you can apply for a visa to visit or travel to other
countries. They are not issued for employment or any other purpose. However,
they can be issued for the setting up or registering a business in another EU
member state.</p>

<p>Requests for Police Certificates are not processed in your local Garda
station but instead, are sent to the Superintendent for the district where you
live or used to live. Your completed Police Certificate will be issued directly
from the district office and it can take up to 3 weeks for it to be issued.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You should make your application in writing to the Superintendent in charge
of the district where you live. If you no longer live in Ireland, write to the
Superintendent for the district where you use to live. If you leave your
application into your local Garda station for forwarding to the Superintendent
for the district, you should take note of the Garda's name or shoulder number.
</p>

<p>Your application in writing should include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Your full name as on your birth certificate including your maiden name if
    applicable </li>
  <li>Your date and place of birth (or a copy of your birth certificate) </li>
  <li>Your current address </li>
  <li>All addresses at which you have lived at in Ireland and when you lived
    there </li>
  <li>The place and purpose for which you require the Certificate </li>
</ul><p>You should also include with your application:</p>
<ul><li>A copy of your passport, driving licence or similar for identification
    purposes </li>
  <li>A <a href="http://www.anpost.ie/AnPost/IrishStamps/How+to+Buy/">stamped</a>,
    self addressed envelope </li>
</ul><p>Your application will take approximately 3 weeks to process. </p>

<h3>Irish people living abroad</h3>

<p>Generally speaking, if you are an Irish person living abroad it is not
possible to obtain a Police Certificate from Ireland unless you require it: </p>
<ul><li>For visa purposes </li>
  <li>To apply for residency in another country</li>
</ul><p>In the above instances, write to the Superintendent of your police district
here in Ireland and request a Police Certificate. </p>

<p>However, if you are living abroad and require a Police Certificate from
Ireland for something like a job, you could get in touch with the local police
in the country where you now live. Explain to them what you require and they
may get in touch on your behalf with your nearest police station here in
Ireland and request this information. </p>

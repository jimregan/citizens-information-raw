<p>The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) or Garda Ombudsman is the
independent, statutory agency that deals with complaints from the general
public about members of the Garda Síochána (the Irish police force). It was
established under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0020/index.html">Garda
Síochána Act 2005</a>. The Garda Ombudsman replaced the Garda Síochána
Complaints Board from May 2007, but has a substantially expanded role.</p>

<p>The Garda Síochána Act 2005 also legislated for the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.gsinsp.ie/">Garda Síochána Inspectorate</a> which was
established in July 2006. It, however, deals with the overall policing
performance of the Garda Síochána with regard to its operation and
administration and it advises on best policing practice.</p>

<h3>Who can make a complaint?</h3>

<p>Anyone can make a complaint to the Garda Ombudsman about the behaviour of a
Garda. You must, however, have either witnessed the incident in question or
been directly affected by it. You can make a complaint on behalf of someone
else provided you have the person's consent, orally or in writing. You can also
make a complaint on behalf of someone else who is unable to give consent due to
the person's age or incapacity. </p>

<p>While no lower age limit applies, it is generally expected that a complaint
from a child or young person would be made by a parent, guardian or responsible
adult.</p>

<h3>How soon must a complaint be made?</h3>

<p>Complaints must be made within 12 months of the incident, although, the
Garda Ombudsman may extend the time limit if there are good reasons.</p>

<h3>How do I make a complaint?</h3>

<p>You can make a complaint by calling in person, by writing or by emailing to
the Garda Ombudsman's offices. You can also make a complaint by calling to any
Garda station. No matter how you make your complaint you will be asked to
complete a complaint form (GSOC 1). </p>

<p>You can also make a complaint online through its website.</p>

<p>You will receive an acknowledgement from the Garda Ombudsman once the form
has been received.</p>

<h3>Does the Garda Ombudsman investigate all complaints?</h3>

<p>On receiving your complaint the Garda Ombudsman must decide whether your
complaint is admissible and that it can handle your complaint. To be admissible
a complaint must be:</p>
<ul><li>Made by someone who is entitled to complain </li>
  <li>About conduct by a Garda that could be considered misbehaviour </li>
  <li>Made within the acceptable time limit </li>
</ul><p>A complaint is not considered admissible if it is false or misleading. If
your complaint is not considered admissible you will be informed of this in
writing.</p>

<p>If the Garda Ombudsman accepts your complaint as admissible, it may be
handled in one of four different ways.</p>
<ul><li>Informal resolution or mediation </li>
  <li>Garda investigation </li>
  <li>Garda investigation under Garda Ombudsman supervision </li>
  <li>Investigation by the Garda Ombudsman </li>
</ul><h3>When is a complaint handled through informal resolution or mediation?</h3>

<p>If your complaint is considered less serious it may be decided to resolve it
through mediation or informal resolution. Both you and the Garda must agree to
the complaint being dealt with in this way. You can request a formal
investigation at any stage.</p>

<p>The Garda Ombudsman has developed guidelines for the resolution of
complaints through mediation or other informal means. If it is decided to try
and resolve your complaint by informal means, this may be undertaken by a Garda
Ombudsman Case Officer or by a Garda of supervisory rank. If it is decided to
use mediation the Garda Ombudsman will nominate a trained mediator. You may ask
for a different mediator.</p>

<p>If your case is resolved informally no record of the complaint is kept on
the Garda's personnel file. No statement made during the course of the informal
resolution or mediation can be used in any civil or criminal proceedings,
including disciplinary procedures.</p>

<h3>If it is decided to investigate my complaint who will do it?</h3>

<p>The Garda Ombudsman may decide to refer your complaint to the Garda
Commissioner for investigation by the Gardaí to see if there was a breach of
discipline under Garda disciplinary regulations. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/si/0214.html">The Garda Síochána
(Discipline) Regulations 2007 (SI 214 of 2007) are available here</a>. If you
are not satisfied with the outcome of the Garda investigation you can ask the
Garda Ombudsman to review your case.</p>

<p>The Garda Ombudsman may decide to supervise a Garda investigation of your
complaint. In this case the Gardaí report on the progress of the investigation
to the Garda Ombudsman, in accordance with agreed guidelines. The Garda
Ombudsman can direct the Garda investigation, as it sees fit, and it can take
over the investigation if it wants to.</p>

<p>The Garda Ombudsman may decide to investigate your complaint itself and
usually does in the case of serious complaints. It always does so where a
complaint involves the death of, or serious harm to, someone due to a Garda
operation, or while in Garda custody or care.</p>

<h3>What happens if my complaint is found to be justified?</h3>

<p>If it is found that there was a breach of discipline under Garda
disciplinary regulations, the Garda Ombudsman can recommend disciplinary
proceedings to the Garda Commissioner. If it is felt that criminal proceedings
should be considered the Garda Ombudsman can send a file on the case to the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dppireland.ie/">Director of Public
Prosecutions</a>.</p>

<p>If there is not enough evidence to support either of these actions, the case
may be dismissed. The Garda Ombudsman has no powers to impose penalties or
sanctions itself.</p>

<h3>Can I make a complaint about an off-duty Garda?</h3>

<p>The Garda Ombudsman does not deal with complaints about the behaviour of an
off-duty Garda unless the behaviour complained of is likely to bring discredit
on the Gardaí. It also investigates where the conduct of an off-duty Garda may
have resulted in the death of, or serious harm to, someone.</p>

<h3>Can I make a complaint against a former Garda?</h3>

<p>The Garda Ombudsman may deal with a complaint against a former Garda even if
the Garda resigns or retires after you make your complaint. If the complaint is
about conduct that could be considered a breach of discipline the investigation
is discontinued, providing it is not considered necessary or practical, given
the circumstances, to continue. However, if the complaint is about criminal
behaviour the investigation is continued.</p>

<h3>Are there any penalties for making a false complaint?</h3>

<p>It is an offence to provide false or misleading information in connection
with a complaint or investigation and you are liable on conviction to a <a href="../criminal_law/criminal_trial/maximum_fines_on_summary_conviction.html">class
C fine</a> or imprisonment for up to 6 months, or both.</p>

<h3>Does the Garda Ombudsman carry out investigations without receiving a
complaint?</h3>

<p>If it feels that it is in the public interest, the Garda Ombudsman can,
without receiving a complaint, investigate any matter that appears to indicate
that a Garda may have committed a criminal offence or behaved in a way that
would justify disciplinary proceedings. It also investigates any matter that
appears to indicate that the conduct of a Garda may have resulted in the death
of, or serious harm to, someone.</p>

<p>The Garda Ombudsman may also investigate the practices, policies and
procedures of the Gardaí, if requested to do so by the Minister for Justice
and Equalty, and make recommendations in order to reduce or eliminate
complaints.</p>

<p>As an alternative to imposing a custodial sentence, the courts can impose
restrictions on the movements of those convicted of some minor offences. These
restrictions are known as <em>restriction on movement orders</em> and were
introduced under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0026/sec0101.html#sec101">Section
101 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006</a>.</p>

<p>A restriction on movement order only applies where someone aged 18 years or
over has been convicted by the court and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of
3 months or more. The court cannot impose a restriction on movement order for a
period longer than 6 months.</p>

<h3>What restrictions can the order impose on me?</h3>

<p>The order can restrict your movements as the court considers appropriate and
may include a curfew element. This would oblige you to be in a particular place
for a particular period. For example, you may be required to be at your home
between the hours of 8pm and 8am. </p>

<p>Similarly, the order could include a prohibition forbidding you from being
in a particular place for a particular period. For example, you may be required
to stay away from a certain named street or premises between 8pm and 8am. </p>

<p>An order cannot require you to remain in a place or places for more than 12
hours in a day.</p>

<p>The court arranges for a copy of the restriction on movement order to be
sent to the Garda station which looks after the area where the offender
resides.</p>

<h3>Can orders be changed or varied after they are made?</h3>

<p>Yes. A court may vary an order on the written application of the following
people: </p>
<ul><li>The offender </li>
  <li>The owner of the premises specified in the order </li>
  <li>An adult normally resident at the premises specified in the order </li>
  <li>A member of the Garda Síochána </li>
</ul><p>The court may vary the order by substituting another place or period of time
for the place or time already specified in the order. </p>

<h3>Can I have more than one restriction on movement order placed on me?</h3>

<p>Yes you can. Where more than one order is in place, however, the period of
time that you are required to remain at a place or places cannot exceed 6
months.</p>

<p>Where orders are imposed for two or more offences they may be concurrent –
that is, they run at the same time – or they may be consecutive – that is,
the second order will only begin when the first order finishes. In either event
the total period of time that you are required to remain at a place or places
cannot exceed a maximum of 6 months.</p>

<h3>What happens if I fail to comply with the order?</h3>

<p>As the Gardai in your area receive a copy of your order from the court, they
have responsibility for ensuring you comply with it. If the Gardai are of the
opinion that you have breached the order they can go back to the court and let
the court know. If the court considers that you have breached the order the
court can do any of the following:</p>
<ul><li>Direct you to comply with the order </li>
  <li>Cancel the order and impose another restriction on movement order on you
  </li>
  <li>Cancel the order and deal with your case in whatever other way it could
    have been dealt with before the order was made </li>
</ul><p>In reality this means that the court has the power to re-activate or to
impose the original prison sentence and send you to jail, if you fail to obey
the restriction of movement order.</p>

imposed?</h3>

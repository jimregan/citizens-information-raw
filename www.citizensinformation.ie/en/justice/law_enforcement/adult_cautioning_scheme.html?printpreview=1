<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>In February 2006 a new scheme came into effect in Ireland as an alternative
to prosecuting adults (that is, those over 18 years of age) for certain
criminal offences. The scheme is called the Adult Cautioning Scheme and may be
available as an alternative to prosecution where there is evidence that the
person has committed the offence and where the prosecution of such an offence
is not required in the public interest. Adult cautions are not disclosed in <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/monitoring_and_surveillance_at_work/garda_clearance_for_employees.html">Garda
vetting reports</a> and <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_abroad/leaving_ireland/police_certificate.html">police
certificates</a>.</p>

<p>There are a number of specific criminal offences to which this Scheme can be
applied; these offences are set out below. It is important to note that the
Scheme can only be considered for these offences. </p>

<h3>Who makes the decision to caution?</h3>

<p>If you are arrested for one of the criminal offences covered by the Scheme,
the decision to administer a caution (rather than prosecuting you) is made by
the local Garda Superintendent (or a Garda Inspector who is acting as the local
Superintendent). In deciding whether or not to issue a caution, the Gardaí
must consider:</p>
<ul><li>The public interest </li>
  <li>The views of the victim </li>
  <li>The decision to caution </li>
</ul><p>The Garda Superintendent will inform you that they are considering not
prosecuting you if you are prepared to accept a caution in respect of the
matter. They will also issue you with a warning that any future behaviour of
such a criminal kind will likely result in a prosecution. You must also accept
responsibility for your behaviour before you are considered for cautioning.</p>

<h3>What is the public interest?</h3>

<p>The decision to administer a caution instead of prosecution is a serious
decision and the Garda Superintendent must be satisfied that the offence is
appropriate for a caution. This does not only mean that the offence is included
in the Schedule of Offences which are part of the Scheme. While this is
necessary, it is also necessary to look at the particular circumstances in
which the offence has been committed. If the public interest doesn't require a
prosecution in those circumstances, then you may be cautioned. </p>

<p>Another matter to be considered when looking at the public interest is the
offender. It would seem appropriate, for example, that someone of mature age
without any previous convictions would be dealt with effectively by way of
caution and would be deterred from similar behaviour in the future. It may not,
however, be appropriate to consider a habitual criminal for inclusion in the
Scheme as it would be questionable as to what effect, if any, a caution would
have on him or her.</p>

<h3>How are the views of the victim considered?</h3>

<p>Before any decision is made to administer a caution, the views of any victim
must, if possible, be sought by the Gardaí. If the victim is of the view that
a caution should not be given, any reasons offered by the victim must be
carefully considered by the Garda Superintendent before the decision is made.
It is possible, however, for a caution to be administered by the Superintendent
even if the victim is opposed to it. In such cases, the Gardaí may seek advice
from the Director of Public Prosecutions before making a decision to caution or
not. </p>

<p>If you offer compensation to the victim it may support any decision to
administer a caution. The decision to caution however, does not rest on the
issue of compensation alone. That is to say, the Gardaí do not become involved
in recommending compensation by the offender to the victim.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lcf0dd">The cautioning procedure</h2>

<p>A Garda Superintendent or a Garda Inspector who is acting as the
Superintendent administers the Adult Caution. The caution takes place in a
Garda station. You are required to acknowledge in writing that you agree to
accept the caution and that you do not object to the fact that the caution will
be recorded and will be made known to a court in the event of any subsequent
conviction for any criminal offence.</p>

<h3>Can an offender receive a second Adult Caution?</h3>

<p>The idea of the caution is that it should only be applied
<strong>once</strong> to an offender, but it may (only in the most exceptional
circumstances) be applied to someone who has previously been cautioned.
Examples of such exceptional circumstances include:</p>
<ul><li>Where the subsequent offence is a very minor one </li>
  <li>Where there has been a long gap in time since the first caution was given
    and the Superintendent believes that a second caution after such a time
    lapse would benefit the person </li>
</ul><p>If a Superintendent decides to give a second or subsequent caution to any
person, then the Gardaí must first obtain the permission of the Director of
Public Prosecutions. </p>

<h3>How is the decision made to administer a caution?</h3>

<p>When a Garda has detected an offence which is included in the list of
offences, the Garda fills out an Adult Caution Referral Form, if he/she
believes the offender may be suitable for an Adult Caution. The offender is
then told by the member in charge of the Garda station in ordinary language
what the Adult Cautioning Scheme is. If the offender understands the procedure
and agrees to being considered for the Scheme, then the offender is asked by
the Garda to sign Part E of the Referral Form. This signature is witnessed by
the Gardaí. </p>

<p>The member in charge of the Garda Station forwards the Referral Form to the
Superintendent with his/her views and recommendations. The Superintendent then
does one of three things:</p>
<ul><li>Decides to administer an Adult Caution </li>
  <li>Decides to refuse an Adult Caution </li>
  <li>Decides to refer the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions for
    direction </li>
</ul><h3>When is the caution administered?</h3>

<p>If it is decided to administer a caution, the member in charge of the Garda
station arranges a suitable time and venue for the administering of the caution
by the Superintendent. Once the caution is administered, a copy of the
completed Adult Caution Referral Form is given to the offender. </p>

<p>The entire procedure from the detection of the crime to the completion of
the administering of the caution is carried out as soon as is possible, that
is, in days rather than months.</p>

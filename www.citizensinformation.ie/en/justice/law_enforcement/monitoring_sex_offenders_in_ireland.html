<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Upon conviction of a sexual offence, the court is required to issue a
certificate, stating the offence, to the Gardaí, the convicted offender and
the governor of the facility where the offender is to be detained. The
certificate also sets out the sentence received and the fact that the person
has become subject to a reporting requirement.</p>

<p>The court issues this certificate on behalf of the Gardaí to the Domestic
Violence and Sexual Assault Unit. This means that details of everyone subject
to the requirements of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0018/index.html">Sex
Offenders Act 2001</a> are given to the Domestic Violence and Sex Assault Unit
who keep a record of each individual by way of the court certificate (commonly
known as the <a shape="rect" href="../criminal_law/criminal_trial/sex_offenders_register.html">Sex Offenders
Register</a>). This information is then cross-referenced with the Sex Offenders
Notification Form supplied by the local Garda Station and in this way the sex
offenders may be monitored.</p>

<p>At a local level the Gardaí, through nominated Inspectors, regularly make
enquiries to ensure that the sex offenders in the local district are still
residing at the address given in the notification form and that all the
information contained in the notification form is accurate and up to date. A
nominated Inspector in each Garda Division has responsibility for liaising with
the central Garda Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Unit for the purpose of
monitoring the application of the Sex Offenders Act 2001 in general. </p>

<h3>Post-release supervision</h3>

<p>When a court convicts someone of a qualifying sexual offence it is obliged
when sentencing the offender to consider whether or not to impose a sentence
involving post-release supervision. In doing so the court must take the
following into account:</p>
<ul><li>The need for a period of post-release supervision of the offender </li>
  <li>The need to protect the public from serious harm from the offender </li>
  <li>The need to prevent the commission of further sexual offences by the
    offender </li>
  <li>The need to rehabilitate or further rehabilitate the offender </li>
</ul><p>In deciding whether or not to impose a sentence involving post-release
supervision the court may hear evidence or submissions from any concerned
person. Any period of post-release supervision imposed on the sex offender by
the court will be supervised by the Probation Service which liaises with the
Gardaí in order to ensure the sex offender complies with the supervision
order. Examples of conditions which the court may include in the order of
supervision are:</p>
<ul><li>Prohibiting the sex offender from attending certain places, such as
    schools, sports-clubs and play-grounds </li>
  <li>Requiring the sex offender to receive psychological counselling or other
    appropriate treatment during the period of supervision </li>
</ul><p>If a sex offender fails or refuses to comply, without reasonable excuse,
with the requirements relating to supervision, the offender is committing an
offence and is liable, on summary conviction, to a <a href="../criminal_law/criminal_trial/maximum_fines_on_summary_conviction.html">class
C fine</a> or to imprisonment for a maximum of 12 months, or both.</p>

<h3>Monitoring sex offenders from other jurisdictions in Ireland</h3>

<p>A provision was included in the Sex Offenders Act, 2001 to ensure that
Ireland would not become a safe-haven for sex offenders convicted outside
Ireland who might seek to avoid the reporting requirements imposed on them by
the place of conviction.</p>

<p>Anyone who is convicted of a sexual offence in another country and who later
moves to Ireland is subject to a reporting requirement in the same way as
someone convicted in Ireland, provided that the sexual crime corresponds to a
sexual crime in Ireland which gives rise to the reporting requirements. There
is also a notification requirement where the person is already subject to a
similar reporting requirement under the law of the place of conviction. Such
people are required to notify the Gardaí if they have been resident in Ireland
for 7 days.</p>

<p>In reality the Gardaí in Ireland have a very good system of receiving and
giving information from and to police forces through <a shape="rect" href="http://www.interpol.int/">Interpol</a>. There is worldwide acceptance
that police forces have a duty of care to all citizens to share such
information on sex offenders where there is a real danger to vulnerable people
if exposed to such persons. </p>

<h3>Employment</h3>

<p>The Sex Offenders Act, 2001 also places requires sex offenders to inform
prospective employers of the nature of their conviction when applying to do
work that consists mainly of the offender having unsupervised access to or
contact with a child or children or a mentally impaired person. If someone
fails to notify an employer the offender could be fined up to €12,697 or
sentenced up to 5 years in prison or both.</p>

<h3>Can I find out if a sex offender lives in my area?</h3>

<p>No. The details held by the Gardaí in relation to those persons guilty of
sex offences and who are subject to the requirements of the Sex Offenders Act
2001 are not subject to <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/freedom_of_information.html">freedom
of information</a> legislation. You are not entitled, therefore, to apply under
the Freedom of Information Acts to find out details of sex offenders living in
your area.</p>

<p>Under the Data Protection Acts, 1988-2003 you are entitled to request
information held about yourself on computer or in manual or paper files. This
includes information held by the Gardaí (with a number of exceptions). Under
the data protection legislation, however, the only person entitled to request
this information held about you is yourself. It is not possible for you to make
such a request in respect of another person. Further information on <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/data_protection.html">Data
Protection in Ireland is available here</a>.</p>

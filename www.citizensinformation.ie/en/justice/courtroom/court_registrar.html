<p>The Court Registrar usually sits on a slightly raised platform below the <a shape="rect" href="judge.html">judge</a> facing the court. They do not wear any
special clothes in court, although sometimes in the High Court if the Registrar
happens to also be a <a shape="rect" href="barristers.html">barrister</a>, they
will wear barrister's robes. </p>

<p>Court Registrars are public servants and they are recruited directly from
the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/government_departments/the_civil_service.html">civil
service</a>. </p>

<p>The Registrar's main function is to assist the judge:</p>
<ul><li>The Registrar has a list of all the cases before the court for the day.
    They call out each case in turn so that the parties can identify themselves
    to the court. </li>
  <li>When a witness is called in a case, it is the Registrar who hands the
    witness the Bible and reads out the oath for the witness to repeat </li>
  <li>The Registrar keeps the court documents (writs, etc.) for each case and
    hands them to the judge as each case is called </li>
  <li>When the court makes an order, the Registrar keeps a note of the order
  </li>
  <li>After the day in court, the Registrar drafts the orders that the judge
    has made that day and keeps a record of those orders </li>
  <li>The Registrar generally deals with the administration necessary for the
    smooth running of the courts. </li>

<p>The jury fulfils a very important function in the legal system. You are
entitled to be tried by jury inless the alleged offence is a minor one or one
that is being tried in the <a shape="rect" href="../courts_system/special_criminal_court.html">Special Criminal Court</a>.
However, a jury is not required in every legal case. There will be a jury in
some civil cases such as defamation and assault cases. However, for the
majority of civil cases such as personal injuries actions and family law cases,
there is no jury - it is the <a shape="rect" href="judge.html">judge</a> who
decides the outcome. </p>

<p>The jury consists of 12 members of the public who sit in a box to one side
of the judge. One of the jurors is selected as a foreman of the jury by the
members of the jury before the case starts. He or she acts as an informal
chairperson and spokesperson for the jury. </p>

<p>The 12 jurors in a case are selected from a number of people who have been
called to do their jury service on that day. </p>

<p>Section 23 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/act/pub/0032/sec0023.html#sec23">Courts
and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013</a> amended the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1976/en/act/pub/0004/index.html">Juries
Act 1976</a> so that the jury can consist of up to 15 members, if the case is
expected to last more than 2 months.</p>

<p>The jurors are charged with the responsibility of deciding whether, on the
facts of the case, a person is guilty or not guilty of the offence for which he
or she has been charged. </p>

<p>The jury must reach its verdict by considering only the <a shape="rect" href="../evidence/evidence_introduction.html">evidence</a> introduced in court
and the directions of the judge. The jury does not interpret the law. It
follows the directions of the judge as regards legal matters.</p>

<p>During all stages of the trial, jurors may take notes of proceedings. Jurors
may also pass notes to the foreman or forewoman of the jury to ask the judge to
explain certain aspects of the case.</p>

<h3>The verdict </h3>

<p>At the conclusion of the trial, the jurors are given an issue paper, which
states the issues that the jury must consider in reaching its verdict. When a
jury consists of more than 12 members, only 12 are selected to consider the
verdict.</p>

<p>A Court Garda or other official is required to keep the jury together until
the verdict is reached. The jury is taken into the jury room and allowed no
outside communication at all, with the exception of notes to the Court
Registrar. They may keep a copy of the indictment, the exhibits and their
notes. </p>

<p>Jurors may send out notes asking for the law to be further explained or for
the judge to remind them of the details of the evidence. They will then be
brought back into the court for the judge to give them such assistance as
he/she can but there can be no new evidence at this stage.</p>

<p>In reaching its verdict in a <a href="../criminal_law/criminal_trial/criminal_trial.html">criminal
trial</a>, the jury must be satisfied that the person is guilty <em>beyond
reasonable doubt</em>. Beyond reasonable doubt means that if there are two
reasons given in the case and both are possible explanations for what happened,
taken together with the evidence presented, the jury should give the person the
benefit of the doubt and decide on a verdict of not guilty. </p>

<p>If the case is a civil one, the jury must be satisfied with its verdict on
the balance of probabilities.</p>

<p>It is not necessary that a jury be unanimous in its verdict. In a criminal
case, a verdict need not be unanimous where there are not fewer than 11 jurors
if 10 of them agree on a verdict after considering the case for a reasonable
time (not less than two hours). In a civil trial, a verdict may be reached by a
majority of 9 of the 12 members.</p>

<p>When the jury has reached its decision, it will return to the court and the
verdict will be read out by the foreman.</p>

<p>The jury has no role in <a href="../criminal_law/criminal_trial/sentence.html">sentencing</a>. This
decision is left up to the judge following submissions made by both sides.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Jurors must:</p>
<ul><li>Decide the facts of the case only </li>
  <li>Take directions relating to law from the trial judge, whether or not they
    agree with him/her </li>
  <li>Remain impartial and independent </li>
  <li>Remain uninfluenced by any person. It is an offence for any person who is
    not a member of the jury to attempt to influence a juror in any way. If any
    person speaks to a juror about the case, the juror should inform the court
    or a member of the Gardai.</li>
  <li>Keep statements made in the jury room confidential. Jurors should not
    discuss the case with any person other than members of the jury. It is
    contempt of court punishable by fine and/or imprisonment to repeat any
    statements made in the jury room. </li>

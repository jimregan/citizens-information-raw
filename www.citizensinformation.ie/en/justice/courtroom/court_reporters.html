<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2> <p>Court reporters are usually employed by newspaper and legal reports companies. They attend in court to take a note of interesting or important
cases and to report them in the newspapers or in the legal reports. </p>
<p>Court reporters may sit anywhere in court and they do not wear any
special clothes. They do not play any role in the proceedings - they are simply
there to take notes and report about cases. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>A solicitor is a type of lawyer. To become a solicitor, you must complete an
apprenticeship of at least 2 years and you must pass exams set by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.lawsociety.ie/">Law Society</a> at Blackhall
Place in Dublin. (See 'how to apply' below).</p>

<p>Solicitors have a very wide range of different functions:</p>
<ul><li>A solicitor may give legal advice about non-contentious matters, such as
    <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/owning_a_home/buying_a_home/steps_involved_buying_a_home.html">buying
    a house or flat</a> or <a shape="rect" href="/en/death/before_a_death/making_a_will.html">drafting a will</a> </li>
  <li>A solicitor may act as your agent or representative in commercial
    transactions </li>
  <li>Your solicitor may also give you legal advice and represent you in
    relation to a dispute or disagreement that you have with another party, for
    example, a family dispute or a dispute with your employer or your neighbour
  </li>
  <li>A solicitor may give you legal advice about taking or defending a case.
    If you have been involved in an accident, for example, a road traffic
    accident or an accident at work. </li>
  <li>If you are involved in a court case, your solicitor will manage the case
    and represent you when dealing with the other party. For example, your
    solicitor will send letters to the other side on your behalf. Your
    solicitor will file all of the necessary court documents and contact the <a shape="rect" href="the_role_of_witnesses.html">witnesses</a> for the case.
  </li>
  <li>If it is necessary to involve a <a shape="rect" href="barristers.html">barrister</a> in the case, your solicitor will
    "brief" the barrister by sending him/her all of the necessary documents and
    information </li>
  <li>Your solicitor may also actually represent you in court, although in the
    <a shape="rect" href="../courts_system/high_court.html">High Court</a> and
    the <a shape="rect" href="../courts_system/supreme_court.html">Supreme
    Court</a>, a barrister will usually be engaged. </li>
</ul><p>Unlike barristers, solicitors are allowed to join together to form
partnerships or companies and they are allowed to advertise their services. </p>

<p>Solicitors do not have to wear any special clothes when in court. If there
is a barrister involved in the case, the solicitor will usually sit facing the
barrister in the bench under the <a shape="rect" href="judge.html">judge</a>.
If the barrister needs a matter to be clarified, he or she can then lean over
to ask the solicitor. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The Law Society sets down rules and regulations about how solicitors may
conduct their business. There is a Disciplinary Tribunal, which can investigate
any allegations of misconduct made against a solicitor. </p>

<p>Read more about <a shape="rect" href="http://www.lawsociety.ie/Pages/Public-Make-a-Complaint-CMS/">making a
complaint about a solicitor in Ireland here</a>.</p>

<p>Complaints about solicitors provided by the Legal Aid Board should be made
as per the <a href="http://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/About-the-Board/Customer-Charter/Complaints-Procedure/">Legal
Aid Board's complaints procedure</a>. </p>

<p>In December 2015, the Oireachtas passed the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/65/enacted/en/html">Legal
Services Regulation Act 2015</a> which provides for, <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR15000646">among other things</a>,
an independent complaints regime.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Solicitors' rates and fees vary greatly. Your solicitor <span>is under an
obligation</span> to explain to you how much his or her fees will be before you
engage him or her to act on your behalf. </p>

<p>Many solicitors take on cases on a "no foal, no fee" basis. This means that
you will not be charged a fee by your solicitor if you do not win the case.
This is most common in personal injuries cases, i.e., where you have been
injured in an accident. </p>

<p>You can read more about solicitor's fees in the Law Society's leaflet: <a shape="rect" href="https://www.lawsociety.ie/Documents/pdfs/LegalCharges.pdf">Information in
relation to legal charges (pdf)</a>.</p>

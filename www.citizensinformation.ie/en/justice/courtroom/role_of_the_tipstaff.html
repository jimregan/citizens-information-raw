<p>Each <a shape="rect" href="judge.html">judge</a> in Ireland has a personal
		  assistant in court called a "tipstaff". He or she wears a black gown
		  and when he or she is in court, he or she usually sits on a chair at one side
		  of the judge. One of his/her duties is to announce the arrival and departure of the judge from the courtroom. </p>
<p>The tipstaff's main function is to provide general assistance to
		  the judge: </p>
<ul><li>The tipstaff accompanies the judge while the judge is
			 carrying out his or her duties. In the
			 <a shape="rect" href="../courts_system/high_court.html">High Court</a> and the
			 <a shape="rect" href="../courts_system/supreme_court.html">Supreme Court</a>, the
			 tipstaff holds a long wooden staff when he or she is bringing the judge from
			 chambers to the court and back. </li>
<li>The tipstaff communicates with the other tipstaffs to keep
			 the judge informed about what is happening in other courts on a day-to-day
			 basis. </li>
<li>If the judge wishes to communicate a message to another
			 court, needs a book or needs another errand to be carried out, he or she may
			 ask his or her tipstaff for assistance. </li>

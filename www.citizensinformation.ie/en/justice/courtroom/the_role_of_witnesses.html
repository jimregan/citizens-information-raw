<p>Witnesses in Ireland are people who have been called to give <a shape="rect" href="../evidence/evidence_introduction.html">evidence</a> in court. </p>

<p>The witness's name is called and they go into the witness box at one side of
the judge. They stand in the witness box to repeat the <a shape="rect" href="../witnesses/the_procedure_for_being_a_witness.html">oath or
affirmation</a> and then sit down. </p>

<p>The witness is then asked a series of questions by the <a shape="rect" href="barristers.html">barristers</a> (or <a shape="rect" href="solicitors.html">solicitors</a>) in the case. The witness's function is
to give evidence to the court. For example, the witness may have seen a robbery
take place and may be able to tell the court what they saw. This evidence may
help the <a shape="rect" href="judge.html">judge</a> or the <a shape="rect" href="jury.html">jury</a> to make its decision. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../witnesses/witnesses_introduction.html">Further
information about being a witness in a court case in Ireland</a> is available
in our section on Witnesses. </p>

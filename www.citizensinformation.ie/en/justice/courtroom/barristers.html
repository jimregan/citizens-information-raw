<p>A barrister (also called "counsel") is a type of lawyer who specialises in
court advocacy and the giving of legal opinion. </p>

<p>To become a barrister, you must pass the exams set by the Kings Inns. (The
Kings Inns is the body which governs entry to the profession of
barrister-at-law in Ireland). After you have passed your exams, you must be
"called to the Bar" and you must complete a year of "devilling", which is a
form of apprenticeship for barristers. </p>

<p>Barristers must wear white collars and a black gown in most courts. They may
also wear a wig. In certain courts, such as the family law courts and the
children's court, barristers do not wear the wig and gown. </p>

<p>Barristers are not allowed to set up "chambers" or partnerships together.
Each barrister is self-employed and works as an individual. In December 2015,
the Oireachtas passed the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/65/enacted/en/html">Legal
Services Regulation Act 2015</a> which provides for, <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR15000646">among other things</a>,
new business models for legal practitioners including barrister/barrister and
barrister/solicitor partnerships and multi-disciplinary practices.</p>

<h3>Functions of a barrister</h3>

<p>Barristers have a wide range of different functions:</p>
<ul><li>Barristers draft legal opinions. For example, a barrister might give you
    a legal opinion on whether or not you have a good legal case against
    someone with whom you have had a dispute. </li>
  <li>The barrister will then write the legal documents (<a shape="rect" href="../civil_law/writs_and_pleadings_introduction.html">writs or
    pleadings</a>) which must be filed in the case. </li>
  <li>When the case comes to trial, it is the barrister who will represent you
    in court, speak on your behalf and argue your case before the judge. </li>
  <li>Your barrister may also be the person who negotiates a settlement of your
    case instead of it going to trial. </li>
</ul><h3>Engaging a barrister</h3>

<p>Barristers are <span>not contacted directly by the public</span> - they are
engaged by solicitors to work on a case. When you contact a solicitor for legal
advice, your solicitor may recommend that a barrister be engaged to provide
services. </p>

<p>If you and your solicitor decide to involve a barrister in your case, the
solicitor will send the barrister a brief containing all the relevant
information and documents to assist the barrister in the presentation of the
case. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

    attention to within a reasonable time</li>

  <li>A barrister has duties towards the courts and they cannot mislead a court
    in any way</li>

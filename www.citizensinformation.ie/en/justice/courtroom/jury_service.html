<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Most non-minor criminal offences require a <a href="../criminal_law/criminal_trial/criminal_trial.html">trial by a judge
and jury</a>. Some civil cases, for example, defamation, require a jury trial.
Information on what jurors do is available in our document on <a href="jury.html">the role of a jury</a>.</p>

<p>Jurors are contacted by summons of the County Registrar, which will state
that you are obliged to attend for jury service on a particular date.</p>

</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l2c8a9">Selection of jurors</h2>

<p>As mentioned above jurors are contacted by summons of the County Registrar.
You must reply to the jury summons by using the form and pre-paid envelope
provided. If you come within the categories of persons excusable from jury
service as of right, you must state that fact on the form provided.</p>

<p>If you wish to be excused for another reason (such as illness), you must
state that reason and the County Registrar will make a decision as to whether
or not you may be excused.</p>

<h3>In court</h3>

<p>All the jury members summonsed that are not excused must attend in court on
the first day the panel is formed. The name of every juror is called out and
you must answer to show you are in attendance.</p>

<p>In order to select a panel of 12 jurors for a particular case, names are
drawn out of a ballot box. If your name is called, you will go to the jury box
and you will be given an opportunity to state if you are ineligible for or
disqualified from jury service or if you know any of the witnesses in the
case.</p>

<p>Section 23 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/act/pub/0032/sec0023.html#sec23">Courts
and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013</a> amended the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1976/en/act/pub/0004/index.html">Juries
Act 1976</a> so that the jury can consist of up to 15 members, if the case is
expected to last more than 2 months.</p>

<p>Even though you are called for jury service, you may not actually serve.
Usually more people than necessary are called. You must return to court every
day, whether or not you are sworn onto a jury panel, unless otherwise directed
by the court.</p>

<p>Before you give your oath, either side in the case may challenge you. This
is simply an objection to a proposed juror. Each side may challenge 7 potential
jurors without giving any reason and may challenge any number of jurors if they
can "show cause". </p>

<p>If you are challenged without reason being given, you will leave the jury
box. If you are challenged with reason, it is the judge who decides whether or
not you will serve.</p>

<p>The members of the jury who have been selected will individually swear an
oath or affirm that they will properly try the issue and give a true verdict
according to the evidence.</p>

<p>When the jury is sworn in and before the case starts, it will select a
foreman from its members. The foreman acts as an informal chairperson and
spokesperson of the jury.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="le4155">Payment on jury service</h2>

<p>There is <span>no payment</span> for jury service. <span>Travelling
expenses</span> are <span>not allowed</span>. If you are actually serving as a
juror, lunch will be provided on the day or days that the trial is at
hearing.</p>

<p>If you are self-employed and work alone and where your attendance at jury
service may mean you cannot earn a living, you may qualify for excusal from
jury service. Contact the jury office of the Court for more information. </p>

<p>If you are signing on for a Jobseeker's payment you will continue to be
paid, but you should advise your local Social Welfare Office that you have been
called for jury service.</p>

<p>If you are in employment, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1976/en/act/pub/0004/index.html">Juries
Act 1976</a> (<a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1976/en/act/pub/0004/sec0029.html#zza4y1976s29">Section
29</a>) places a duty on your employer to allow you attend for jury service. It
is further specified in the law that time spent on jury service is to be
treated as if the employee were actually employed. In other words, if you are
in employment and are attending for jury service, <span>you are entitled to be
paid while you are away from work</span>. Anyone with a contract of employment
(i.e., temporary workers, contract workers, etc.) is entitled to be paid by
their employer while they are on jury service. There should also be no loss of
any other employment rights while you serve on a jury. The Jury office will
provide a certificate of attendance on request.</p>

<p>If you feel your employment rights have been infringed or you have lost
employment rights while serving on a jury, you can make a complaint to the
Workplace Relations Commission using the online complaint form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Referring-a-Dispute/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.

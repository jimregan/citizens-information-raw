<p>The court stenographer in a courtroom, usually sits on a slightly raised
platform under the <a shape="rect" href="judge.html">judge</a>, near the <a shape="rect" href="court_registrar.html">court registrar</a>. He or she does
not wear any special clothes in court. </p>

<p>The stenographer keeps a verbatim written record (in realtime if needed), of
what is said during a trial. They use a machine like a typewriter, which allows
him/her to record an account of everything that is said during the trial. </p>

<p>Stenographers in Irish courtrooms are employed by private companies. In many
cases, such as criminal, commercial and family law cases, the State pays for
the stenographer to be present. In other cases, such as personal injuries
cases, it is up to the parties to engage and pay the stenographer to be
present. </p>

<p>The main reason why a written account is kept of the proceedings is to
assist the parties if they wish to appeal the judge's decision at a later
stage. After the trial has ended, the stenographer will transcribe everything
that has been recorded into "transcripts", which can be made available to all
the parties in the case and the judge. </p>

<p>The transcripts they create are often crucial in analysing the daily
progress of a case, and they serve as a basis for appeal. More and more trials
and tribunals require instant text translation of a stenographer's notes or an
immediate transcript of the evidence. This is now provided by the court
stenographer because technological advances in his or her shorthand method and
the equipment now makes immediate transcripts of evidence possible.</p>

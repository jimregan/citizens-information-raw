<p>You may be called to give evidence as a witness in a <a shape="rect" href="../criminal_law/criminal_trial/criminal_trial.html">criminal case</a> or
a <a shape="rect" href="../civil_law/taking_a_civil_case_intro.html">civil
case</a>. </p>

<h3>Eye-witnesses</h3>

<p>You may be called as an "eye-witness" if you personally witnessed something
happen that is relevant to the case. You may be called by either side in the
case, whether it is a criminal case or a civil case. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="the_procedure_for_being_a_witness.html">When you take
the stand</a>, a Bible will be handed to you and you will repeat the oath or
affirmation that you will "tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
truth". You will then be asked a series of questions to allow you to describe
what you witnessed. </p>

<p>Your evidence as an "eye-witness" will be confined to the facts, i.e. what
you actually saw, rather than any inferences or assumptions you have made from
what you saw. You will then be cross-examined by the other side. </p>

<h3>Expert witnesses</h3>

<p>You may be called as an "expert witness" by either side in a case about a
matter that is outside the ordinary knowledge of the judge or jury. For
example, you may be called as a handwriting expert or as a doctor to give an
opinion on something that is relevant to the case. </p>

<p>Your opinion is accepted as evidence because you are an expert on the
subject and because the court does not have the knowledge or expertise itself
to form a reliable opinion on the facts. </p>

<p>As an expert witness, you must also take the oath or affirmation. You will
then be asked to explain why you are an expert in the particular area, i.e. to
outline your qualifications or work experience. You will then be asked a series
of questions to allow you to give your opinion about certain facts. Finally,
you will be cross-examined by the other side. </p>

<h3>Character witnesses</h3>

<p>There are different situations where you may be called as a "character
witness": </p>
<ul><li>You may be called as a character witness to give evidence of the good
    character of the accused in a criminal case. You will take the oath or
    affirmation and you will then be asked a series of questions to allow you
    to describe the accused. The purpose of your evidence is to show that the
    accused is less likely to have committed the offence because he or she is a
    person of good character. </li>
  <li>You may be called as a character witness to give evidence of the good
    character of a person who has already been convicted of a criminal offence.
    The purpose of your evidence is to help the judge decide which <a shape="rect" href="../criminal_law/criminal_trial/sentence.html">sentence</a> to impose.
  </li>
  <li>You may be called as a character witness to give evidence about the good
    or bad character of a party in a civil trial if that party's character is
    an important issue in the case. For example, in a defamation case where a
    newspaper stated that a person was a "rogue", you may be called to give
    evidence about an incident you witnessed that tends to show that the person
    in question was of dubious character. </li>
</ul><p>You will make the oath or affirmation and then you will be asked a series of
questions to allow you describe what you know of the party's character. You
will then be cross-examined by the other side.</p>

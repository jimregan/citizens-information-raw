<p>The general rule in Irish law regarding competence of witnesses is that all
human beings are competent witnesses. In other words, everyone is capable of
giving evidence in a case. However, there are some exceptions. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>The co-accused</h3>

<p>Sometimes two or more people may be charged with a criminal offence and they
are tried at the same time. In that situation, the people being tried are
called "co-accuseds" and the rule is that one co-accused cannot be called by
the prosecution to give evidence against another co-accused. </p>

<h3>The spouse of the accused</h3>

<p>Originally the spouse of an accused was not competent to testify for either
side in a case. However, the law has now changed and a spouse may give evidence
for either the defence or the prosecution (unless he or she happens to be a
co-accused). He or she may only be forced to testify for the prosecution
against his or her spouse in <a shape="rect" href="who_can_be_forced_to_be_a_witness.html">certain circumstances</a>. </p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>Originally children could only give evidence on oath and in order to take
the oath, the child had to understand the nature and consequences of the oath.
</p>

<p>Since the introduction of Sections 27 and 28 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0012/index.html">Criminal
Evidence Act 1992</a> for <a shape="rect" href="../criminal_law/criminal_trial/criminal_trial.html">criminal
proceedings</a> and Section 28 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0040/index.html">Children
Act 1997</a> for <a shape="rect" href="../civil_law/taking_a_civil_case_intro.html">civil proceedings</a>, any
court can accept evidence from a child under 14 years of age without the child
taking the oath. The court must be satisfied that the child is capable of
giving an intelligible account of what he/she witnessed. Even though such
evidence is not on oath, the child is guilty of an offence if he/she knowingly
gives evidence which is false or untrue.</p>

<p>In cases where a child under 14 years is offered as a witness by the
prosecution, it is not unusual for the judge to request to talk to the child in
private before the child gives evidence, in order to assess the child's ability
and capacity to give an intelligible account of events. This normally takes the
form of a general conversation with the child but does not involve the judge
asking questions about the evidence the child is about to give.</p>

<p>Children over 14 years of age must still make the oath or affirmation in
order to give evidence. </p>

<h3>People with mental disabilities</h3>

<p>People with mental disabilities are dealt with in the exact same way as
children under 14 years of age. Under the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 and the
Children Act 1997 if a court is satisfied that a person with a mental
disability is capable of giving an intelligible account of the events which are
relevant to the proceedings then the court may receive that evidence from the
person without the oath.</p>

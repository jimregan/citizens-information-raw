<p>You may be called as a witness in a <a shape="rect" href="../criminal_law/criminal_trial/criminal_trial.html">criminal case</a> or
a <a shape="rect" href="../civil_law/taking_a_civil_case_intro.html">civil
case</a>. The general rule is that everyone is <a shape="rect" href="competence_of_a_witness.html">competent</a> and can be <a shape="rect" href="who_can_be_forced_to_be_a_witness.html">compelled</a> to be a witness.
</p>

<p>Before the trial of the case, you may be contacted by legal representatives
for the party who wishes to call you as a witness. </p>

<p>They may wish to obtain a written statement from you about what happened
and/or they may wish to meet with you to discuss it. </p>

<h3>The Summons or Subpoena</h3>

<p>If a party in a court case wishes to call you as a witness, you will receive
a "witness summons" or a "subpoena". This is a simple court form that sets out:
</p>
<ul><li>The name of the case</li>
  <li>The date and time that the case will be heard</li>
  <li>The place (the court) where you must attend</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you have received a summons or subpoena, you must attend on the date in
question at the court. If you fail to do so, you can be imprisoned for
"contempt of court". It is not a good defence for you to say that you are
intimidated by one of the parties in the case or afraid to give evidence. </p>

<p>If you have to take time off work in order to attend court, you are not
entitled to be paid while away from work. You may be entitled to witness
expenses (see below).</p>

<p>If your employer wants you to take the time off work as <a href="../../employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/annual_leave_public_holidays.html">annual
leave</a>, the normal conditions for taking annual leave apply. Your employer
must take into account your family responsibilities, opportunities for rest and
recreation that are available to you and to consult with you at least one month
before the leave is to be taken.</p>

<p>If you receive a "subpoena duces tecum", it will state that you must not
only attend in court but you must also bring along specified documents.</p>

<h3>Witness expenses</h3>

<p>As a court witness, you may be entitled to witness expenses. </p>

<p>If you are a witness for the prosecution in a criminal trial, you should
tell the investigating Garda who is dealing with the case what your expenses
are. For example, you may miss out on wages for the days that you are in court
and you may incur travel expenses to get to court. </p>

<p>The Garda will then make an application to the judge that witness expenses
should be paid and if the judge makes an order, you will be given a cheque for
your expenses. </p>

<p>If you are a witness for the defence in a criminal trial, you may also be
entitled to recover some of your witness expenses. You should tell the
solicitor who has summonsed you to come to court what your expenses are. </p>

<p>If you are a witness in a civil trial, you will normally be entitled to
recover any out-of-pocket expenses you have incurred as a result of having to
give evidence. You should speak to the solicitor who has summonsed you to court
and he or she will apply for expenses on your behalf. Normally all the witness
expenses are paid by the party who has lost the civil case as the losing party
will usually be ordered to pay the costs of both sides. </p>

<p>Expert witnesses such as doctors and psychiatrists are entitled to be paid a
set fee for giving evidence, whether it is a criminal or a civil trial. They
are also paid for the reports that they write for the purposes of the case.</p>

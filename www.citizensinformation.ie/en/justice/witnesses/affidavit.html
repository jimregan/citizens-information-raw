<p>An affidavit is a written sworn statement from a witness in a case. It is a
document that sets out in paragraph form the evidence that the witness wishes
to give. Affidavits are usually written and prepared by a <a shape="rect" href="../courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a> or a <a shape="rect" href="../courtroom/barristers.html">barrister</a> after having obtained all the
necessary information from the witness. The wording used in the affidavit will
depend on the circumstances of the case. Your solicitor can give you more
information on the wording that will be used. </p>

<p>When the affidavit is ready, the witness must go before a <a shape="rect" href="../civil_law/commissioners_for_oaths.html">Commissioner for Oaths</a>.
The Commissioner for Oaths will check that the person swearing the oath has
read the affidavit and fully understands the contents. The witness will be
asked to raise the Bible and to repeat the words of the oath. If the witness
does not wish to swear an oath on the Bible, he or she may make an affirmation.
He or she will then sign the affidavit. </p>

<p>The Commissioner for Oaths will verify that the affidavit was properly sworn
by completing a <em>jurat</em> on the affidavit. It may then be submitted as
evidence to the court by lodging it in the appropriate court office and sending
a duplicate to the other party in the case. </p>

<p>Some cases do not involve an oral hearing with witnesses giving evidence in
court. Those cases may be dealt with by affidavit only. For example, if the
Plaintiff issues a <a shape="rect" href="../civil_law/originating_summons.html">summary summons</a>, it will be
accompanied by an affidavit setting out the facts of the case. The Defendant
may then respond by affidavit. The judge may be able to decide the case by
simply reading the affidavits. This is a swifter and less expensive procedure.

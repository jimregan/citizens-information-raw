<p>The general rule in the courts in Ireland, is that a witness must be present
in the courtroom to give oral evidence. However, recent legislation, <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0012/sec0013.html">Section
13 of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992</a>, has introduced the concept of
video-link evidence in cases. </p>

<p>Instead of coming into the courtroom, the witness sits in another room and
gives evidence via a live television link. A television monitor is placed in
the court, which transmits the image of the witness, and the witness has the
benefit of a television monitor in his/her room that transmits the image of
what is going on in the court. </p>

<p>The purpose of TV-link evidence is to make it easier for some witnesses to
give evidence. The courtroom can be very intimidating and being in the same
room as the accused may be very difficult for some witnesses. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>In criminal proceedings, there are few situations where TV-link evidence
will be acceptable:</p>
<ul><li>If a witness lives outside Ireland, in some cases, he or she may give
    evidence through a live television link </li>
  <li>If the proceedings relate to a sexual or violent offence, the judge may
    decide that any witness (other than the accused) may give evidence through
    a live TV link </li>
  <li>If the proceedings relate to a sexual or violent offence, <a shape="rect" href="witnesses_under_17_years.html">witnesses under 18 years of age</a>
    and people with mental disabilities are allowed give evidence by live TV
    link unless there is a good reason why they should not </li>
</ul><p>When evidence is being given by a child or a person with a mental disability
through a live TV link, the judge and the barristers in the court do not wear
wigs or gowns. The judge may decide that the questions should be asked through
an intermediary (for example a social worker) and that they should be asked in
a way that is appropriate for the age and mental ability of the witness. </p>

<p>In civil proceedings there is provision to allow someone to give evidence
through a live TV link, including where the witness is not in Ireland,
providing the facilities are availble and the case is suitable.</p>

<p>Video-link evidence may also be allowed in civil cases concerning the
welfare of a child or a person with a mental disability. The judge must decide
that it is appropriate that the child or person with a mental disability give
evidence by a television link and he or she may also decide that the questions
should be put through an intermediary.</p>

<p>A hostile witness is a witness who at some point after the person has been
sworn in to give evidence in court, appears unwilling to tell the truth.
Normally, the party that calls you as a witness does so in the belief that you
will provide the court with evidence similar to the account you provided
earlier in a pre-trial statement. If you do not give the evidence expected,
very little can be done. If, however, you go further and start telling lies or
refuse to answer questions, the party who called you can apply to the judge to
have you declared a <em>hostile witness</em>. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>When your evidence under oath begins to change materially from the account
that you provided earlier in a pre-trial statement, the counsel or barrister
calling you can apply to the judge for a decision as to whether or not you are
hostile. This application must be made to the judge in the absence of the <a shape="rect" href="../courtroom/jury_service.html">jury</a>. The judge decides
(largely on your demeanour and credibility) whether or not to treat you as a
hostile witness. </p>

<p>The judge also has to distinguish between a hostile witness and an
unfavourable witness. Just because you give unhelpful or unfavourable evidence
it does not mean the party calling you can attack your credibility.</p>

<h3>What happens if I am ruled as a hostile witness?</h3>

<p>Normally, if a counsel or barrister calls you as a witness, the calling
barrister is not permitted to attack your credibility or cross-examine you as
if you were a witness for the other side. He/she cannot ask questions about, or
introduce evidence of, your bad character, past convictions, prior inconsistent
statements or bias. Also, the calling barrister cannot ask leading questions to
get you to say what the barrister wants.</p>

<p>Where you are ruled as hostile, the barrister calling you may:</p>
<ul><li>Cross-examine you </li>
  <li>Ask leading questions in an effort to get you to say what they want. </li>
  <li>Cross-examine you on your previous statement made before the trial. </li>
</ul><p>If you are cross-examined on your previous statement, that statement is only
evidence of your inconsistency and is not proof of the facts contained in the
statement. </p>

<p>For more detailed information you should seek legal advice.<br></p>

<h3>Procedure followed when a witness is declared hostile </h3>

<p>The following is a summary of the procedure that is adopted when a witness
is accused of contradicting his/her previous statement while in the witness
box: </p>
<ul><li>Counsel or barrister makes an application to the judge in the absence of
    the jury and puts before the judge the statement upon which it is sought to
    have the witness declared a hostile witness. </li>
  <li>If the judge rules that the witness may be treated as a hostile witness,
    in the presence of the jury it is put to the witness that the witness had
    previously made a statement which differed materially from, or contradicted
    the one he/she was making in the witness box. </li>
  <li>If the witness denies this, the witness is then asked to stand down from
    the witness box. </li>
  <li>To prove that the witness made the statement, the Garda who took the
    statement goes into the witness box and proves to the judge that the
    statement was made (without revealing the contents of the statement). </li>
  <li>The witness is then asked to go back into the witness box and the
    statement is shown to the witness for identification. The witness’s
    attention is drawn to the part of the statement in which the contradiction
    or difference occurs. </li>
  <li>If the witness agrees that there is a contradiction or difference between
    the statement and his/her evidence to the court, then that is the end of
    the matter in relation to discrediting the witness’s credibility. </li>
  <li>If, however, the witness persists in denying the contradiction, then the
    statement is read into evidence, that is, read to the jury as proof of the
    fact that the witness made a contradictory or different statement, to the
    evidence the witness offered while in the witness-box. </li>
  <li>Where the statement is read into evidence, the judge must make it clear
    to the jury that what the witness has said in the <em>written</em>
    statement is not evidence of the facts in the statement, but only evidence
    relating to the credibility of the witness.</li>

<p>Children and young people who are required to go to court as witnesses are
most often either the victims of crime or witnesses to crimes. Going to court
is regarded by most people as a daunting prospect and children and young people
may feel anxious about the prospect and will need extra support and reassurance
from parents, guardians or carers in advance of and during this time. </p>

<p>Cases at which children and young people can give evidence can be heard in
the <a shape="rect" href="../courts_system/district_court_criminal_juris.html">District Court</a>,
the <a shape="rect" href="../courts_system/circuit_court_criminal_juris.html">Circuit Court</a> or
the Central Criminal Court. </p>

<p>Before a child or young person is required to go to court to give evidence,
it is important to explain the several steps involved in taking a case to
court. </p>

<h3>The Gardaí</h3>

<p>A complaint is made to the Gardaí that identifies the child or young person
as a victim of, or witness to, a crime. A Garda officer then interviews the
child or young person. </p>

<p>Following consideration of all the allegations made, the Gardaí may decide
to:</p>
<ul><li>Interview the defendant about what the child or young person has said and
    send the file to the Director of Public Prosecutions, or </li>
  <li>Arrest the defendant on warrant, or </li>
  <li>Charge the defendant with an offence or </li>
  <li>Issue a summons for the defendant to appear in court. </li>
</ul><h3>The Director of Public Prosecutions</h3>

<p>The Gardaí inform the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP)
about the case and provide information as to how the child or young person and
their parents/guardians/carers feel about the child or young person giving
evidence in court. </p>

<p>The DPP makes an independent decision about whether or not to proceed with
the prosecution, which means that the child or young person may or may not be
required to give evidence. </p>

<h3>The court</h3>

<p>Criminal cases commence in the District Court where the judge sits without a
jury. Cases involving minor assaults are decided in the District Court. Cases
involving more serious assaults or serious offences against property are sent
forward for trial to the Circuit Court. Cases involving murder, rape,
aggravated sexual assault, treason, piracy, etc., must be heard in the Central
Criminal Court. In both the Circuit and Central Criminal Courts, the judge sits
with a jury. </p>

<p>If a witness is 14 years of age or over, he/she will be required to give
evidence on oath or affirmation. Children under 14 years are not required to
swear an oath or make an affirmation before giving evidence. </p>

<p>In some cases involving sexual offences, the judge may decide that members
of the public should not be allowed in court.</p>

<p>If your child is appearing as a witness in court, it is important not to
rehearse the child's evidence. The case is likely to fail if the child appears
to have been "coached". The prosecution can give you more advice on this.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="ldc755">Giving evidence by video link</h2>

<p>In cases involving a sexual offence or an offence involving violence, <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0012/sec0013.html">Section
13 of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992</a> allows for children under 17 years of
age and people with intellectual disabilities to give evidence from a separate
room using a video link. unless there is a good reason why they should not. </p>

<p>Instead of coming into the courtroom, the witness sits in another room and
gives evidence via a live television link. A television monitor is placed in
the court, which transmits the image of the witness, and the witness has the
benefit of a television monitor in his/her room that transmits the image of
what is going on in the court. </p>

<p>This means that your child does not have to go into the courtroom or see the
defendant. When evidence is being given by a child through a live TV link, the
judge and the barristers in the court do not wear wigs or gowns. The judge may
decide that the questions should be asked through an intermediary (for example
a social worker) and that they should be asked in a way that is appropriate for
the age and mental ability of the witness.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l8200c">Video recording of statements</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0012/sec0016.html">Section
16 of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992</a> allows for video recording of
statements of victims under 14 years of age to be admitted as evidence in
criminal proceedings in relation to sexual offences or offences involving
violence. The law allows for the video recording of the statement to be
admitted in place of the child having to give live testimony (evidence) in open
court. This also removes the requirement of the child witness having to
physically confront and re-identify the accused in court.</p>

<p>There are a number of rules regarding the admissibility of this video
recording of statements.</p>
<ul><li>The video recording must be relevant. </li>
  <li>The child witness must be available for cross-examination by the defence
    at the trial following the playing of the tape (although cross-examination
    may be via <a shape="rect" href="giving_evidence_by_television_link.html">television link</a> and
    using an intermediary). </li>
  <li>The prosecution must serve notice of its intention to admit a videotaped
    interview in evidence and must give the accused a reasonable opportunity to
    view the videotape. </li>
  <li>An edited version of the videotape may be played to the court but only if
    the accused consents and the judge allows it. </li>
</ul><p>Ultimately, it is at the discretion of the trial judge whether to allow a
videotape to be admitted in evidence. The judge has to consider whether there
is any risk that the admission of the videotape will result in unfairness to
the accused. </p>

<p>The statements of victims under 14 years of age can be made during an
interview with a Garda or other <em>competent person</em>. The competent person
in such a situation would be the professional person who assesses the young
person as a result of an abuse case which is being investigated. </p>

<p>All the provisions which relate to the video-recording of statements made by
victims under 14 years of age and the admissibility of such videotapes in a
court also apply to any victim with an intellectual disability.</p>

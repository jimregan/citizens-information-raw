<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If the International Protection Office or the International Protection
Appeals Tribunal makes a recommendation to the Minister for Justice and
Equality that you should be given a refugee or subsidiary protection
declaration, the Minister will give you a declaration in writing stating that
you are a refugee or are eligible for subsidiary protection, subject to
considerations of national security or public order. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l11a7c">If you are given a declaration</h2>

<p>If the Minister decides to give you a refugee or subsidiary protection
declaration, in accordance with the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/enacted/en/html">International
Protection Act 2015</a>, you are then entitled to: </p>
<ul><li>Seek and enter employment in the State</li>
  <li>Carry on any business, trade or profession in the State</li>
  <li>Have access to education and training in the same manner and to the same
    extent in all respects as an Irish citizen</li>
  <li>Receive the same medical care and services and the same social welfare
    benefits as an Irish citizen</li>

  <li>Have the same rights of <a href="../refugee_status_and_leave_to_remain/travel_documents_for_refugees.html">travel

    that the Minister for Justice and Equality issues a travel document) </li>
  <li>Apply to the Minister for Justice and Equality for permission for a
    member of your family to enter and reside in the State, in accordance with
    <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/section/56/enacted/en/html#sec56">Section

</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l6ead1">If you are refused a declaration</h2>

<p>If the International Protection Office or the International Protection
Appeals Tribunal recommends to the Minister for Justice and Equality that you
should be refused a refugee or subsidiary protection declaration, the Minister
may refuse to give you a refugee or subsidiary protection declaration. You will
be sent a notice in writing stating that your application for a refugee or
subsidiary protection declaration has been refused. </p>

<h3>Voluntary return </h3>

<p>If your application for a refugee or subsidiary protection declaration has
been refused, the Minister may inform you in writing that you may withdraw your
application and return voluntarily to your country of origin. If you confirm to
the Minister that you will comply with this, the Minister will not make a
deportation order requiring you to leave the State. </p>

<h3>Permission to remain </h3>

<p>If the International Protection Office has made a recommendation that you
should be refused a refugee or subsidiary protection declaration, and this
recommendation has not been overturned by the International Protection Appeals
Tribunal, the Minister may consider whether you should be given permission to
remain in the State. When deciding this, under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/section/49/enacted/en/html#sec49">section
49</a> of the Act, the Minister must have regard to your family and personal
circumstances including your connection with the State (if any), humanitarian
considerations and considerations of national security and public order. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l7164e">If the Minister makes a deportation
order to remove you from the State</h2>

<p>If the Minister for Justice and Equality has refused to give you a refugee
or subsidiary protection declaration or permission to remain, the Minister may
make a deportation order against you in accordance with the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1999/en/act/pub/0022/index.html">Immigration
Act 1999</a>, as amended. The notice of the deportation order may require you
to leave the State within a specified period and to present yourself to a
member of the Garda Síochána or immigration officer at a date, time and place
as specified in the order. </p>

<p>Where an immigration officer or a member of An Garda Síochána, with
reasonable cause, suspects that a person against whom a deportation order is in
force:</p>
<ul><li>Has failed to comply with any provision of the order or with a
    requirement </li>
  <li>Intends to leave the State and enter another state illegally </li>
  <li>Has destroyed identity documents or is in possession of forged identity
    documents or </li>
  <li>Intends to avoid deportation </li>
</ul><p>The officer concerned may arrest that person without warrant and detain that
person in a prescribed place or may transport them to a ship, aircraft, road
vehicle or train that is due to leave the State. Under section 78 of the
International Protection Act 2015, for the purposes of arresting that person,
the officer may enter (using reasonable force if necessary) and search any
premises where the person is or where the officer suspects the person is. If it
is a dwelling, the officer will not enter without consent unless the person is
ordinarily resident there or the officer has reasonable grounds for believing
the person is there. </p>

is necessary to do so, the Minister may provide that the right to travel,
renewal of leave to remain in the State and/or family reunification shall not
apply to a person who has been given a refugee declaration or a subsidiary
protection declaration. </p>

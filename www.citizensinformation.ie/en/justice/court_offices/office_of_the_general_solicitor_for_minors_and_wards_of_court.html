<p>The General Solicitor for Minors and Wards of Court is a solicitor in the
service of the state appointed by the President of the High Court to act in
certain wardship matters. </p>

<p>The General Solicitor is accountable to the High Court for all monies and
assets under his/her control relating to the affairs of a minor or ward.The
General Solicitor is entitled to costs in respect of the work carried out.
These costs are generally paid from the ward's funds. These bills are measured
by the registrar for Wards of Court or are taxed by the Taxing Master.</p>

<p>The General Solicitor can only act as solicitor in those matters assigned to
them by the registrar of the Wards of Court. The General Solicitor cannot take
on private clients like a solicitor in private practice. In addition to acting
as solicitor in respect of the legal affairs of individual wards, the General
Solicitor also undertakes the following legal work:</p>
<ul><li>The issue of wardship proceedings in respect of an individual. If that
    individual ward is brought into wardship the General Solicitor may or may
    not be appointed committee</li>
  <li>Where a solicitor brings a wardship bill before the Taxing Master to have
    costs measured, the General Solicitor may be requested by the registrar of
    the Wards of Court to act as opponent before the Taxing Master in respect
    of the costs claimed.</li>
  <li>In certain instances where the General Solicitor is not committee of an
    individual ward, she may be directed by the President of the High Court to
    represent a particular interest in proceedings before the court which
    involve a ward or have a bearing on wardship matters.</li>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Garda Síochána (the national police force) hold a large volume of
records in relation to individual members of society. These records are
gathered and stored as part of the main function of the Gardaí; that is, to
investigate and detect crime, to protect life and property and to prevent
crime.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dataprotection.ie/ViewDoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2Flegal%2FLawOnDP%2Ehtm&amp;CatID=7&amp;m=l">Data
Protection Acts 1998 to 2003</a> confer rights on you to access certain
information (on computer, in manual or paper files) about you which is held by
the Gardaí. An example of this information would be any entry by the Gardaí
on the Garda PULSE system (the Garda computer system), or in Garda
investigation files. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Can I access any data being held on me by the Gardaí?</h3>

<p>Yes, but there are a number of restrictions on the data you may access. </p>

<p>Section 4 of the Data Protection Act allows you to make a request to the
Gardaí for a copy of any of your personal data being kept by them. On making
an access request to the Gardaí, you are entitled to:</p>
<ul><li>A copy of the data being kept about you </li>
  <li>A copy of any data held about you which is an opinion (except where such
    opinions were given in confidence) </li>
  <li>Know the purpose for which the data is being kept </li>
  <li>Know the identity of anyone to whom the Gardaí disclose that data </li>
  <li>Know the source of the data (i.e. where the data came from) unless it is
    contrary to public interest. </li>
</ul><p>You have a number of other rights under the Data Protection Acts, in
addition to the right of access described above These additional rights include
the right to have any inaccurate personal information about you corrected or
erased and the right to complain to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/data_protection.html">Data
Protection Commissioner</a>. </p>

<p>Once the Gardaí receive a correct request from you, they must reply to you
within 40 days. This is the case even if they do not hold any of your personal
data or they are refusing the request. </p>

<p>If the Gardaí decide that the information is to be provided to you, they
must: </p>
<ul><li>Supply the information to you within 40 days of receiving your request
  </li>
  <li>Provide the information in a manner or form which will be clear to you.
  </li>
</ul><p>If you request a copy of your criminal record, the record will be provided
in 2 parts, with <a href="../criminal_law/spent_convictions.html">spent
convictions</a> provided separately from the other convictions (if any).</p>

<h3>Why can the Gardaí refuse my request? </h3>

<p>Under the Data Protection Acts, the Gardaí can refuse any request for
personal data and can withhold that information on the following grounds:</p>
<ul><li>If the access application or request for data would identify someone
    else. This also applies in relation to the obligation on the Gardaí to
    provide details of the source of the information held. If the source or
    origin of the information identifies a third party, then it can be
    withheld. </li>
  <li>If the personal data being kept is for the purpose of preventing,
    detecting or investigating crime, or for arresting or prosecuting
    offenders. </li>
</ul><h3>Can somebody apply to the Gardaí for my personal data on my behalf?</h3>

<p>Yes. The Gardaí may receive an access request by a representative on your
behalf. They will however will need to satisfy themselves as to the identity of
that person and will have to be provided with enough information about you to
assist in establishing identity and locating the data sought or requested. </p>

<p>The Gardaí will require written confirmation from you, authorising your
representative to make the request. An example of this could be where your
solicitor would be authorised by you to request the information.</p>

<p>Where the request is in relation to a child, then a parent or guardian can
exercise the right to apply for and receive the information on behalf of the
child if:</p>
<ul><li>The child does not have the intellectual ability to understand the nature
    of the request </li>
  <li>The parent or guardian is acting in the best interest of the child. </li>
</ul><h3>Can the Gardaí access personal data held on me by other people?</h3>

<p>Yes. In certain circumstances, the Gardaí are entitled to access your
personal data. In such circumstances the person holding such personal data on
you will not be in breach of the rules against disclosing personal data to
third parties. The following are the occasions where the Gardaí are allowed to
access such personal data:</p>
<ul><li>If in the opinion of a member of the Gardaí (not below the rank of Chief
    Superintendent), the personal data is required for the purpose of
    safeguarding the security of the State </li>
  <li>If the personal data is required for the purpose of preventing, detecting
    or investigating crime or for arresting or prosecuting offenders </li>
</ul></div>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<h3>How do I apply to the Gardaí for my personal data?</h3>

<p>Requests for personal data must be made in writing to the Garda Criminal
Records Office. While it is not a requirement to mention the Data Information
Acts, it is recommended that you do. You can <a href="http://www.garda.ie/Documents/User/F20%20Data%20Protection%20Access%20Request%20Form%201%20November%202016.pdf">download
the Gardaí's access request form (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>You must provide enough information to establish your identity and to allow
the Vetting Unit to locate the information you request. It is important (from
the Gardaí’s point of view) that they establish your identity to ensure the
information is given to the right person. </p>

<p>In order to obtain your own personal data, you are required to provide the
following: </p>
<ul><li>Your full name</li>
  <li>Your correct date of birth </li>
  <li>Any other names used by you </li>
  <li>Your current address and previous addresses in Ireland </li>
  <li>A copy of your passport, driving licence or birth certificate </li>
  <li>A fee of €6.35. </li>
</ul><h3>What can I do if the Gardaí refuse my request?</h3>

<p>If you are of the opinion that the Gardaí are in breach of the law by not
giving you the personal data you requested, you can make a complaint to the
Data Protection Commissioner. The Commissioner will investigate your complaint
unless they are of the opinion that the complaint is frivolous or vexatious.
(That is, your complaint is without any foundation). As soon as the Data
Protection Commissioner has investigated your complaint, you will be notified
in writing of the decision.</p>

<p>If the Data Protection Commissioner is of the opinion that the Gardaí are
in breach of the Act, the Commissioner may serve what is called an
<em>enforcement notice</em> on the Garda Commissioner and make the Gardaí hand
over to you the information you requested. </p>

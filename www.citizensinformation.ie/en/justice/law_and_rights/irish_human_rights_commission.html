<p>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is an independent body set up
under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0025/index.html">Irish
Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014</a> on 1 November 2014. Under the
Act, the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission were

    prohibited conduct</li>
</ul><p>The Commission carries out these functions by:</p>

  <li>Keeping under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice
    in the State relating to human rights and equality</li>

</ul></div>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lf6c59">Human rights issues</h2>

<p>The Commission can assist you to further <a href="http://www.ihrec.ie/your-rights/what-are-human-rights.html">human rights
issues</a> by assisting you with legal proceedings. If you want the Commission
to grant assistance in relation to legal proceedings involving issues of human
rights you must first be clear what the human right issue is. When you make
your request to the Commission:</p>
<ul><li>Be clear how the legal proceeding is linked to the function of the
    Commission</li>
  <li>Identify how the legal proceeding could change how human rights are
    protected in Ireland</li>
  <li>You must have made reasonable efforts to get legal assistance elsewhere,
    for example, <a href="../legal_aid_and_advice/civil_legal_advice_and_legal_aid.html">civil
    legal aid</a> or <a href="../legal_aid_and_advice/criminal_legal_aid.html">criminal legal
    aid</a></li>
</ul><p>The Commission is not an adjudicator body in respect of complaints of human
rights violations in Ireland. It cannot offer remedies or compensation in cases
where human rights have been violated. It cannot overturn court, or tribunal
decisions, or require government departments to give entitlements to people who
may feel they have an entitlement. </p>

<p>Contact the Commission for more information about how requests for legal
assistance are assessed.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l5e352">Equality and discrimination</h2>

<p>There are 2 distinct pieces of legislation in place which set out equality
rights for people and specifically outlaw discrimination when it occurs. The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0021/index.html">Employment
Equality Acts 1998–2015</a> and the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0008/index.html">Equal
Status Acts 2000–2015</a> outlaw discrimination in employment, vocational
training, advertising, collective agreements, the provision of goods and
services. Specifically, goods and services include professional or trade
services; health services; access to accommodation and education; facilities
for banking, transport and cultural activities.</p>

<p>Under equality legislation discrimination based on any one of the following
distinct grounds is unlawful. These grounds are:</p>
<ul><li>Gender</li>
  <li>Civil status</li>
  <li>Family status</li>
  <li>Sexual orientation</li>
  <li>Religion</li>
  <li>Age (does not apply to a person under 16)</li>
  <li>Disability</li>
  <li>Race</li>
  <li>Membership of the Traveller community</li>
</ul><p>Since 1 January 2016, under the Equal Status Acts 2000–2015, you cannot be
discriminated against when renting because you are getting Rent Supplement or
any other social welfare payment, or a Housing Assistance Payment. This is
known as the housing assistance ground. </p>

<h3>What is discrimination?</h3>

<p>Discrimination is defined as less favourable treatment. A person is said to
be discriminated against if they are treated less favourably than another is,
has been or would be treated in a comparable situation on any of the grounds
mentioned above. To establish direct discrimination, a direct comparison must
be made, for example, in the case of disability discrimination the comparison
must be between a person who has a disability and another who has not, or
between persons with different disabilities.</p>

<p>Indirect discrimination occurs when practices or policies that do not appear
to discriminate against one group more than another actually have a
discriminatory impact. It can also happen where a requirement that may appear
non-discriminatory.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>Complaints under the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015 must be brought
within 6 months of the last act of discrimination. You can make a complaint to
the <a href="../../employment/enforcement_and_redress/labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace
Relations Commission</a> using the online complaint form on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.</p>

<p>To make a complaint under the Equal Status Acts 2000-2015 you must first
notify the person or organisation you are making the complaint against within 2
months of the last act of discrimination. If you are not satisfied with the
service provider's response, or if they have made no response within 1 month
from the date you notified them, you can bring a complaint to the Workplace
Relations Commission within 6 months of the last act of discrimination.</p>

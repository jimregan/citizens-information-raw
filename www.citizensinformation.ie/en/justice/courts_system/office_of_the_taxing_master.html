<p>The Taxing Master provides an independent and impartial assessment of legal
costs incurred by an individual or company involved in litigation ("taxation of
costs"). This means, that they assess the fair and reasonable amount that one
party has to pay to the other side. There are currently 2 Taxing Masters in
Ireland, both of whom are based in Dublin. (See 'Where to apply').</p>

<p>Usually, costs are taxed at the end/conclusion of a case, but this doesn't
always happen. Sometimes, a Court may award costs in respect of certain
applications prior to the final conclusion of the case. The party that is
claiming the costs (usually, the successful plaintiff or defendant) must
demonstrate that the costs they are claiming were proper and reasonable, given
the circumstances. There are two main types of costs: </p>
<ul><li>Party and Party Costs </li>
  <li>Solicitor and Client Costs </li>
</ul><p><strong><span>Party and Party Costs:</span></strong> These are essentially
all the costs, charges and expenses that are reasonably incurred by one of the
parties in the action, for the purposes of the case. It's important to remember
that all the costs may not be allowable and if you are claiming these costs,
you must be able to justify why they were incurred and why those costs should
be allowed. The courts have held in the past that you are bound when conducting
your case to remember that your adversary may in the end have to pay your costs
(or you may have to pay theirs) so it pays to be mindful of costs at all times.
</p>

<p><span><strong>Solicitor and Client Costs:</strong> </span>These are the
costs you are obliged to pay your solicitor or legal representative that are
not recoverable under Party and Party Costs. </p>

<h3>Charges to clients</h3>

<p>The Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994 (Section 68) provides for solicitors to
charge their clients. Under this legislation, your solicitor should give you a
detailed statement of all the legal costs associated with your case. The
statement of costs you receive, must contain certain things: </p>
<ul><li>Summary of the legal services you were provided with </li>
  <li>Details of all the charges that were incurred the the nature of these
    charges </li>
  <li>Total amount (value) of damages you received, or other money that was
    recovered </li>
</ul><p>This detailed statement of charges and costs is known as a <span>Bill of
Costs</span>.</p>

<h3>Taxation of costs</h3>

<p>The 'taxation of costs' is a misleading term, in that it has nothing to do
with taxation in the normal sense or with the Revenue Commissioners. Taxation
of costs from an action/case arise in a number of different situations (for
example, when ordered by the court, when demanded by a client, when ordered by
a tribunal, as a result of an arbitration hearing, etc.). </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The Taxing Master <span>does not</span> have any regulatory or investigative
powers in relation to complaints about excessive charges by solicitors in
Ireland for legal services. Complaints about excessive charges should be
referred to the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.lawsociety.ie/">Law Society of
Ireland</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you wish to have your costs subject to taxation, you should instruct your
solicitor to forward a special form (called a '<span>Requisition to Tax</span>'
form) to you , so that the Bill of Costs can be subject to taxation. When you
receive this form, you sign and return it to your solicitor who will then set
the matter down for taxation. You will then be notified by your solicitor of
the date of the taxation and you should attend the hearing. It's important to
remember that you have the option of retaining a legal representative for the
taxation hearing. </p>

<p>If your solicitor refuses to set the matter down for taxation, you can set
the matter down yourself by completing and lodging the <span>Requisition to
Tax</span> form, lodging a <span>Summons to Tax/Notice to Tax</span> (in
triplicate form) and lodging the <span>Bill of Costs</span> with the Office of
the Taxing Master. (You can purchase the Requisition of Taxes form and the
Summons form in any legal stationers). </p>

<p>The Office of the Taxing Master will then inform you when you should be in
attendance for the hearing.</p>

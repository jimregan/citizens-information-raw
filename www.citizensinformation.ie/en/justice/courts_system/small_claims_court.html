<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>The aim of the Small Claims Court procedure is to provide an inexpensive,
fast and easy way for consumers to resolve disputes without the need to employ
a solicitor. Both the claimant and the respondent must be living or based
within the State. If either party lives or is based in another EU member state,
the <a href="european_small_claims_procedure.html">European Small Claims
Procedure</a> should be used.</p>

<p>The Small Claims service is provided in the local District Court offices.
</p>

<p>The procedure can be used to resolve consumer complaints. Certain other
types of disputes are also eligible. Since January 2010, businesses can make
claims against other businesses. </p>

<p>The claim cannot exceed €2,000.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The following types of consumer claims can be dealt with under the Small
Claims procedure:</p>
<ul><li>Consumer claims such as for faulty goods or bad workmanship. You must
    have bought the goods or service for private use from someone selling them
    in the course of business. </li>
  <li>Claims can also be made for minor damage to your property. </li>
  <li>Claims for the non-return of a rent deposit for certain kinds of rented
    properties, such as, a holiday home or a flat in a premises where the
    landlord also lives. The <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/renting_a_home/private_residential_tenancies_board.html">Private
    Residential Tenancies Board</a> handles such claims for the mainstream
    private rented housing sector. </li>
</ul><p>Consumer claims cannot be made in the Small Claims Court for debts, personal
injuries or breach of leasing or hire-purchase agreements. </p>

<p>Businesses can make claims against other businesses in relation to contracts
for goods or services purchased. It does not apply to claims in relation to:</p>
<ul><li>Agreements to which the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Consumer
    Credit Act 1995</a> applies </li>
  <li>Breaches of leasing agreements </li>
  <li>Debt or liquidated damages </li>
</ul><p>The procedure is designed to deal with claims up to €2,000. </p>

<p>The procedure can be summarised as follows:</p>
<ul><li>The claimant completes the application form and sends it to the <a shape="rect" href="../courtroom/court_registrar.html">Registrar</a> with
    the relevant fee. </li>
  <li>The application is registered by the Registrar </li>
  <li>A copy of the claim and a Notice of Claim is sent by the Registrar to the
    respondent </li>
</ul><p>At this stage, there are various choices available to the respondent: </p>
<ul><li>They can admit the claim </li>
  <li>They can dispute the claim </li>
  <li>They can counterclaim </li>
  <li>They might ignore the claim. </li>
</ul><h3>Respondent admits the claim</h3>

<p>The respondent has 15 calendar days to reply. Where the respondent admits
the claim, he/she completes a Notice of Acceptance of Liability, and returns it
to the Registrar</p>

<p>The respondent has 3 options:</p>
<ol><li>The respondent agrees to pay the amount claimed. Here, the respondent
    agrees to pay you immediately. Payment is made by cheque, postal order or
    money order, made payable to the claimant, and sent to the Registrar. If
    payment is conditional, e.g., the goods must be returned, then the
    Registrar must seek the claimant's agreement </li>
  <li>The respondent consents to judgement. Here, the respondent will only pay
    you when judgement is made in the Small Claims Court Office. You will not
    have to attend at court. The claimant swears an Affidavit of Debt and makes
    a request for Judgement and Decree. The Registrar will assist the claimant
    in this procedure. The Registrar will notify the respondent of the
    judgement. The respondent has 28 calendar days to comply with the
    judgement. </li>
  <li>The respondent wishes to pay the amount claimed in instalments. The
    Registrar must inform the claimant of this request and must seek the
    consent of the claimant to the terms proposed. </li>
</ol><h3>Respondent disputes the claim</h3>

<p>The respondent has 15 calendar days to reply and returns to the Registrar
the Notice of Dispute within the 15 calendar day period. The Registrar sends
the claimant a copy of the Notice of Dispute and tries to settle the dispute.
If no settlement can be reached, the matter is then set down for court
hearing.</p>

<h3>The respondent counterclaims</h3>

<p>The respondent outlines his/her intention to counterclaim on the Notice of
Dispute and sends the appropriate fee to the Registrar. The Registrar sends the
claimant a copy of the Notice of Dispute and Counterclaim.</p>

<h3>The respondent does not reply to the claim</h3>

<p>The respondent has 15 calendar days to reply to the claim. Where there is no
reply by the respondent, he/she is then held to have admitted the claim. The
procedure is the same as if he/she had consented to judgement. The claimant
swears an Affidavit of Debt and makes a request for Judgement and Decree. The
Registrar will assist the claimant in this procedure. The Registrar will notify
the respondent of the Judgement. The Respondent has 28 calendar days to comply
with the judgement.</p>

<h3>Court Appearance</h3>

<p>If your case has been referred to court for hearing it may be advisable to
get legal advice. Under Irish Law should there be court proceedings a business
has to be legally represented.</p>

<p>You will receive a letter from the Small Claims Office telling you the date
and time of the court hearing and the location of the court itself. </p>

<p>If you have any difficulty with attending court on that date, notify the
Small Claims Office and the respondent immediately. You may ask to have the
date adjourned, or put back, to another date. Only the judge can make this
order and you will need a very good reason for not being able to attend or go
ahead with the case on that date. If you cannot attend yourself, you can send a
representative to make the request to the court on your behalf. </p>

<p>At your hearing, when all the witnesses have been heard, the judge will
usually make his or her decision there and then. If the judge decides in your
favour, he or she will make an order or Decree. This is usually an order for
the respondent to pay an amount of money to you, but the judge can decide to
make any order he or she sees fit. For example, the Judge may direct that the
work be completed or the goods be repaired. The order will be made to suit your
particular case.</p>

<p>If the court makes a Decree for an amount of money, the respondent has 28
calendar days to pay you. If the court makes any other type of Decree, it will
usually put a time limit within which it must be completed.</p>

<p>If the judge decides not to uphold your claim, your case will be dismissed,
this means that no order or Decree will be made in your favour.</p>

<p>See "Further information" below for more on preparing for court and the
court hearing.</p>

<h3>Enforcing your judgement</h3>

<p>Once you have obtained judgement and have a decree, there is the possibility
that the respondent will not comply with the order of the court. In this
situation, you may need to enforce your judgement. The most usual way of
enforcing a judgement is to give the Decree to the Sheriff/County Registrar for
execution. </p>

<p>You will have to apply to the Small Claims Registrar to have the Decree sent
to you. The Registrar will not automatically send you the Decree for execution
in this way. After you give the Decree to the Sheriff/County Registrar, they
then go to the respondent and seizes goods or money to the value of the amount
set out in your Decree. </p>

<p>It will involve a fee, payable to the Sheriff/County Registrar. If the
Sheriff/County Registrar successfully executes the judgement, this fee will be
refunded to you.</p>

<p>Information and assistance on enforcement procedures is available from the
Small Claims Registrar.</p>

<h3>Appealing a decision</h3>

<p>If you are not satisfied with the decision of the Small Claims Court, you
can appeal your case to the Circuit Court. Careful consideration should be
given to this decision. You should look at why your case failed and consider
how likely you are to succeed in another court. If you are not successful in
your appeal, there is a possibility you might be held liable for the other
parties' costs. In addition, if you decide to appeal to the Circuit Court, you
may need to get advice or assistance from a lawyer since this is a higher and
more formal court. You must make your application for appeal within 14 calendar
days of the court hearing.</p>

<p>The respondent also has a right to appeal the decision to the Circuit Court.
They too must do this within 14 calendar days of the court hearing. If this
happens, you will receive notice from the court office.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The current fee for making a claim in the Small Claims Court is €25. This
fee is payable by cheque or postal order. The District Court Clerk or the Small
Claims Registrar will accept the fee in cash if you pay it in person. If your
claim is accepted as suitable for the Small Claims Court the fee is not
refunded, even if your claim is successful. <br></p>

<h2>Completing the application form</h2>

<p>Before you begin to fill in the application form, the following information
will be useful to help explain the various parts of the form. There are three
distinct sections to the form.</p>

<h3>Claimant </h3>

<p>The person taking the claim is the claimant. This section is for your
personal details. Here you should enter your name and address. It is important
to make sure that the correct person is making the claim. The person who bought
the faulty goods or the person who ordered the work to be carried out should be
the one to take the claim. Likewise, the person whose property has been damaged
should be the one making the claim. </p>

<h3>Respondent </h3>

<p>This section is for the details of the person or company you are making the
claim against. You must make the claim against a person or a company. Often you
may not know who owns the shop you bought the faulty goods from. It is not
enough to just put the name of the shop on the application form. You must
investigate who owns the shop. </p>

<p>You can do this by making a Companies Search in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.cro.ie/">Companies Registration Office</a>. Here you will find
a register of all the companies in the country. If the shop is not registered
as a company, try a Business Name Search, also in the Companies Registration
Office. If the respondent resides outside of Ireland, you should ask them to
nominate, in writing, someone in this country (usually their agent or
solicitor) to accept proceedings on their behalf. </p>

<h3>Claim </h3>

<p>In this section, you should set out the facts of your case clearly and
simply. </p>
<ul><li>When did you buy the goods/services? When was your property damaged? When
    did you rent the property? </li>
  <li>Who is your claim against? </li>
  <li>What went wrong? </li>
  <li>How did you deal with it? </li>
  <li>Why are you taking court action? </li>
  <li>How much are you claiming for? </li>
</ul><p>It is important to include the amount for which you are claiming. If the
claim is not disputed, you may get judgement without having to go to court.
Bear in mind that you can normally only claim the amount for which you are
directly out of pocket, in other words, the amount you paid for the faulty
goods and/or any cost involved in having them repaired. It is therefore a good
idea to keep all receipts and documentation to show what these amounts are. </p>

<p>Sometimes the Small Claims Court may allow you to claim some general damage
where there was distress caused to you by a faulty product or service. A good
example of this is where a holiday goes disastrously wrong. You can <a shape="rect" href="/en/consumer_affairs/travel/package_holidays.html">read more

<h2>Court Appearance </h2>

<h3>Preparing for court</h3>

<p>It is very important to prepare yourself for the court hearing and it may be
advisable to get legal advice. Under Irish Law should there be court
proceedings a business has to be legally represented.</p>

<p>You will need to present information to the judge that sets out clearly the
nature of your relationship with the respondent. This relationship could relate
to the roles of:</p>
<ul><li>Consumer/Retailer </li>
  <li>Consumer/Service Provider </li>
  <li>Owner of property the respondent has allegedly damaged </li>
  <li>Tenant/Landlord </li>
</ul><p>You will need to show what went wrong and give the circumstances surrounding
the problem.</p>

<p>You will need to show how you tried to put the matter right and the steps
you took to remedy the situation. </p>

<p>You should also know how the various consumer laws protect you in your
particular situation and draw the court's attention to them. You can <a shape="rect" href="/en/consumer_affairs/consumer_protection/consumer_rights/">read
more about consumer rights here</a>.</p>

<p>You should be clear about exactly what it is you are claiming for. </p>

<h3>Gathering evidence </h3>

<p>When presenting your information to the court, you should back it up with
evidence wherever possible. You should: </p>
<ul><li>have your receipt or other proof of purchase ready </li>
  <li>bring the faulty or damaged goods to the court to show them to the judge
  </li>
  <li>take photographs of poor workmanship, damaged property or poor quality
    goods or services that you can't bring to court </li>
  <li>get an independent opinion by another expert and have the expert appear
    in the court as your witness (you will be responsible for any expense this
    might incur) </li>
  <li>bring any letters, advertisements or any other documents you may have
    relied on when buying the goods or services </li>
  <li>ask any other person who can back up your claim, especially in the case
    of faulty services provided, to attend as a witness. You can send them a
    witness summons if necessary – the Small Claims Registrar can issue a
    witness summons on your behalf for a small fee. </li>
</ul><h3>The Court Hearing </h3>

<p>On the day of your court hearing, you will have to attend the District
Court. It will be a court open to the public and it will be a District Court
Judge that will hear your case. </p>

<p>When your case is called you will hear your name called out and then the
name of the respondent, e.g., "Patrick Murphy versus Joe Ryan". </p>

<p>At this point, you should stand up and identify yourself to the court. The
Small Claims Registrar will then call out to the judge a summary of what your
case is about. You will then be asked to go to the witness box. You will stand
in the witness box and the Court Clerk will assist you to swear an oath or to
make an affirmation to tell the truth. The judge will then ask you to begin
your case. Here is where you must give your side of the dispute, in as clear a
fashion as possible and backed up with as much evidence as you need. </p>

<p>The judge will ask you some questions, which you should answer as best you
can. Remember, the correct way to address the judge is "judge" and you should
direct your answers to the judge at all times. When you have answered the
judge's questions, the judge will give the respondent an opportunity to
question you. Answer these questions as best you can but do not start an
argument with the respondent. After this, you will be allowed to leave the
witness box. If you wish to call a witness, you should do so at this time. Your
witness will go through a similar procedure. When your witness or witnesses
have finished, it will be the respondent's turn to give his or her evidence. If
your case is against a company, a representative of the company will speak on
its behalf. </p>

<p>The procedure for the respondent is very much the same as it was for you.
You will get an opportunity to question the respondent when the judge has
finished asking him/her questions. You can prepare for this by studying the
respondent's reply on the Notice of Dispute (and Counterclaim, if relevant) and
by preparing questions in advance. You will also need to listen carefully to
what the respondent says while in the witness box and you can challenge any
evidence you do not agree with at this time. The respondent will then have an
opportunity to call witnesses to give evidence. You will also be given an
opportunity to put questions to these witnesses. </p>

<p>When all the witnesses have been heard, the judge will usually make his or
her decision there and then. </p>

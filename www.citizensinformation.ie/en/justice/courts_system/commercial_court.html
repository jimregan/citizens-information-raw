<p>The Commercial Court is a division of the <a href="high_court.html">High
Court</a> and was established in 2004 to provide efficient and effective
dispute resolution in commercial cases. It is governed by <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/8652fb610b0b37a980256db700399507/71b5764f57d3440980256f340064227a?OpenDocument">Order
63A of the Rules of the Superior Courts</a> in particular.</p>

<p>The Commercial Court deals with the following type of business disputes:</p>
<ul><li>Disputes of a commercial nature between commercial bodies where the value
    of the claim is at least €1 million</li>
  <li>Proceedings under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0001/index.html">Arbitration
    Act 2010</a> with a value of at least €1 million</li>
  <li>Disputes concerning intellectual property</li>
  <li>Appeals from or applications for judicial review of regulatory
  decisions</li>
  <li>Proceedings in connection with any function of the Registrar under the
    Cape Town Convention or the Aircraft Protocol as defined in the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0015/index.html">International
    Interests in Mobile Equipment (Cape Town Convention) Act 2005</a></li>
  <li>Other cases a judge of the Commercial Court considers appropriate</li>
</ul><p>There is no automatic right of entry to the Commercial List of the High
Court. It is at the discretion of a judge of the Commercial Court.</p>

<p>The Court uses a detailed case management system that is designed to
streamline the preparation for trial, remove unnecessary costs and stalling
tactics, and ensure full pre-trial disclosure. The judge can adjourn
proceedings for up to 28 days to allow resolution of the dispute through some
form of alternative dispute resolution, such as mediation, conciliation or
arbitration.</p>

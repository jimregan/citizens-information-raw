<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Court of Appeal was established on 28 October 2014 under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0018/index.html">Court of
Appeal Act 2014</a>. Its main function is to hear appeals from the <a href="high_court.html">High Court</a> and the <a href="circuit_court.html">Circuit Court</a>. It took over the role of the <a href="court_of_criminal_appeal.html">Court of Criminal Appeal</a> and the
Courts-Martial Appeal Court which were abolished. The only appeals that go to
the <a href="supreme_court.html">Supreme Court</a> are those which raise
issues of major public importance or where the interests of justice require
such an appeal.</p>

<p>The Court of Appeal has a President and up to 9 judges. The Chief Justice
and the President of the High Court are additional judges. The President of the
Appeal Court is an additional judge of the Supreme Court and of the High
Court.</p>

<p>The President distributes and allocates the work of the Court of Appeal.
Matters coming before it are normally heard and determined by 3 judges.
However, some <em>interlocutory</em> and <em>procedural</em> applications may
be heard by the President or another nominated judge alone. An interlocutory
application is an application for a temporary decision to deal with issues that
will be finally decided when the case is fully heard. Procedural applications
could include, for example, an application for legal aid.</p>

<p>The Court of Appeal is not a court of local or limited jurisdiction.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l67122">Civil matters</h2>

<p>The Court of Appeal has jurisdiction in civil proceedings:</p>
<ul><li>It can hear appeals from decisions of the High Court except for those
    cases where the Supreme Court has permitted an appeal to it</li>
  <li>It may give a ruling on a question of law submitted to it by the Circuit
    Court</li>
  <li>It can hear appeals from cases heard in the High Court about whether or
    not a law is constitutional</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l39740">Criminal matters</h2>

<p>The Court of Appeal hears appeals against convictions or sentences given by
the Circuit Criminal Court, the Central Criminal Court (High Court) and the <a href="special_criminal_court.html">Special Criminal Court</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dppireland.ie/">Director of Public Prosecutions</a>
can appeal to the Court of Appeal:</p>
<ul><li>The leniency of a sentence</li>
  <li>A decision not to order a retrial</li>
</ul><p>The Director of Public Prosecutions can also appeal a point of law from a <a href="../criminal_law/criminal_trial/criminal_trial.html">trial on
indictment</a> to the Court of Appeal. This does not mean that the Court may
overturn the verdict of "not guilty". It simply clarifies the law for future
cases.</p>

<p>Although criminal cases are heard and determined by 3 judges, the Court of
Appeal gives one judgment unless there is a constitutional issue involved. The
existence of a dissenting opinion is not made public.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lcd659">Court-martial matters</h2>

<p>Courts-Martial are military courts. They deal with offences against military
law by members of the Defence Forces. The Court of Appeal hears appeals from
people who had been convicted by a Court-Martial.</p>

<p>Decisions of the Court of Appeal can only be appealed to the Supreme
Court:</p>

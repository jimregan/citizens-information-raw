<p>Special Criminal Courts relate to criminal trials only. They are established
where the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration
of justice and the preservation of public peace and order.</p>

<p>The present Special Criminal Court was established in 1972 and comprises
three judges of the ordinary courts - usually one High Court judge, one Circuit
Court Judge and District Court Judge. There is no jury in the Special Criminal
Court.</p>

<p>The Special Criminal Court has no civil jurisdiction. Criminal cases are
transferred from the ordinary criminal courts to the Special Criminal Court
if:</p>
<ul><li>The offence in question is a <em>scheduled offence</em>. Cases involving
    a scheduled offence generally involve <em>subversive crime</em> and are
    automatically transferred to the Special Criminal Court. The current list
    of scheduled offences includes:<br>
    -offences under Part 7 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0026/index.html">Criminal
    Justice Act 2006</a> (excluding conspiracy)<br>
    - offences under the Explosive Substances Act 1883<br>
    - offences under the Firearms Acts 1925 to 2006 <br>
    - offences under the Offences against the State Acts 1939 to 1998</li>
  <li>The offence in question is not a "scheduled offence" but the Director of
    Public Prosecutions issues a certificate stating that in his/her opinion,
    the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the administration of justice
    and the preservation of public peace and order. Once such a certificate is
    issued, the case must be transferred from the ordinary court to the Special
    Criminal Court. </li>
</ul><p>An appeal against conviction or sentence by a Special Criminal Court may be
taken to the <a shape="rect" href="court_of_appeal.html">Court of Appeal</a>

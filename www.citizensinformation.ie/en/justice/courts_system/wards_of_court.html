<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>When a person becomes unable to manage their assets because of mental
incapacity, an application can be made to the courts for them to become a Ward
of Court. The court must make a decision as to whether they are capable of
managing their own property for his or her own benefit and the benefit of his
or her dependants. If it is decided that the person cannot manage their own
property because of mental incapacity, a Committee is appointed to control the
assets on the Ward's behalf.</p>

<p>A person under 18 years old may be taken into Wardship as a minor for
reasons other than mental incapacity.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/64/enacted/en/html">Assisted
Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015</a> provides a statutory framework for
people who require assistance in making decisions about their welfare and their
property and affairs. The Act provides for people who have been brought into
Wardship to have their capacity assessed and brought under this new statutory
framework instead – these parts of the Act have not yet come into
operation.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Wardship as a minor</h3>

<p>When a person is under 18 years of age and is awarded damages, the money is
paid into the court and invested on the minor's behalf until they reach the age
of 18. People in this category are not Wards of Court. If, however, the minor
has special housing or care needs, they may be taken into Wardship as a minor.
</p>

<p>If a house is bought for the minor, it is registered in their name. When
they reach the age of 18 years, provided they are of full mental capacity, they
can apply to the High Court for payment of any funds held on their behalf. </p>

<h3>Mental incapacity</h3>

<p>To be made a Ward, the court must be satisfied that the person is of unsound
mind and incapable of managing their own affairs. In some cases, a person can
be taken into Wardship for their own protection. This would normally only arise
in the case of a person with a mental disability rather than a psychiatric
illness. </p>

<h3>How a person becomes a Ward of Court</h3>

<p>If you think there are grounds for someone being made a Ward of Court you
should contact a solicitor to take the necessary steps. Alternatively, if you
do not wish to be involved in the application yourself, you should write to the
Registrar of Wards of Court asking for the necessary steps to be taken.</p>

<p>In either case, information must be provided about their medical condition,
next-of-kin, assets and income.</p>

<p>If you are made a Ward of Court, the court may appoint a Committee to deal
with your personal affairs. The Committee means the person(s) into whose care
the ward is committed.</p>

<h3>How to object to becoming a Ward of Court</h3>

<p>Notice of the application must be served to the proposed Ward. </p>

<p>A proposed Ward is entitled to object to the application by writing to the
Registrar of Wards of Court, usually, though not necessarily, through a
solicitor. </p>

<h3>Providing for dependants</h3>

<p>A Ward who has dependants has a legal duty to maintain them and the <a shape="rect" href="office_of_wards_of_court.html">Office of Wards of Court</a>
will make arrangements to provide for their maintenance and benefit according
to their needs and the Ward's means.</p>

<h3>Relief and payment of income tax</h3>

<p>Wards have the same requirement to submit income tax returns as other
taxpayers but the return is signed by the Committee on behalf of the Ward, or
by the Ward's accountant, if they employed one before being brought into
Wardship. The principal tax reliefs are where exemption is granted by the Chief
Inspector of Taxes under Section 189 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and
medical expenses. </p>

<h3>The Ward's property</h3>

<p>After the President of the High Court has made an order bringing a person
into Wardship they appoint a committee to act on behalf of the Ward and give
directions to bring the Ward's assets under the control of the court and make
them available for the maintenance and benefit of the Ward.</p>

<p>Where it is necessary to sell the Ward’s home to provide for nursing home
expenses or to prevent it from being vandalised, the Committee will be
authorised by the court to put the property on the market.</p>

<p>Banks and building society accounts are usually closed and the proceeds
lodged in court.</p>

<h3>Buying a house</h3>

<p>Property cannot be bought on behalf of a Ward as an investment because this
does not at present constitute an Authorised Trustee Security. </p>

<p>A property may be bought on behalf of the Ward if they are able to reside in
the community and have sufficient means and if the Ward does not have adequate
or suitable accommodation. </p>

<p>If the Ward is in residential care and their dependants need to be housed,
property can be bought in the name of the Ward for their benefit. </p>

<h3>Medical care for Wards</h3>

<p>In former years, most Wards were patients in hospital or nursing homes.
Today, many live in the community or in sheltered accommodation. If a Ward
needs medical treatment for which a consent form is required by the hospital,
the approval of the President of the High Court should be obtained. In
emergency cases, it may not be possible to gain approval. In this case, normal
medical considerations should apply. </p>

<h3>Marriage</h3>

<p>A person who is a Ward because of mental incapacity cannot marry, although
being taken into Wardship after marriage does not invalidate the marriage. </p>

<h3>Leaving the jurisdiction</h3>

<p>A Ward of Court may not leave Ireland without the consent of the President
of the High Court. In practice, permission to leave the jurisdiction is
normally granted, taking into account medical or safety considerations. </p>

<h3>Resuming own affairs</h3>

<p>An application by a Ward to be discharged from Wardship must be made to the
Registrar of Wards of Court in writing by the Ward or by a solicitor on their
behalf. The application should be based on medical evidence to the effect that
the Ward is now sound of mind and capable of managing their own affairs. </p>

<h3>Making a will</h3>

<p>A Ward may make a will if:</p>
<ul><li>They express the wish to make a will </li>
  <li>There is medical evidence that they are capable of making a valid will
  </li>
  <li>The solicitor instructed by the Ward is satisfied that they are capable
    of making a valid will </li>
</ul><h3>When a Ward dies</h3>

<p>When a Ward dies, after any debts have been paid and when a <a shape="rect" href="/en/death/the_deceaseds_estate/dealing_with_the_deceaseds_estate.html">Grant
of Probate or Administration</a> has issued, the estate is distributed
according to the Ward's will or under the rules of intestate succession. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Legal fees from a Wardship application are normally paid out of the Ward's
estate. These costs include solicitor's fees, medical report fees and stamp
duty. Court percentages (annual levy on Ward's income) are also payable. At
present, the maximum rate of court percentages is €750 per annum. This
maximum rate only applies if the Ward's net income in the proceeding tax year
was €18,750 or more. </p>

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>When a person becomes unable to manage his or her assets because of mental
incapacity, an application can be made to the courts for this person to become
a Ward of Court. The court must make a decision as to whether the person is
capable of managing his or her own property for his or her own benefit and the
benefit of his or her dependants. If it is decided that the person cannot
manage his or her own property because of mental incapacity, a Committee is
appointed to control the assets on the Ward's behalf.</p>

<p>A person under 18 years old may also be taken into Wardship as a Minor. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Wardship as a Minor</h3>

<p>When a person is under 18 years of age and is awarded damages, the money is
paid into the court and invested on the Minor's behalf until he/she reaches the
age of 18 years. People in this category are not Wards of Court. If, however,
the Minor has special housing or care needs, he or she is taken into Wardship
as a Minor. </p>

<p>If a house is bought for the Minor, it is registered in the Minor's name.
When the Minor reaches the age of 18 years, provided he/she is of full mental
capacity, he/she can apply to the High Court for payment of any funds held on
his/her behalf. </p>

<h3>Mental incapacity</h3>

<p>To be made a Ward, the court must be satisfied that the person is of unsound
mind and incapable of managing his or her own affairs. In some cases, a person
can be taken into Wardship for his or her own protection. This would normally
only arise in the case of a person with a mental disability rather than a
psychiatric illness. </p>

<h3>How a person becomes a Ward of Court</h3>

<p>The usual application procedure involves a person (called the petitioner)
asking the High Court to hold an inquiry into whether the proposed ward (called
the respondent) is of unsound mind and capable of managing his or her person or
property. An application is also called a petition, this is a formal written
submission to the court. Applications are normally made by a family member. </p>

<p>The person making the application should contact a solicitor because he or
she must swear an affidavit which is witnessed by a solicitor. The application
must include the opinion of two doctors, they do not have to be psychiatrists
but they usually are. </p>

<p>If a person does not want to be involved in the application, he or she can
also contact the Registrar of Wards of Court to initiate proceedings. </p>

<p>In either case, the following information, in relation to the proposed Ward,
must be provided:</p>
<ul><li>Information about his or her medical condition </li>
  <li>Information about his or her next-of-kin </li>
  <li>Information about his or her assets </li>
  <li>Information about his or her income. </li>
</ul><p>The President of the High Court then decides whether or not to conduct an
inquiry. If an inquiry is ordered, the proposed ward is examined by a doctor
sent by the High Court. </p>

<p>If you are made a ward of court, the court may appoint a Committee to deal
with your personal affairs. The Committee means the person into whose care the
ward is committed. The person who makes the application is usually (but not
always) the person authorised to act as the Committee. If you live in a nursing
home, the person who is in charge of that nursing home is excluded from being
the Committee.</p>

<h3>How to object to becoming a ward of court</h3>

<p>The petition or application to make you a ward of court must be served on
you. You can object to the inquiry to make you a ward of court or demand that
it be held before a jury. If you want to object, you must sign the objection
notice and have this witnessed by a solicitor. If you object, there must be a
hearing. The hearing is before the President of the High Court and there may be
a jury if the judge so decides. You do not have a right to a jury. </p>

<h3>Rights and entitlements of Wards of Court</h3>

<p>Notice of the application must be served to the proposed Ward. </p>

<p>A proposed Ward is entitled to object to the application by writing to the
Registrar of Wards of Court, usually, though not necessarily, through a
solicitor. </p>

<h3>Providing for dependants</h3>

<p>A Ward who has dependants has a legal duty to maintain them and the <a shape="rect" href="office_of_wards_of_court.html">Office of Wards of Court</a>
will make arrangements to provide for their maintenance and benefit according
to their needs and the Ward's means.</p>

<h3>Relief and payment of income tax</h3>

<p>Wards have the same liability to submit income tax returns as other
taxpayers but the return is signed by the Committee on behalf of the Ward, or
by the Ward's accountant, if the accountant was employed prior to the Ward
being brought into Wardship. The principal tax reliefs are where exemption is
granted by the Chief Inspector of Taxes under Section 189 of the Taxes
Consolidation Act 1997 and medical expenses. </p>

<h3>The Ward's property</h3>

<p>The appointed Committee acts on behalf of the Ward and gives directions to
bring the Ward's assets under the control of the court and make them available
for his or her maintenance and benefit. </p>

<p>Examples of how different types of property might be dealt with are as
follows:</p>
<ul><li>Residence: Where it is necessary to sell a house to provide for nursing
    home expenses or to prevent it from being vandalised, the Committee will be
    authorised by the court to put the property on the market. </li>
  <li>Banks and building society accounts: These accounts are usually closed
    and the proceeds lodged in court. </li>
</ul><h3>Buying a house</h3>

<p>Property cannot be bought on behalf of a Ward as an investment because this
does not at present constitute an Authorised Trustee Security. </p>

<p>A property may be bought on behalf of the Ward if the Ward is able to reside
in the community and has sufficient means and if the Ward does not have
adequate or suitable accommodation. </p>

<p>If the Ward is in residential care and his or her dependants need to be
housed, property can be bought in the name of the Ward for their benefit. </p>

<h3>Medical care for Wards</h3>

<p>In former years, most Wards were patients in hospital or nursing homes.
Today, many live in the community or in sheltered accommodation. If a Ward
needs medical treatment for which a consent form is required by the hospital,
the approval of the President of the High Court should be obtained. In
emergency cases, it may not be possible to gain approval. In this case, normal
medical considerations should apply. </p>

<h3>Marriage</h3>

<p>A person who is a Ward because of mental incapacity cannot marry, although
being taken into Wardship after marriage does not invalidate the marriage. </p>

<h3>Leaving the jurisdiction</h3>

<p>A Ward of Court may not leave Ireland without the consent of the President
of the High Court. In practice, permission to leave the jurisdiction is
normally granted, taking into account medical or safety considerations. </p>

<h3>Resuming own affairs</h3>

<p>An application by a Ward to be discharged from Wardship must be made to the
Registrar of Wards of Court in writing by the Ward or by a solicitor on his or
her behalf. The application should be based on medical evidence to the effect
that the Ward is now sound of mind and capable of managing his or her own
affairs. </p>

<h3>Making a will</h3>

<p>A Ward may make a will if:</p>
<ul><li>He or she expresses the wish to make a will </li>
  <li>There is medical evidence to the effect that he or she has is capable of
    making a valid will </li>
  <li>The solicitor instructed by the Ward is satisfied that he or she is
    capable of making a valid will. </li>
</ul><h3>When a Ward dies</h3>

<p>When a Ward dies, after any debts have been paid and when a <a shape="rect" href="/en/death/the_deceaseds_estate/dealing_with_the_deceaseds_estate.html">Grant
of Probate or Administration</a> has issued, the estate is distributed
according to the Ward's will or under the rules of intestate succession. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Legal fees from a Wardship application are normally paid out of the Ward's
estate. These costs include solicitor's fees, medical report fees and stamp
duty. Court percentages (annual levy on Ward's income) are also payable. At
present, the maximum rate of court percentages is 750 euro per annum. This
maximum rate only applies if the Ward's net income in the proceeding tax year
was 18,750 euro or more. </p>

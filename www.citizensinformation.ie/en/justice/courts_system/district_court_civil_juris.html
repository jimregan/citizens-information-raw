<p>The District Court is the lowest court in the Irish court system. It is
presided over by the President of the District Court and 63 District Court
Judges. </p>

<p>The District Court is organised on a regional basis. There are 23 District
Court Districts, as well as the Dublin Metropolitan District. Each District is
in turn divided into District Court areas.</p>

<p>The District Court is a court of local and limited jurisdiction. This means
it is restricted as to which cases it can decide in both civil and criminal
matters.</p>

<p>Under Part 3 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/act/pub/0032/index.html">Courts
and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013</a> the monetary jurisdiction
of the District Court increased to €15,000 (was €6,348.69) with effect from
3 February 2014.</p>

District Court area:</p>
<ul><li>Where the defendant or one of the defendants ordinarily resides or
    carries on any profession, business or occupation</li>

    the tort is alleged to have been committed </p>
    <p>- in proceedings to eject a person from lands or property, where the
    lands or property in question is located</p>
  </li>
</ul><h3>Limited jurisdiction</h3>

<h3>Local jurisdiction</h3>

<p>A criminal case will be heard in the District Court area where:</p>
<ul><li>The offence was committed or</li>
  <li>The defendant resides or carries on business or</li>
  <li>The defendant was arrested</li>
</ul><h3>Limited jurisdiction</h3>

<p>There are two types of criminal offences:</p>
<ul><li>Summary offences, i.e., offences that are tried by a judge sitting
  alone</li>
  <li>Indictable offences, i.e., offences that can be tried by a judge and
  jury</li>
</ul><p>The criminal jurisdiction of the District Court falls under the following
headings.</p>

<p><strong>Summary offences</strong> that may be heard by the District Court
Judge sitting without a jury. This makes up the great bulk of the work of the
District Court and these offences come from legislation only.</p>

<p><strong>Indictable offences which are triable summarily</strong> on the
basis that:</p>
<ul><li>In the view of the judge, the facts alleged constitute a minor offence
  and</li>
  <li>The accused, on being informed of his/her right to be tried by a jury,
    does not object to being tried summarily and </li>
  <li>In the case of certain offences, the Director of Public Prosecutions has
    consented to a summary trial</li>
</ul><p>These types of offences are specified in the appropriate legislation.</p>

<p><strong>Indictable offences that may be dealt with summarily</strong> (not
certain offences including rape, aggravated sexual assault, murder, treason and
piracy) when:</p>
<ul><li>The accused, when before the District Court, pleads guilty and</li>
  <li>The judge is satisfied that the accused understands the charge and</li>
  <li>The Director of Public Prosecutions consents</li>
</ul><p>If the case is not dealt with by the District Court, the accused is sent
forward to the Circuit Court for sentence. At the Circuit Court, he/she may
withdraw his/her plea of "guilty" and alter it to "not guilty", in which case a
trial takes place.</p>

<p><strong>Indictable offences not triable summarily</strong>, that is, cases
that must be heard by a judge and jury. In these cases, the accused is served
with a "Book of Evidence", i.e., a statement of the charge and of the evidence
intended to be introduced to the court and a list of witnesses and exhibits.
The Disrtict Court Judge no longer considers the material and submissions, on
behalf of the accused or the prosecution, to decide whether there is a
sufficient case. This was the process known as preliminary examination and has
been abolished. The District Court Judge will send the accused forward to the
Circuit Court or Central Criminal Court for trial once the book of evidence has
been served and the DPP has consented to sending the case forward.</p>

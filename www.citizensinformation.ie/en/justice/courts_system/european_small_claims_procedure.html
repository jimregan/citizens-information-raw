<p>The European Small Claims Procedure provides an inexpensive and easy way for
someone to pursue a cross-border claim without the need to employ a solicitor.
Similar to the <a shape="rect" href="small_claims_court.html">Small Claims
Court</a> it can be used in civil and in commercial matters. The claim cannot
exceed €2,000. It is an alternative to other options that may exist under the
national laws of EU member states. </p>

<p>The procedure was established under <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1466676798480&amp;uri=URISERV:l16028">EU
Regulation No. 861/2007</a> and implemented in Ireland by <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2008/en/si/0533.html">SI 533 of 2008</a>.
It is available in all member states except Denmark since January 2009.</p>

<h3>What cases does it apply to?</h3>

<p>The procedure applies to cross-border cases. In other words, the party with
whom you are in dispute must be domiciled or habitually resident in another
member state and you are pursuing the action in Ireland. It allows you, for
example, to make a claim in Ireland for a faulty product which you bought
online from someone living in another EU country. </p>

<p>The procedure does not apply to:</p>
<ul><li>Revenue, customs or administrative matters </li>
  <li>The liability of the State </li>
  <li>The status or legal capacity of an individual </li>
  <li>Property rights arising from marriage, maintenance obligations or wills
    and successions </li>
  <li>Bankruptcy, compositions and similar proceedings </li>
  <li>Social security </li>
  <li>Arbitration </li>
  <li>Employment law </li>
  <li>Tenancies of immovable property, except for monetary claims </li>
  <li>Violations of privacy and of rights relating to personality, including
    defamation </li>
</ul><h3>How do I start the procedure in Ireland?</h3>

<p>You must fill out a European Small Claims Procedure claim form, giving
details of your claim, the amount you are seeking and any other details
required. The amount claimed cannot exceed €2,000, excluding interest and
expenses. You must then lodge it with the Registrar in your local District
Court office. The claim and any other supporting documentation must be in
English or Irish, Ireland’s official languages.</p>

<p>If your claim is outside the scope of the procedure (see above), the
Registrar will notify you. If you do not provide enough information, the
Registrar will send you a form asking for the missing information. Your claim
will be rejected if you fail to complete or correct the claim in the time
specified, or if it clearly has no basis.</p>

<p>If your claim is not withdrawn or rejected, the Registrar will proceed with
it. </p>

<h3>How is the defendant notified?</h3>

<p>Once the Registrar has received the properly filled out claim form, a
standard answer form is prepared. This form, together with a copy of the claim
form and any supporting documentation, is served on the defendant by post
within 14 days. The defendant has 30 days to respond and must respond in
English or Irish. </p>

<p>Within 14 days of receiving the defendant’s response, the Registrar
forwards a copy of it and any supporting documentation to you. </p>

<p>If either you or the defendant refuses to accept documentation because it is
not in a language you or the defendant understands, the court will ask the
other party to supply a translation. </p>

<p>The defendant can also submit a counterclaim on a European Small Claims
Procedure claim form to which you have 30 days to reply after it is served on
you. If the counterclaim is for more than €2,000, both your original claim
and the counterclaim will be dealt with under the normal legal procedures that
apply to the courts rather than under the European Small Claim Procedure. </p>

<h3>When is the judgement given? </h3>

<p>Where the defendant contests the claim the Registrar will attempt to
negotiate a solution between you and the defendant. If this fails, the claim is
referred to the District Court for judgement.</p>

<p>The District Court gives its judgement within 30 days of receiving the
response from the defendant. If there is a counterclaim, the judgement is given
within 30 days of your response. </p>

<p>However, the court can decide to ask for further information from either or
both parties (30 days to reply). It may hold an oral hearing at either the
defendant’s or your request. This can be done by video conference or similar
procedure. In these situations, the court gives its judgement within 30 days of
getting the information or holding the oral hearing.</p>

<p>If either or both parties do not reply in time, the court still gives its
judgement.</p>

<p>At your request, the court will issue you with a certificate of judgement.
</p>

<h3>How do I enforce the judgement?</h3>

<p>Enforcement of the judgement is governed by the law of the EU member state
where you want the judgement enforced. You are required to provide to the court
in the member state an original copy of the judgement and the certificate of
judgement. The certificate has to be translated into the language of the member
state. You cannot be required to provide any security, bond or deposit on the
grounds that you are a foreign national or you are not domiciled or resident in
that member state. </p>

<p>Whether the defendant can appeal against the judgement depends on the
procedural law of the member state. </p>

<p>At the request of the defendant, the court in the member state can refuse to
enforce the judgment where the judgment is irreconcilable with an earlier
judgment on the same matter. The irreconcilability of the judgments must not
have been raised as an objection in the proceedings of the European Small
Claims Procedure. Also, the earlier judgment must have been given in the member
state or was capable of being recognised there. </p>

<p>If the defendant challenges or applies for a review of the judgment, the
court in the member state can: </p>
<ul><li>Limit the enforcement procedure to protective measures </li>
  <li>Make enforcement conditional on some security </li>
  <li>Stay the enforcement proceedings in exceptional circumstances </li>
</ul><p>The defendant can also apply for a review to the District Court where you
obtained the judgment where: </p>
<ul><li>The claim form or summons to an oral hearing was not served by a method
    which provides proof of receipt by the defendant personally </li>
  <li>The service was not effected in time for the defendant to prepare a
    defence, without any fault on the defendant’s part </li>
  <li>The defendant was prevented from objecting to the claim by reasons of
    force majeure or due to extraordinary circumstances, without any fault on
    the defendant’s part </li>
</ul><p>The defendant must act promptly. When a review is considered justified, the
original judgment becomes null and void.</p>

<p>The fee for the European Small Claims Procedure is €25.</p>

<p>You may have to pay for the translation of your documents if they are in a
language the defendant does not understand. If you win you can claim for such
additional costs. If you lose, however, you may have to pay for any translation
or other costs incurred by the defendant. </p>

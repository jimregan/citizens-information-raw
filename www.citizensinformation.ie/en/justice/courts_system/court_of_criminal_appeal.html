<p>Under the Court of Appeal Act 2014, the Court of Criminal Appeal was
abolished. Appeals arising since 28 October 2014 are heard by the new <a href="court_of_appeal.html">Court of Appeal</a>. </p>

<p>The Court of Criminal Appeal consisted of a Judge of the Supreme Court and
two Judges of the High Court. It heard appeals against conviction or sentence
from the Circuit Criminal Court, the Central Criminal Court and the Special
Criminal Court and appeals against leniency of sentence only by the Director of
Public Prosecutions.</p>

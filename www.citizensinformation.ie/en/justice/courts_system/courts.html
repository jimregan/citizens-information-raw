<p>There are four main courts in Ireland: the District Court, the Circuit
Court, the High Court and the Supreme Court. Other courts in operation are the
Special Criminal Court and the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>Articles 34 to 37 of Bunreacht na hEireann (<a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">the
Irish Constitution</a>) deal with the administration of justice in general and
outline the structure of the court system. Article 34.1 states that: "Justice
shall be administered in courts established by law..." The present courts were
set up by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1961/en/act/pub/0038/index.html">Courts
(Establishment and Constitution) Act 1961</a> (as amended). </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="district_court.html">District Court</a> has
jurisdiction over minor civil and criminal matters. You can appeal the outcome
of a case heard in the District Court to the Circuit Court. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="circuit_court.html">Circuit Court</a> has
jurisdiction in more serious civil and criminal matters. You can appeal the
outcome of a case heard in the Circuit Court to the High Court. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="high_court.html">High Court</a> is presided over
by a President of the High Court. It also has jurisdiction over civil and
criminal matters. For example, the most serious criminal offences, such as
murder, are dealt with by the High Court. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="court_of_appeal.html">Court of Appeal</a> hears
appeals from cases heard in the Circuit Court and High Court.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="supreme_court.html">Supreme Court</a> was created
as the final court of appeal and is presided over by the Chief Justice.</p>

<p>Though courts can have jurisdiction over both civil and criminal matters,
the <a shape="rect" href="special_criminal_court.html">Special Criminal
Court</a> only deals with criminal cases.</p>

<p>The Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Act 1961 also provides for the
setting up of special courts where the best interest of justice would not be
served in a normal court, for example, the <a shape="rect" href="children_court.html">Children's Court</a> and the Drug Court.</p>

<p>The courts are supported by the Offices of the Courts. For example, the <a shape="rect" href="office_of_wards_of_court.html">Office of the Ward of
Court</a> is responsible for the supervision of the affairs of people taken
into the wardship of the High Court.</p>

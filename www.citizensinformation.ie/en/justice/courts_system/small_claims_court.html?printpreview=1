<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The aim of the small claims procedure (also known as the small claims court)
is to provide an inexpensive, fast and easy way for consumers and businesses to
resolve disputes without the need to employ a solicitor. The person who is
making the claim is known as the <em>claimant</em>. The person you are claiming
against is known as the <em>respondent</em>. Both the claimant and the
respondent must be living or based within the State. If either party lives or
is based in another EU member state, the <a href="european_small_claims_procedure.html">European Small Claims
Procedure</a> should be used.</p>

<p>The small claims procedure is provided by the local District Court
offices.</p>

<p>The procedure can be used to resolve consumer complaints. Certain other
types of disputes are also eligible. Since January 2010, businesses can make
claims against other businesses.</p>

<p>The claim cannot exceed €2,000.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Types of claim</h3>

<p>The following types of consumer claims can be dealt with under the small
claims procedure:</p>
<ul><li>Consumer claims such as for faulty goods or bad workmanship. You must
    have bought the goods or service for private use from someone selling them
    in the course of business. </li>
  <li>Claims can also be made for minor damage to your property. </li>
  <li>Claims for the non-return of a rent deposit for certain kinds of rented
    properties, such as, a holiday home or a flat in a premises where the
    landlord also lives. </li>
</ul><p>Consumer claims cannot be made through the small claims procedure for debts,
personal injuries or breach of leasing or hire-purchase agreements. </p>

<p>Businesses can make claims against other businesses in relation to contracts
for goods or services purchased. It does not apply to claims in relation to:</p>
<ul><li>Agreements to which the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Consumer
    Credit Act 1995</a> applies </li>
  <li>Breaches of leasing agreements </li>
  <li>Debt or liquidated damages </li>
</ul><h3>Summary of procedure</h3>

<p>The procedure is designed to deal with claims up to €2,000 and can be
summarised as follows:</p>
<ul><li>The claimant completes the application form and sends it to the <a href="http://www.courts.ie/Courts.ie/Library3.nsf/pagecurrent/1CB37D1F4D12562B8025810D0037EFDC?opendocument&amp;l=en">Small
    Claims Registrar</a> with the relevant fee or applies online </li>
  <li>The application is registered by the Registrar </li>
  <li>A copy of the claim and a Notice of Claim is sent by the Registrar to the
    respondent </li>
</ul><p>At this stage, there are various choices available to the respondent: </p>
<ul><li>They can admit the claim </li>
  <li>They can dispute the claim </li>
  <li>They can counterclaim </li>
  <li>They might ignore the claim. </li>
</ul><h3>Respondent admits the claim</h3>

<p>The respondent has 15 calendar days to reply. Where the respondent admits
the claim, they complete a Notice of Acceptance of Liability and return it to
the Registrar</p>

<p>The respondent has 3 options:</p>
<ol><li>The respondent agrees to pay the amount claimed. Here, the respondent
    agrees to pay you immediately. Payment is made by cheque, postal order or
    money order, made payable to the claimant, and sent to the Registrar. If
    payment is conditional, for example the goods must be returned, then the
    Registrar must seek the claimant's agreement </li>
  <li>The respondent consents to judgement. Here, the respondent will only pay
    you when judgement is made in the <a href="district_court.html">District
    Court</a>. You do not have to attend at court. The claimant swears an
    Affidavit of Debt and makes a request for Judgement and Decree. The
    Registrar will assist the claimant in this procedure. The Registrar will
    notify the respondent of the judgement. The respondent has 28 calendar days
    to comply with the judgement. </li>
  <li>The respondent wishes to pay the amount claimed in instalments. The
    Registrar must inform the claimant of this request and must seek the
    consent of the claimant to the terms proposed. </li>
</ol><h3>Respondent disputes the claim</h3>

<p>The respondent has 15 calendar days to reply and returns to the Registrar
the Notice of Dispute within the 15 calendar day period. The Registrar sends
the claimant a copy of the Notice of Dispute and tries to settle the dispute.
</p>

<p>If no settlement can be reached, the matter is then set down for a hearing
in the District Court.</p>

<h3>The respondent counterclaims</h3>

<p>The respondent outlines their intention to counterclaim on the Notice of
Dispute and sends the appropriate fee to the Registrar. The Registrar sends the
claimant a copy of the Notice of Dispute and Counterclaim.</p>

<h3>The respondent does not reply to the claim</h3>

<p>The respondent has 15 calendar days to reply to the claim. Where there is no
reply by the respondent, they are then held to have admitted the claim. The
procedure is the same as if they had consented to judgement. The claimant
swears an Affidavit of Debt and makes a request for Judgement and Decree. The
Registrar will assist the claimant in this procedure. The Registrar will notify
the respondent of the judgement. The respondent has 28 calendar days to comply
with the judgement.</p>

<h3>Enforcing your judgement</h3>

<p>Once you have obtained judgement and have a decree, there is the possibility
that the respondent will not comply with the order of the court. In this
situation, you may need to enforce your judgement. The most usual way of
enforcing a judgement is to give the decree to the Sheriff or County Registrar
for execution.</p>

<p>You have to apply to the Small Claims Registrar to have the decree sent to
you. The Registrar will not automatically send you the decree for execution in
this way. After you give the decree to the Sheriff or County Registrar, they
then go to the respondent and seize goods or money to the value of the amount
set out in your decree.</p>

<p>It will involve a fee, payable to the Sheriff or County Registrar. If the
Sheriff or County Registrar successfully executes the judgement, this fee will
be refunded to you.</p>

<p>Information and assistance on enforcement procedures is available from the
Small Claims Registrar.</p>

<h3>Court hearing</h3>

<p>If your case has been <a href="../civil_law/small_claims_and_a_court_hearing.html">referred for a
hearing in the District Court</a>, you will receive a letter from the District
Court office telling you the date and time of the court hearing and the
location of the court itself. The case will be heard in public as part of a
normal sitting of the District Court. It may be advisable to get <a href="../courtroom/solicitors.html">legal advice</a>.</p>

<p>Under Irish law, a business is required to be legally represented in
court-based proceedings.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The current fee for making a claim through the small claims procedure is
€25. This fee is payable by cheque or postal order. The Small Claims
Registrar will accept the fee in cash if you pay it in person. If you apply
online, you are required to pay online.</p>

<p>If your claim is accepted as suitable for the small claims procedure the fee
is not refunded, even if your claim is successful.</p>

claims procedure</a> on its website.</p>

<h2>Completing the application form</h2>

<p>Before you begin to fill in the application form, the following information
will be useful to help explain the various parts of the form. There are 3
distinct sections to the form.</p>

<h3>Claimant </h3>

<p>The person taking the claim is the claimant. This section is for your
personal details. Here you should enter your name and address. It is important
to make sure that the correct person is making the claim. The person who bought
the faulty goods or the person who ordered the work to be carried out should be
the one to take the claim. Likewise, the person whose property has been damaged
should be the one making the claim. </p>

<h3>Respondent </h3>

<p>This section is for the details of the person or company you are making the
claim against. You must make the claim against a person or a company. Often you
may not know who owns the shop you bought the faulty goods from. It is not
enough to just put the name of the shop on the application form. You must
investigate who owns the shop. </p>

<p>You can do this by making a companies search in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.cro.ie/">Companies Registration Office</a>. Here you will find
a register of all the companies in the country. If the shop is not registered
as a company, try a business name search, also in the Companies Registration
Office. If the respondent resides outside of Ireland, you should ask them to
nominate, in writing, someone in this country (usually their agent or
solicitor) to accept proceedings on their behalf. </p>

<h3>Claim </h3>

<p>In this section, you should set out the facts of your case clearly and
simply. </p>
<ul><li>When did you buy the goods/services? When was your property damaged? When
    did you rent the property? </li>
  <li>Who is your claim against? </li>
  <li>What went wrong? </li>
  <li>How did you deal with it? </li>
  <li>Why are you taking court action? </li>
  <li>How much are you claiming for? </li>
</ul><p>It is important to include the amount for which you are claiming. If the
claim is not disputed, you may get judgement without having to go to court.
Bear in mind that you can normally only claim the amount for which you are
directly out of pocket, in other words, the amount you paid for the faulty
goods and/or any cost involved in having them repaired. It is therefore a good
idea to keep all receipts and documentation to show what these amounts are. </p>

<p>Sometimes the Small Claims Court may allow you to claim some general damage
where there was distress caused to you by a faulty product or service. A good
example of this is where a holiday goes disastrously wrong. You can <a shape="rect" href="/en/consumer_affairs/travel/package_holidays.html">read more

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The criminal law gives the Gardaí certain powers to detain you in their
custody after you have been arrested. The purpose of detaining you after your
arrest is twofold:</p>
<ul><li>To ensure that you appear before a court to answer charges </li>
  <li>To ensure that criminal offences are properly investigated </li>
</ul><p>It is important to understand that the powers of detention depend on the
offence for which you have been arrested.</p>

<p>If you are charged and brought before the District Court, you may be either
released on bail or detained in custody while waiting for your trial. This is
called being <em>on remand</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l162fd">Detention before being charged</h2>

<p>If you are arrested for an offence which does not allow for your detention,
then you must be charged with that offence and brought before a judge of the
District Court as soon as possible. If you are arrested after 5pm on any
evening and the <a shape="rect" href="../courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a> is sitting
before noon the following day, it is acceptable to bring you before the
District Court at the beginning of that sitting.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you are arrested for an offence which allows for your
detention in a Garda station to assist with a Garda investigation, then you
will normally be detained for the period allowed by law.</p>

<p>The main pieces of legislation that govern detention after arrest are:</p>
<ul><li>Section 4 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1984/en/act/pub/0022/index.html">Criminal
    Justice Act 1984</a> </li>
  <li>Section 42 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1999/en/act/pub/0010/index.html">Criminal
    Justice Act 1999</a> </li>
  <li>Section 30 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1939/en/act/pub/0013/index.html">Offences
    Against the State Act 1939</a> </li>
  <li>Section 2 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0029/index.html">Criminal
    Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996</a> </li>
  <li>Section 50 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/act/pub/0029/index.html">Criminal
    Justice Act 2007</a> </li>
  <li>Sections 16 and 17 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0027/index.html">Criminal
    Procedure Act 2010</a></li>
</ul><p>These pieces of legislation recognise the concept of detention after arrest
by the Gardaí to assist with their investigations. Tthe Gardaí must have
reasonable grounds for believing your detention is necessary to properly
investigate the offence.</p>

<p>See "Further information" below on the offences to which detention
applies.</p>

<h3>How long can I be detained for?</h3>

<p>The maximum period of detention ranges from 24 hours to 7 days depending on
which section of the legislation you are being detained under. In most cases,
you can be initially detained for up to 6 hours on the authorisation of the
member in charge of the Garda station. For offences under Section 30 of the
Offences Against the State Act 1939 your initial detention period can be up to
24 hours. To detain you under Section 42 of the Criminal Justce Act 1999 the
Gardaí have to first obtain a warrant from the District Court authorising your
arrest and initial detention. You can then be taken from the prison to a Garda
station.</p>

<p>Generally, after your initial period of detention ends, up to 2 further
detention periods can be authorised by a Garda of the rank of Superintendent or
higher. Depending on the section of the law applying to your detention, the
authorisation for a further extension may have to be given by a Garda of the
rank of Chief Superintendent or higher.</p>

<p>Further periods of detention may be granted following application to the
District or Circuit Court by a Garda of the rank of Chief Superintendent or
higher. For Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939 application
can be made to the District Court by the Superintendent.</p>

<p>The periods of detention applying under the various sections of legislation
are given in the following table:

    </tr></tbody></table><p>Note 1: First extension must be authorised by a Garda Chief Superintendent
(or higher rank).</p>

<p>Note 2: The extension is authorised by the District Court following
application by a Garda Superintendent. </p>

<p>If you are arrested under Sections 16 or 17 of the Criminal Procedure Act
2010 the periods of detention applying are the same as those applying to
Section 4 detentions (see table above).</p>

<h3>Does the clock stop at any time during my detention?</h3>

<p>It may. If, during your detention, you are taken from the Garda station to a
hospital or other suitable place for medical attention, any period of absence
from the Garda station is not taken into account in the calculation of your
detention. </p>

<p>Other periods may not be counted, depending on the section of legislation
you are detained under. If you are detained under Section 4 or Section 42 and
questioning is suspended for a period of time between midnight and 8am to allow
you to rest, the time the questioning is suspended is not counted. Also, if you
are certified by a doctor as unfit for questioning, the time the questioning is
suspended is not counted. While you are waiting to consult your solicitor and
no questioning is taking place, that time is not counted.</p>

<p>If you are detained under Sections 4, 42 or 50 and you attend court in
connection with an application relating to the lawfulness of your detention,
the time you are absent from the Garda station is not counted</p>

<p>If your period of detention would end while you are at the venue where an
application is being made by the Gardaí for a further detention period, it is
considered not to end until the final decision of the court on the
application.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0022/index.html">Criminal
Justice Act 2011</a> amended detention under Section 4 for certain <a href="../criminal_law/criminal_offences/classification_of_crimes_in_criminal_cases.html">arrestable
offences</a> to allow your detention to be suspended and for you to be released
during the suspension. These offences include offences in the areas of banking
and finance, company law, money laundering, fraud, corruption, competition,
consumer protection and cybercrime.</p>

<h3>Can children be detained?</h3>

<p>Apart from detention under Section 30, the detention of suspects who are
under 12 years of age is not allowed. If, however, the member in charge of the
Garda station has reasonable grounds for believing that the suspect is not
below the age of 12 years, this prohibition does not apply. It will be
necessary for the member in charge to justify these grounds if it transpires
subsequently that the suspect was in fact under 12 years of age. <a shape="rect" href="../children_and_young_offenders/treatment_of_child_suspects_in_garda_custody.html">More
information on the treatment of children in Garda custody is available
here</a>.</p>

<h3>What happens when my detention ends?</h3>

<p>If the Gardaí no longer have any grounds for believing that your detention
is necessary to properly investigate the offence or your detention period has
expired, then you must be either charged with the offence or released from
custody. If you are being charged with the offence you are brought before the
court.</p>

<p>If you are detained under Section 42 and your detention is no longer
required or it has expired, you are returned to prison without being
charged.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l2589c">Detention for administrative purposes</h2>

<p>There are a number of other instances where you may be detained by Gardaí.
These could be described as detention for administrative purposes and don't
require the authorisation of anybody other than the arresting Garda.</p>

<p>Examples of this are:</p>
<ul><li>Detention after arrest for drink driving for the purpose of providing a
    sample of blood, urine or a breath specimen </li>
  <li>Detention after arrest for the purpose of being charged with an offence
  </li>
  <li>Detention after arrest for the purpose of submitting to a drugs search
  </li>
  <li>Detention under the Mental Treatment Acts </li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lc10c8">On remand in custody</h2>

<p>When you are brought to the District Court for the first time after you are
charged, the court has 2 options:</p>
<ul><li>It may remand you in custody for a period of no longer than 8 days. This
    means that you are detained in custody until a particular date when you
    will be brought back before the court. This date is called the <em>remand
    date</em>. If you are remanded in custody in Dublin, you will be brought to
    Cloverhill Prison. </li>
  <li>It may remand you on <a shape="rect" href="bail_and_surety.html">bail</a>
    for a period that is longer than 8 days if you and the prosecution consent.
    This means that you are released on bail but you must appear before the
    Court on a particular date (the remand date). </li>
</ul><p>When you are brought before the District Court for the second and subsequent
times, the court has 2 options:</p>
<ul><li>It may remand you in custody for a period of 15 days or less. </li>
  <li>It may remand you in custody for a period of 16 to 30 days, if you and
    the prosecution consent. </li>
</ul><p>If you are unable to go to court due to illness, the court may remand you in
custody in your absence.</p>

<p>If you have been remanded in custody and there is no sitting of the court on
the remand date, you will be remanded in custody to the next sitting of a court
in the same District Court District.</p>

<p>If you have been remanded on bail and there is no sitting of the court on
the remand date, you will be remanded to the next sitting of a court in the
same District Court Area.</p>

<p>If you are remanded in custody for a period of 4 days or less, the court may
commit you to the custody of the Gardaí. This means that you are kept at a
Garda station instead of in a prison.</p>

<h2>Offences to which detention applies</h2>

<h3>Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984</h3>

<p>A Section 4 detention applies to any offence for which an adult (who hasn't
been previously convicted), may be punished by imprisonment for a term of five
years or more. Most offences for which you can be arrested carry a penalty like
this, so they come within the scope of Section 4. </p>

<h3>Section 42 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999</h3>

<p>Section 42 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999 allows the Gardaí to arrest a
prisoner who is serving a sentence or awaiting trial. The detention must be in
relation to an <em>arrestable</em> offence or offences other than the one for
which you are in prison. (Note: an <a shape="rect" href="../criminal_law/criminal_offences/classification_of_crimes_in_criminal_cases.html">arrestable
offence</a> means an offence for which you could be punished by imprisonment
for five years or more).</p>

<h3>Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939</h3>

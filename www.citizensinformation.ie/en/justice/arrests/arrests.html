<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>An arrest is the apprehending or restraining of a person to bring that
person to a District Court within a reasonable time.</p>

<p>You can not be arrested for the purpose of gathering <a shape="rect" href="../evidence/evidence_introduction.html">evidence</a> or 'helping the
Gardai with their enquiries'. </p>

<p>You must be told why you are being arrested, for example, because you are
suspected of having stolen goods. However, if you are arrested under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1939/en/act/pub/0013/sec0030.html#zza13y1939s30">Section
30</a> of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1939/en/act/pub/0013/index.html">Offences
Against the State Act 1939</a>, you do not have to be told exactly why you are
being arrested, you need only be told that you are being arrested under that
section. </p>

<p>If you go voluntarily to a Garda station to assist the Gardai with their
enquiries and are subjected to questioning or interrogation, you must be told
and it must be clear to you that you are free to leave the station at any time
unless you are arrested. </p>

<p>Often an arrest is on foot of a warrant. However, a warrant is not always
necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Arrest without a warrant </h3>

<p>You may be arrested without a warrant when a Garda, with reasonable cause,
suspects that an arrestable offence has been committed and that you are guilty
of the offence (<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0014/sec0004.html#sec4">Section
4 of the Criminal Law Act 1997</a>). An 'arrestable offence' is an offence for
which the penalty, for a person who has no previous convictions, can be 5 years
imprisonment or more. Specific laws give the Gardaí specific powers of arrest
as well. For example, a Garda can arrest you under the Road Traffic Acts
without a warrant if he/she suspects that you are committing an offence in
relation to drinking and driving </p>

<h3>Entry and search of a premises to carry out an arrest</h3>

<p>If a Garda has obtained a warrant to arrest you, he or she may enter and
search any premises where he or she suspects you to be. He or she must identify
himself or herself, demand entry and state why he or she is there. If the Garda
is refused entry, he or she may break open outer and inner doors to get in.</p>

<p>When a Garda does not have an arrest warrant, he or she may enter and search
any premises where he or she, with reasonable cause, suspects you to be.
However, if the premises is a dwelling and he or she does not have the
permission of the person who lives in the dwelling, the Garda cannot enter
unless :</p>
<ul><li>You live at the dwelling </li>
  <li>The Garda has seen you inside or entering the dwelling or </li>
  <li>The Garda, with reasonable cause, suspects that before he or she can get
    an arrest warrant, you will either abscond or you will obstruct the course
    of justice or </li>
  <li>He or she, with reasonable cause, suspects that before he or she can get
    an arrest warrant, you will commit an offence </li>
</ul><h3>Manner of arrest</h3>

<p>Force can only be used to make an arrest if it is absolutely necessary. </p>

<p>When a Garda arrests you, he or she will actually touch your body or
otherwise restrain your liberty. If you are arrested on a criminal charge, you
must be informed at the time you are arrested of the charge unless this is very
clear (for example, if you are arrested while committing an offence). </p>

<p>After you have been charged, the Garda must caution you with the following
words: "You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but
whatever you say will be taken down in writing and may be given in
evidence."</p>

<p>When you are brought to the Garda station, details of the offence must be
set out in a 'charge sheet'. A copy of the details must be given to you. The
Garda will formally charge you by reading each charge over to you and you will
be cautioned after each charge is read out. The Garda must keep a note of any
reply you make.</p>

<h3>Search of the arrested person</h3>

<p>A Garda may search you after your arrest and take </p>
<ul><li>articles that he or she believes to be connected with, or evidence
    relating to, the offence charged or </li>
  <li>articles that he or she believes to be connected with, or evidence
    relating to, some other offence or </li>
  <li>articles that you might use to injure another person or property or to
    escape </li>
</ul><h3>Procedure after arrest</h3>

<p>Once you are charged and cautioned, you must be</p>
<ul><li>released on bail by the member in charge of the station (a form of bail
    known as station bail) </li>
  <li>transferred from the Garda Station to the District Court as soon as
    reasonably possible. If you are arrested after 5 p.m. you may be brought to
    the District Court as early as possible before noon the following day. At
    the District Court, you may be released on <a shape="rect" href="bail_and_surety.html">bail</a> or <a shape="rect" href="detention_after_arrest.html">remanded in custody</a> by the judge.
  </li>
</ul><p>Only in certain specific circumstances may you be detained in a Garda
Station for a length of time before being brought to court. Under the Criminal
Justice Act 1984, you may be detained in a Garda Station for up to 12 hours.
The offence of which you are suspected must be one that may be punished by
imprisonment for at least 5 years. The 12 hour period runs from the time of
your arrest but you may agree to a rest period between 12 midnight and 8 am and
this will not be included in the 12 hours. </p>

<p>In general, if you are arrested you do not have to say anything. However, if
you are detained under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1984/en/act/pub/0022/index.html">Criminal
Justice Act 1984</a> you must tell the Gardai your name and address. The Gardai
have no general power to take fingerprints or make forensic tests. They may do
these things if you consent or if they have specific power under specific laws,
for example, under the Offences Against the State Act or the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1976/en/act/pub/0014/index.html">Criminal
Law (Jurisdiction) Act of 1976</a>. Under Section 30 of the Offences Against
the State Act you may be detained for up to 48 hours before being brought to
Court. </p>

<p>If you are detained you must be informed of your right to consult a
solicitor. See our document on <a href="treatment_in_custody.html">treatment
in custody</a>.</p>

<h3>Immunity from arrest</h3>
<ul><li>Ambassadors and their suites and other diplomatic agents who represent
    foreign governments while living in this country cannot be arrested. </li>
  <li>Members of each House of the Oireachtas cannot be arrested while going
    to, returning from and within the confines of either House of the
    Oireachtas, except in the case of treason, felony or breach of peace. </li>

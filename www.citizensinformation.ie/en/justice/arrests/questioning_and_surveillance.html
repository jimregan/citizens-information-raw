<p>When the <a shape="rect" href="../law_enforcement/garda_siochana_national_police_force.html">Gardaí</a>
are investigating and detecting crime they are entitled to observe the actions
of any individual. However the Gardaí must, stay within the confines of the
law when questioning members of the public. To do this, the Gardaí are given
certain powers to stop and question the public.</p>

<p>Where a Garda is investigating a criminal offence, the Garda is entitled to
seek the co-operation of anyone by asking the person questions about what
he/she saw or heard. However, while the Gardaí are entitled to question
members of the public, there is no legal obligation to answer any such
questions or to co-operate with the Gardaí.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="ld1912">Questioning</h2>

<h3>Common law powers </h3>

<p>Most of the powers given to the Gardaí to stop and question members of the
public are set out in law (known as statutory powers). There are, however, a
number of instances where a Garda is entitled to stop and question you where no
statutory power exists. This is known as a <em>common law power</em>. </p>

<p>An example of this would be where a Garda observes you acting suspiciously
late at night, in an area where a lot of crimes are being committed. The Garda
is entitled to stop you in order to detect and prevent crime. You are under no
legal obligation to co-operate with the Garda and the Garda cannot use force to
restrain your freedom under common law, short of <a shape="rect" href="arrests.html">arresting</a> you. </p>

<p>However, if the Garda has reasonable grounds for suspecting that you
committed an offence, the Garda can use a statutory power to demand your name
and address. If you refuse to provide them, then the Garda can arrest you.</p>

<p>The Gardaí have a common law power to stop motorists at random in order to
detect and prevent crime. This power can be used, for example, to stop cars
near pubs to identify drunk drivers or in order to check cars passing through
an area where a lot of crime had been committed.</p>

<h3>Statutory powers</h3>

<p>As outlined above, a Garda is entitled to stop a motorist under common law
for the purpose of detecting and preventing crime. The Garda is also entitled
to stop a motorist under a statutory power given under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1961/en/act/pub/0024/sec0109.html#zza24y1961s109">Section
109 of the Road Traffic Act 1961</a>, which obliges a motorist to stop his/her
vehicle when required to do so by a Garda. This statutory power is given to the
Gardaí for the purpose of inspecting vehicle tax, insurance certificates,
driving licenses and road worthiness of vehicles. Unlike common law power, it
is confined to road traffic offences.</p>

<p>There are a considerable number of statutory provisions which allow the
Gardaí to stop anyone for certain purposes, but there is only one which
specifically permits a Garda to stop and question someone, short of arresting
the person. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1939/en/act/pub/0013/sec0030.html#zza13y1939s30">Section
30 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939</a> allows a Garda to stop and
interrogate anyone whom the Garda suspects of having committed or being about
to commit an offence under the 1939 Act or an offence scheduled for the
purposes of the Act. (There are a number of offences listed as being scheduled
offences, such as, firearms offences and explosive offences). This gives the
Gardaí the power to stop a suspect in a public place. It also gives them the
power to stop any vehicle, or any ship, boat or other vessel for the purposes
of questioning and searching, and if necessary, arresting the suspect.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l9244b">Surveillance</h2>

<p>It is commonplace for the Gardaí to use surveillance on people and
locations in their efforts to detect and prevent crime. Surveillance is used in
a number of situations. If, for example, you are suspected of being involved in
criminal activities you may be placed under surveillance. Similarly, when the
Gardaí have information that a crime is to be committed at a certain place
they may decide to place that premises or location under surveillance. The
decision to place a person or premises under surveillance is primarily one for
the Gardaí but must be made within the law. </p>

<p>Everyone in Ireland enjoys the freedom to observe the movements of others
and, indeed, to observe the property of others. While this is true, the manner
of such observations cannot be such as to cause alarm or distress to another
person. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0026/sec0010.html#zza26y1997s10">Section
10 of the Non-fatal Offences Against the Persons Act 1997</a> protects you from
being <em>stalked </em>or harassed. While such protection exists, it is
unlikely that this protection could be used to stop Garda surveillance since
you would not normally be aware that the Gardaí have you under surveillance.
</p>

<p>Another protection you have with regard to surveillance is the <a shape="rect" href="../../government_in_ireland/irish_constitution_1/constitution_fundamental_rights.html">constitutional
right to privacy</a> which is a fundamental right of everyone. The possible
breach of this right to privacy relates to surveillance being carried out by
neighbours, husbands or wives, private investigators or stalkers. The courts
have not shown any willingness to use this protection in cases where the
surveillance was being conducted by the Gardaí in the investigation, detection
and prevention of crime. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0019/index.html">Criminal
Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009</a>, which became law in July 2009, provides a
statutory framework for evidence obtained by secret surveillance. It is
intended that such surveillance be used to combat serious criminal, subversive
or terrorist activity. The Act provides for a judicial authorisation procedure
for surveillance and a complaints procedure. </p>

<h3>Interception of phone calls and packages</h3>

<p>Under the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages
(Regulation) Act 1993 there are statutory provisions which give the Gardaí the
power to use technology for the purpose of keeping people under surveillance.
An example of this is the power given to the Gardaí to intercept a telephone
call for the purpose of investigating criminal offences. This power is granted
by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/Our_ministers">Minister for Justice
and Equality</a>. </p>

<p>The Minister may also authorise the interception and opening of postal
letters and packages. Only the Garda Commissioner can apply for such
authorisation in relation to criminal offences. The Garda Commissioner and the
Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces (Army) can apply for authorisation in
relation to state security. </p>

<p>The operation of these intercepts is monitored by the President of the <a shape="rect" href="../courts_system/high_court.html">High Court</a> who is
responsible for ensuring the intercepts are confined to those which are
authorised by the Minister. </p>

<p>It is a criminal offence for someone to intercept a telephone call, letter
or package addressed to someone else, without legal authorisation. </p>

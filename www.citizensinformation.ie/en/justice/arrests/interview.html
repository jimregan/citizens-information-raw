<h3>If you are 18 years old or over</h3>

<p>You have a right to consult a solicitor before you are interviewed. If you
ask for a solicitor you cannot be questioned until they arrive, except in
exceptional circumstances. </p>

<p>Before you are interviewed, the Garda conducting the interview will identify
himself or herself and any other Garda in the room, by name and rank.</p>

<p>The interview must be conducted in a fair and humane manner.</p>

<p>No more than two Gardai can question you at any one time and no more than
four Gardai can be in the room at any one time during the interview.</p>

<p>If an interview has lasted for four hours, it must either be ended or
adjourned for a reasonable time.</p>

<p>As far as possible, interviews will take place in rooms set aside for
interviews only.</p>

<p>Except with the permission of the Garda in charge of the station, you may
not be questioned between midnight and 8 a.m. in relation to an offence.
Permission can only be given in exceptional circumstances or if you were
brought to the station during that time.</p>

<p>If you are deaf or there is doubt about your hearing ability, you cannot be
questioned without an interpreter, if one is reasonably available, unless you
give your written consent. If you have requested an interpreter and one is not
reasonably available, any questions will be put to you in writing.</p>

<p>If you are drunk or under the influence of drugs so that you are unable to
appreciate the significance of questions put to you or your answers, you cannot
be questioned while you are in that condition except with the permission of the
member in charge of the station. Permission can only be given in exceptional
circumstances </p>

<p>If, while you are being interviewed, you make a complaint to a Garda in
relation to your treatment while in custody, the Garda must notify the member
in charge of the station, if he or she is not present at the interview, and
record it.</p>

<p>A record must be kept of your interview either by the Garda conducting it or
by another Garda who is present. The record must include details of the time
the interview began and ended, any breaks in it, the place of the interview and
the names and ranks of the Gardai present.</p>

<p>If the interview is not electronically recorded, the record will be kept in
the Garda's notebook. </p>

<h3>If you are under 18 years old</h3>

<p>If you are under 18 years of age, you cannot be questioned unless a parent
or guardian is present. You have a right to consult a solicitor before you are
interviewed. </p>

<p>If it is not possible to get the parent or guardian you requested to come to
the interview, the member in charge of the station must try to arrange for your
other parent, another guardian, an adult relative or some other responsible
person other than a Garda to attend. </p>

<p>The member in charge of the station may give permission to question you
without a parent or guardian present in exceptional circumstances or if it has
not been possible to communicate with a parent or guardian or to get them to
attend within a reasonable time.</p>

<p>The member in charge may exclude your parent or guardian from the interview
if:</p>
<ul><li>your parent or guardian is the victim of the offence being investigated
  </li>
  <li>your parent or guardian has been arrested in relation to the offence or
    is a suspect, </li>
  <li>the member in charge has reasonable grounds for believing that your
    parent or guardian would obstruct the course of justice if he or she was at
    the interview. </li>

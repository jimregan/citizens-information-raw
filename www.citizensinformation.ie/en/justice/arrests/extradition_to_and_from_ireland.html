<p>Extradition means the transfer of someone from one country to another for
the purpose of prosecution or punishment for an offence of which they have been
convicted. In general, extradition is only possible if there is an extradition
agreement between the two countries in question. </p>

<p>This means that Ireland must have an agreement with the other country before
someone can be extradited to or from Ireland. Individual countries also have
specific rules about extradition. For example, Ireland does not allow
extradition for the purposes of investigation of a criminal offence only.</p>

<p>Since 2004, extradition between EU member states has been governed by the <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002F0584:EN:HTML">European
Arrest Warrant Framework Decision</a>. This has been implemented in Ireland by
the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0045/index.html">European
Arrest Warrant Act 2003</a>. Extradition to other countries from Ireland is
governed by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1965/en/act/pub/0017/index.html">Extradition
Act 1965</a> as amended. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Extradition from Ireland to non-EU Countries</h3>

<p>You may be extradited from Ireland to countries with which Ireland has
extradition agreements where certain conditions are met. </p>

<p>The most important conditions are:</p>
<ul><li><span>You are charged with an offence</span>: punished by imprisonment in
    Ireland and in the other country for at least a year. Or, you are convicted
    of such an offence, and a sentence of at least four months has been
    imposed. This principle, that the offence must be the same in the two
    countries is known as the principle of <span>dual criminality</span>. You
    may not be extradited if you are going to be held in custody for the
    purpose of investigation. </li>
  <li><span>The offence is not a political offence</span>: or one connected
    with a political offence. The definition of political offence was initially
    quite wide but has now been narrowed considerably. In general, it does not
    include terrorist type offences. </li>
  <li><span>The death penalty does not apply</span> to the offence. </li>
</ul><p>The authorities in the other country requesting your extradition from
Ireland, apply to the Minister for Justice and Equality for your extradition.
All extradition proceedings are then dealt with by the <a shape="rect" href="../courts_system/high_court.html">High Court</a>. The usual rules in
relation to criminal trials apply to extradition prodeedings.</p>

<h3>Extradition between EU member states - European Arrest Warrant </h3>

<p>Since 1 January 2004 a <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1422976274641&amp;uri=URISERV:l33167">European
Arrest Warrant (EAW)</a> valid throughout the EU has replaced extradition
procedures between EU member states. An European Arrest Warrant may be issued
by a national judicial authority if the person whose return is sought is
accused of an offence for which the maximum penalty is at least a year in
prison or if he or she has been sentenced to a prison term of at least four
months. </p>

<p>The European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 implements the procedures in Ireland.
It applies to extradition between two EU countries and does not affect
extradition to any other country.</p>

<p>The Irish legislation implements the EU framework decision of 13 June 2002
on the European Arrest Warrant. At the time that decision was adopted, Ireland
made a statement to the effect that it would implement the decision for the
purposes of bringing a person to trial or for the purpose of executing a
custodial sentence or detention order. The idea is to ensure that a person may
not be extradited from Ireland and kept in custody for investigation purposes.
As a general rule, it is not legal to arrest a person in Ireland in order to
investigate an offence, it is only legal to arrest them in order to charge them
with an offence. This is not the case in a number of EU countries. This
statement is reflected in the European Arrest Warrants Act 2003.</p>

<h3>Requirement for dual criminality</h3>

<p>Until January 2004, dual criminality was required in respect of all
offences. This meant that you could be extradited to face prosecution or
service of a sentence in another state only where the offences concerned were
offences under the laws of both states. Dual criminality is no longer a
requirement for extradition between EU member states in respect of certain
major offences which are listed in the European Arrest Warrants Act 2003.</p>

<p>They include participation in a criminal organisation, terrorism,
trafficking in human beings, sexual exploitation of children and child
pornography; trafficking in arms, ammunition and explosives; corruption, fraud,
money laundering and counterfeiting of money. European Arrest Warrants issued
in respect of crimes or alleged crimes on this list have to be executed by the
arresting state irrespective of whether or not the definition of the offence is
the same, providing that the offence is serious enough and punishable by at
least 3 years' imprisonment in the member state that has issued the warrant.
The dual criminality requirement remains for all other offences.</p>

<h3>Timeframe for European Arrest Warrants </h3>

<p>A decision on whether or not to extradite someone should normally be taken
within 60 days of their arrest or, if this is not possible, within 90 days.
These are not legally binding limits but are indicative of the time scales
involved. </p>

<h3>Processing times for warrants</h3>

<p>Each member state nominates a central authority for the purposes of the
European Arrest Warrant. In Ireland, this authority is the Department of
Justice and Equality. The High Court is responsible for the execution of
European Arrest Warrants received by Ireland. </p>

<p>The Director of Public Prosecutions may apply Court for the issue of a
European Arrest Warrant where a person in another member state is facing
charges or is required to serve a sentence in Ireland. </p>

<h3>Irish legislation on European Arrest Warrants</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1965/en/act/pub/0017/sec0008.html#zza17y1965s8">Part
II of the Extradition Act 1965</a> provides for extradition between Ireland and
countries other than the UK. This legislation is modelled on the <a shape="rect" href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/024.htm">1957 Council
of Europe Convention on Extradition</a> to which Ireland is a party. Ireland is
also a party to a number of international conventions which provide special
extradition arrangements in relation to specific offences - for example, in the
aviation field. The 1965 Act has been amended on a number of occasions. In
fact, Part III of the 1965 Act dealing with extradition between Ireland and the
UK was repealed by the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1987/en/act/pub/0001/index.html">Extradition
(European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act 1987</a> is based on
the <a shape="rect" href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/090.htm">European
Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism</a>. This legislation restricts the
circumstances in which a person can avoid extradition on the grounds that the
offence in question is a political offence or an offence connected with a
political offence. The underlying principle of the terrorism convention was
that perpetrators of acts of terrorism should not be immune from extradition,
by pleading that the act they had committed was a political offence.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0006/index.html">Extradition
(Amendment) Act 1994</a> extended the range of offences that could not be
regarded as political for extradition purposes.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0049/index.html">Extradition
(European Union Conventions) Act 2001</a> provided for the implementation of
the <a shape="rect" href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_criminal_matters/l14015a_en.htm">1995
and 1996 Conventions on Simplified Extradition Procedure</a> between the member
states of the European Union. The Act also provides that all extradition
proceedings are to be heard in the High Court.</p>

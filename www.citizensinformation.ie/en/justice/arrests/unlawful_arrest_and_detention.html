<p>In order to arrest you, the Garda Siochana must have a warrant for your <a shape="rect" href="arrests.html">arrest</a> unless you are arrested for an
offence that is punishable by imprisonment for a term of 5 years or more. In
that case, the Gardai must have reasonable cause to suspect that you are guilty
of an offence. </p>

<p>Once you are arrested, you must be brought to a Garda station without undue
delay and informed that you have a right to consult a solicitor. See our
document on <a href="treatment_in_custody.html">treatment in custody</a>.
</p>

<p>You must be told the reason for your arrest. The Garda√≠ do not have to
inform you in any particular form the reason and legal basis for your arrest.
However, you do have to be informed in an understandable way why you are being
arrested. For example, if you are arrested for drink driving the Garda is not
obliged to cite the specific provision ("I am arresting you under the
provisions of Section 49 (8) of the Road Traffic Act, 1961"). The courts have
recognised flexibility with respect to citation of specific provisions so long
as the gist of the provision was explained to the accused by the Garda ("I am
arresting you for drink driving"). </p>

<p>Your arrest is unlawful if the Garda fails to inform you in ordinary
language the reason for your arrest or fails to cite the relevant law. If this
happens the detention which follows is unlawful. If your arrest is just a sham
or a cover so that you can be questioned in relation to other offences, then
that arrest is unlawful. However, if the reasons for your arrest are given to
you at any time during your detention, your custody becomes lawful from that
point on. </p>

<p>When you are arrested, you have a right to be brought before a court at the
first possible opportunity. Different legislation specifies <a href="detention_after_arrest.html">how long you may be held in detention</a>
for questioning. In most cases where you have been arrested for an offence
punishable by 5 years imprisonment or more, the maximum period of detention is
24 hours. </p>

<p>While you are in detention, you have a constitutional right of reasonable
access to a solicitor and you have a right to be told that you have a right to
consult a solicitor. If you ask for a solicitor you cannot be questioned until
they arrive, except in exceptional circumstances. You have a right to have your
solicitor in the room with you while you are being interviewed.. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you have been unlawfully arrested, evidence obtained as a result of that
arrest will be inadmissible. For example, if you were mistakenly told by a
Garda that you were being arrested under the wrong section of the Road Traffic
Act, the arrest and the blood sample taken would be unlawful. The blood sample
would not be admissible as evidence. </p>

<p>Evidence obtained while you are unlawfully detained has also been unlawfully
obtained and will be inadmissible. For example, if you have been in custody for
longer than the maximum period allowed and you make a confession, that
confession will not be admissible in evidence against you. </p>

<p>Evidence obtained in breach of your right to reasonable access to a lawyer
is also inadmissible as evidence against you. For example, if you request a
lawyer and your request is refused, any statements you make to the police will
be inadmissible as evidence against you. </p>

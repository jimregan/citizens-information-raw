<p>The <a href="right_to_silence_in_criminal_cases.html">right to
silence</a> and the right not to incriminate oneself are generally recognised
international standards in law. Article 38.1 of Bunreacht na hEireann (the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/irish_constitution_1/">Constitution
of Ireland</a>) and Article 6 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European
Convention on Human Rights</a> both protect citizens against being forced to
make statements which result in admissions of guilt. The following words must
be spoken by the Gardaí before they are allowed to take a statement from a
suspect:</p>

<p>“You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but
anything you say will be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence.”
</p>

<p dir="ltr">These words are known as the <em>caution</em>. It means that you
must be informed that there is no legal obligation on you to say anything or to
make a statement.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Are there rules covering the taking of statements?</h3>

<p>Yes. The rules that cover the taking of statements from suspects are called
the <em>Judges’ Rules</em>. Originally drawn up in 1912, they are a guide for
the Gardaí when investigating a crime, to ensure that suspects are treated
fairly. The Judges' Rules do not have the force of law, however, any statement
taken from a suspect, in a way which breaks these rules, is likely to be
rejected by a judge conducting a criminal trial. </p>

<p>A very important difference between a statement being made involuntarily and
a statement taken in breach of the Judges’ Rules is that, while an
involuntary statement must be excluded in a trial, the statement taken in
contravention of the Judges’ Rules <em>can </em>be allowed by the judge (if
he/she decides). In other words, the judge has discretion to include or exclude
statements in this regard. </p>

<p>While there are nine rules, the main purpose of them is to ensure that any
suspect who is going to make a statement to the Gardaí must be informed of
their right to silence by way of the caution. </p>

<p>If you make a statement to the Gardaí and the caution is given to you by
the Gardaí before the statement is taken, then the contents of the statement
can be used in any court case or trial that results. Often, a statement by a
suspect is a confession admitting his/her part in a crime. If you make a
confession in a statement, then the courts look very closely at the
circumstances which surrounded the taking of the statement of confession. </p>

<p dir="ltr">The most important issue that surrounds a written confession (or
statement) is the voluntariness of the confession. Confessions (whether oral or
in writing), made by a suspect before a trial or court case can only be proved
against the suspect if they were free and voluntary. To be free and voluntary a
confession must not be influenced by hope or fear, in the form of a threat,
promise or inducement. Any such statement of confession by a suspect will be
held to be an involuntary confession. </p>

<h3>How will the court know if a statement is involuntary? </h3>

<p>Broadly speaking, anything that suggests to you that your position in
relation to the crime would be <strong>better </strong>if you made a statement
of confession (or <strong>worse </strong>if you did not), renders such a
statement inadmissible, because it was involuntary. </p>

<p>Over the years, the courts have taken a very strict line on anything that
could constitute an inducement, threat or promise. In the case of <em>The
People-v-Murphy [1947] I.R.236</em> the expression “you are all right”,
used by a member of the Gardaí to a suspect before taking a statement from
him, was found by the court to mean “you will be all right”, which the
court said amounted to an improper inducement. </p>

1984 (Electronic Recording of Interviews) Regulations 1997</a> (as amended)
provides for the electronic recording of certain interviews in Garda stations.
If you are detained in a Garda station after arrest under the provisions of:</p>

</ul><p>your interview with the Gardaí must be electronically recorded. You can
read <a shape="rect" href="detention_after_arrest.html">more about about
detention after arrest here</a>. </p>

<p>For the courts and the suspect, it provides them with proof as to whether or
not statements were made voluntarily. It has also almost eliminated the
practice of suspects making complaints and allegations of Garda abuse and
allegation that they were forced into making involuntary statements. </p>

<h3>What is the procedure for taking statements from suspects?</h3>

<p>If you decide to make a statement, the Gardaí have to issue the caution
informing you of your right to remain silent. This caution must be included at
the top line of the written statement. The contents of the statement are then
written down, either by you or by the Gardaí. Normally this is done by the
Gardaí, but you are allowed to write the statement if you wish. </p>

<p>In the process of taking down your statement, the Gardaí cannot cross
examine you. They are allowed to ask you questions in order to clarify anything
you say which is unclear. When you are finished giving your statement the
Gardaí either read out the statement to you, or invite you to read the
statement yourself. </p>

<p>The Gardaí then invite you to make any alterations or additions to the
statement if you wish to do so. This fact is recorded at the end of the
statement in the following way. </p>

<blockquote dir="ltr">
  <p>“This statement has been read over to (or by) me, and I have been
  invited to make any corrections thought necessary in it. </p>

  <p>It is correct”. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, the Gardaí ask you to sign the statement. The signature should be
written on the next available line and should be witnessed by those present. In
the case of a juvenile, the signature should also be witnessed by a parent,
adult relative or guardian. </p>

<p>If you refuse to sign the statement the Gardaí insert the words “Declined
to sign” and the reasons for refusing are also included. In the case of an
illiterate suspect (that is, someone who cannot read or write), he/she is asked
to make a mark in place of a signature. </p>

<h3>Can a suspect get a copy of the statement?</h3>

<p>If you make a statement to the Gardaí you are entitled to a copy of the
statement free of charge. If you engage a solicitor after making your
statement, then your solicitor is entitled to a copy of the statement free of
charge. </p>

<p>If you make a statement to the Gardaí and it is electronically recorded
then you or your solicitor is entitled to a copy of the electronic recording.
There is no fee for this tape. </p>

<p>If another person has been charged with the same offence and his/her
statement has been taken separately, the Gardaí should not read this statement
to you. You should however, be given a copy of the statement and the Gardaí
should say nothing that would invite a reply. </p>

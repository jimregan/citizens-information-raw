<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../courts_system/high_court.html">High Court</a>, the
person who is bringing the case, that is, the person who is suing, is known as
the <em>plaintiff</em>. The person who is being sued is known as the
<em>defendant</em>.</p>

<p>To commence proceedings, that is, to start a legal action, the plaintiff's
<a href="../courtroom/barristers.html">barrister</a> prepares an
<em>originating summons</em>. The purpose of this document is to state the case
being made against the defendant.</p>

<p>When the defendant receives the summons, they must <em>enter an
appearance</em> to show that they are now a party to the case.</p>

<p>Depending on the type of originating summons, the plaintiff may have to
serve a <em>statement of claim</em> on the defendant. When the defendant has
received the statement of claim, they will issue a <em>defence</em>, setting
out why the defendant is not to blame.</p>

<p>If the defendant believes that they actually have a claim against the
plaintiff, the defendant will include a <em>counterclaim</em> with the defence
setting out their claim against the plaintiff.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lfac39">Originating summons</h2>

<p>Usually proceedings in the High Court are commenced by an originating
summons.</p>

<p>After the summons has been prepared by your barrister, your <a href="representation_in_court.html">solicitor</a> takes it to the <a href="../court_offices/high_court_office.html">Central Office</a> to be
<em>issued</em> - this involves paying the stamp duty. After the stamp duty has
been paid, the summons is stamped and it is ready to be served on the
defendant. There is more information in <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/8652fb610b0b37a980256db700399507/075bc801b92703e180256d2b0046b3f9?OpenDocument">Order
5 of the Rules of the Superior Courts</a>.</p>

<h3>Types of originating summons</h3>

<p>There are 3 types of originating summons:</p>
<ul><li>A <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/2b513051ef3462c980256db700399501/87fa49fe11fa0cd180256f23006202d8?OpenDocument#IForm1">plenary
    summons</a> is used to commence proceedings where there is a real dispute
    between the parties and/or the amount of the plaintiff's claim is not
    specific or easy to calculate. For example, a plenary summons may be used
    where the plaintiff claims that they were injured in a road traffic
    accident due to the defendant's negligence. When a plenary summons is
    issued, the next step is for the parties to exchange pleadings (see
    statement of claim and delivering the defence below). Eventually, the case
    will be given a date for a trial and there may be evidence given by
    witnesses.</li>
  <li>A <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/2b513051ef3462c980256db700399501/87fa49fe11fa0cd180256f23006202d8?OpenDocument#IForm2">summary
    summons</a> is used when the amount of the plaintiff's claim is easily
    quantifiable and the defendant does not have any valid defence. For
    example, a summary summons may be used where the plaintiff claims that they
    lent the defendant a specific amount of money that has not been repaid.
    <em>Summary proceedings</em> do not involve pleadings and do not end in a
    trial with evidence given by witnesses. It is a fast-track procedure where
    the judge decides the case after reading <a href="../witnesses/affidavit.html">affidavits</a> submitted by both
    sides. However, if it becomes clear to the judge that the defendant has a
    stateable defence to the claim, the judge may order that the case be dealt
    with as <em>plenary proceedings</em>. This means that pleadings will be
    exchanged and the matter may go to trial.</li>
  <li>A <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/2b513051ef3462c980256db700399501/87fa49fe11fa0cd180256f23006202d8?OpenDocument#IForm3">special
    summons</a> is used for cases that involve pure issues of law or very
    specific issues of fact. For example, a special summons will be issued to
    commence a claim relating to the <a href="../../death/the_deceaseds_estate/dealing_with_the_deceaseds_estate.html">administration
    of the estate of a deceased person</a>. Like summary proceedings, this is a
    fast-track procedure where the judge decides the case by reading affidavits
    submitted by both sides.</li>
</ul><p>There is <a href="http://www.courts.ie/courts.ie/library3.nsf/pagecurrent/77EEE46A31FAF1CB8025804B005AB888?opendocument&amp;l=en">more
information on originating summons</a> on the Courts Service website.</p>

<h3>Content of an originating summons</h3>

<p>All originating summonses must contain the following information:</p>
<ul><li>A title – the plaintiff's name and the defendant's name make up the
    title of the proceedings.</li>
  <li>The type of the summons, for example, plenary summons.</li>
  <li>A description of the parties – the summons must state the surname,
    first name, the residence or place of business and the occupation of the
    plaintiff. It must also state the name and address of the defendant (or
    their solicitor).</li>
  <li>An <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/8652fb610b0b37a980256db700399507/6cc828ffe0033d1180256d2b0046b3d2?OpenDocument">indorsement
    of claim</a> – this is the part of the summons that sets out what the
    plaintiff claims they are entitled to. The level of detail necessary in
    this section depends on the type of summons. If the summons is a plenary
    summons, it is only necessary to give the defendant information about the
    general nature of the plaintiff's claim – more detail will be provided in
    the statement of claim that follows. If the summons is a summary summons or
    a special summons, much more detail must be given about the nature, extent
    and grounds of the plaintiff's claim against the defendant. It should
    clearly set out the allegations that are being made by the plaintiff and
    the amount that the plaintiff claims they are entitled to.</li>
</ul><h3>Serving an originating summons</h3>

<p>To serve an originating summons, a copy of the summons must be handed to the
defendant and they must be shown the original. The summons can be served on the
defendant's solicitor if they accept service on behalf of their client and is
authorised to do so. There is more information on serving a summons in <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/8652fb610b0b37a980256db700399507/e0b5fdf14c8d3ac980256d2b0046b3d1?OpenDocument">Order
9 of the Rules of the Superior Courts</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l31dbb">Entering an appearance</h2>

<p>When a defendant receives a plenary or a summary summons they should enter
an appearance within 8 days. This time limit is not strict and in most cases,
an appearance can be entered after the time has expired.</p>

<p>When a defendant receives a special summons they may enter an appearance at
any time. They will not be heard at any proceedings unless they have entered an
appearance.</p>

<p>Entering an appearance is a very important step as it indicates that the
defendant intends to defend the proceedings.</p>

<p>To enter an appearance, the defendant must lodge a <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/2b513051ef3462c980256db700399501/87fa49fe11fa0cd180256f23006202d8?OpenDocument#IIForm1">memorandum
of appearance</a> at the Central Office. The plaintiff's solicitor must then be
notified by the defendant that an appearance has been entered.</p>

<p>Memorandum of appearance</p>

<p>The short form must contain the following information:</p>
<ul><li>The date</li>
  <li>The name of the defendant's solicitor. If the defendant does not have a
    solicitor, it must state that the defendant defends in person.</li>
  <li>The form must also give the solicitor's address. If the defendant does
    not have a solicitor, it must state an address where documents can be left
    for them.</li>
</ul><p>Further information on entering an appearance is available in <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/8652fb610b0b37a980256db700399507/7978f54a6c83cee680256d2b0046b3b1?OpenDocument">Order

</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l9399b">Statement of claim</h2>

<p>If the case has been commenced by a plenary summons and the defendant has
entered an appearance, then the next step is for the plaintiff to serve a <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/2b513051ef3462c980256db700399501/08948ddc9327524780256f2300629296?OpenDocument#PartIV">statement
of claim</a> on the defendant.</p>

<p>The plaintiff has 21 days to deliver the statement of claim after the
defendant has entered an appearance. If the plaintiff fails to deliver the
statement of claim within the required time, the defendant can apply to the
court to dismiss the action for want of prosecution.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to serve the statement of claim personally on the
defendant – it may be sent by registered post.</p>

<p>The purpose of the statement of claim is to show the defendant the case that
is being made against them and which they have to meet at the trial of the
action.</p>

<h3>Content of statement of claim</h3>

<p>The statement of claim must contain the following information:</p>
<ul><li>The title and record number – the plaintiff's name and the defendant's
    name make up the title of the proceedings.</li>
  <li>A description of the parties – the statement of claim must state the
    surname, first name, the residence or place of business and the occupation
    of the plaintiff and the defendant.</li>
  <li>The statement of claim must state the nature, extent and grounds of the
    plaintiff's claim against the defendant. It should clearly set out the
    allegations that are being made by the plaintiff and the damage that the
    plaintiff suffered. It should also state what the plaintiff is seeking from
    the court.</li>
  <li>The statement of claim must be dated and signed by the plaintiff or their
    solicitor.</li>
</ul><p>Further information is available in <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/8652fb610b0b37a980256db700399507/1740e8e45d8aa88380256d2b0046b3a6?OpenDocument">Order

<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l1554b">Delivering the defence</h2>

<p>The defendant must deliver a <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/2b513051ef3462c980256db700399501/08948ddc9327524780256f2300629296?OpenDocument#PartV">defence</a>
to the plaintiff and they must deliver the defence within 28 days of receiving
the statement of claim. This time limit is not strict and in most cases, a
defence can be delivered after the time has expired.</p>

<p>When they receive the statement of claim they may decide that not only have
they done nothing wrong and the claim should not have been brought against
them, but that they have a claim against the plaintiff. In those circumstances,
they may wish to include a <em>counterclaim</em> with their defence.</p>

<h3>The defence contents</h3>

<p>There are no set rules about what must be contained in the defence. The
document starts with the title of the proceedings and the record number.</p>

<p>It is up to the defendant to admit or deny the allegations that the
plaintiff has made in their statement of claim. It is also up to the defendant
to state any specific defence that they are relying on. For example, if the
defendant is claiming that the plaintiff's claim has been brought outside of
the <a href="taking_a_civil_case_intro.html">time limits</a>, then the
defendant should specifically plead that fact in the defence.</p>

<p>If the plaintiff has made a specific allegation and the defendant fails to
deny that allegation in the defence, it will be assumed that the defendant is
admitting that the allegation is true. For example, if the plaintiff has
claimed in the statement of claim that they were involved in a road traffic
accident and the defence fails to deny that the road traffic accident occurred,
then it is assumed that the defendant is admitting that the road traffic
accident happened. It is not then necessary for the plaintiff to prove to the
judge that the accident occurred.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when the defendant specifically denies a claim that the
plaintiff has made, they are putting the plaintiff <em>on proof</em> of the
allegation. This means that the plaintiff must prove that the claim is true.
For example, if the defence specifically denies that the road traffic accident
occurred, the plaintiff must prove it by introducing evidence in court.</p>

<h3>Counterclaim</h3>

<p>If the defendant wishes to make a claim against the plaintiff, this can be
done by adding a counterclaim section to the defence. This must clearly set out
the allegations that the defendant is making against the plaintiff and what the
defendant seeks from the court.</p>

<p>There is more information in <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/8652fb610b0b37a980256db700399507/e778fe8da93c259480256d2b0046b3b4?OpenDocument">Order

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la2bba">Delivering a reply</h2>

<p>It is often necessary to reply to points raised in a defence. If the
plaintiff wishes to deliver a <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/2b513051ef3462c980256db700399501/08948ddc9327524780256f2300629296?OpenDocument#PartVI">reply</a>,
they must do so within 14 days of receiving the defence unless the time is
extended by the Court.</p>

<p>Where a counterclaim has been delivered by the defence, the reply is subject
to the rules that apply to a defence.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="le2575">Judgement in default</h2>

<p>If the defendant fails to enter an appearance, the plaintiff can apply to
court for <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/8652fb610b0b37a980256db700399507/1d1c0777e1b70de080256d2b0046b3f5?OpenDocument">judgement

to acknowledge the proceedings and indicate that they intend to defend them,
the plaintiff may obtain a judgement from the court against the defendant
without the need for a trial.</p>

<p>If the defendant fails to deliver a defence, the plaintiff can apply to
Court for <em>judgement in default of defence</em>. This means that because the
defendant has failed to send a defence to the plaintiff, the plaintiff may
obtain a judgement from the court against the defendant without the need for a
trial. There is more information in <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/8652fb610b0b37a980256db700399507/87666f02d0947eb780256d2b0046b3ef?OpenDocument">Order

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="ld1a06">Particulars</h2>

<p>Where either plaintiff or defendant is unsure of the case they have to meet,
they can seek <em>particulars</em>. It is a request for more information about
the case. They can also seek <em>further and better particulars</em> about any
matter stated in any pleading.</p>

<p>They can apply for the particulars by letter or seek an order from the
Court.</p>

<p>In general, in actions commenced by plenary summons a <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/2b513051ef3462c980256db700399501/e8e19d627147aba880256f230063923a?OpenDocument">notice
of trial (Form 18 or 19)</a> is served by the plaintiff on the defendant and is
set down for trial in the Central Office. At least 21 days’ notice must be
given, unless shorter notice has been agreed. A motion to set aside the notice
of trial must be brought within 4 days of the service of the notice.</p>

<p>If the plaintiff does not give notice of trial within 6 weeks after the
close of the pleadings, or within such extended time as the Court may allow,
the defendant may give notice of trial or may apply to the Court to dismiss the
action for want of prosecution.</p>

<p>Notice of trial is given before setting down the action for trial. If the
action is not set down by either party within 14 days of notice of trial being
served, the notice of trial will no longer be in force.</p>

<p>The party setting down the proceedings for trial does so by delivering to
the Central Office a copy of the notice of trial together with 2 copies of the
whole of the pleadings (and of any letter or notice for particulars and reply
to it), one of which is for the use of the judge at the trial.</p>

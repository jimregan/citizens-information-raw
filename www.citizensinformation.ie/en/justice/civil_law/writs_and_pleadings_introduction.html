<p>Pleadings (sometimes called <em>writs</em>) are court documents that are
exchanged by the parties in a case. If the case is a <a href="../courts_system/high_court.html">High Court</a> or <a href="../courts_system/circuit_court.html">Circuit Court</a> case, the <a href="../courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a> will usually appoint a <a href="../courtroom/barristers.html">barrister</a> to draft the pleadings in
the case.</p>

<p>The person who is bringing the case, that is, the person who is suing, is
known as the <em>plaintiff</em> or <em>claimant</em>. The person who is being
sued is known as the <em>defendant</em> or <em>respondent</em>.</p>

<p>If you receive a writ or pleading that was sent to you in error, you should
contact the solicitor whose name appears on the document.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>District Court cases</h3>

<p>If the claimant wishes to <em>commence proceedings</em> (that is, to start
the legal action) in the District Court, their solicitor prepares and serves a
<em>claim notice</em> on the respondent.</p>

<p>The respondent (or their solicitor) then gives or sends to the claimant (or
their solicitor) an <em>appearance and defence</em> to show that they intend to
defend the case.</p>

<p>If the respondent believes that they actually have a claim against the
claimant, the respondent includes in the appearance and defence a <em>statement
of counterclaim</em> setting out their claim against the claimant.</p>

<p>There is more information in our document on <a href="civil_summons_in_ireland.html">District Court procedures</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Circuit Court and High Court cases</h3>

<p>To commence proceedings the plaintiff's barrister prepares a <em>Civil
Bill</em> if the case is a Circuit Court case or an <em>originating
summons</em> if the case is a High Court case.</p>

<p>The purpose of these documents is to state the case being made against the
defendant. For example, if the case is about a road traffic accident, the writ
should clearly set out the circumstances of the accident and why and how the
defendant is at fault. The document also sets out in detail the injuries that
the plaintiff suffered.</p>

<p>When the defendant receives the Civil Bill or originating summons, they must
<em>enter an appearance</em> to show that they are now a party to the case and
intend to defend it. </p>

<p>If it is a High Court case, the plaintiff may then have to send a
<em>statement of claim</em> to the defendant.</p>

<p>The defendant may send the plaintiff a <em>Notice for Particulars</em>
requesting further details and more information.</p>

<p>When the defendant has received <em>Replies to Particulars</em>, they issue
their <em>Defence</em>, setting out why the defendant is not to blame. If the
defendant believes that they actually have a claim against the plaintiff, the
defendant includes a <em>counterclaim</em> with the Defence setting out their
claim against the plaintiff.</p>

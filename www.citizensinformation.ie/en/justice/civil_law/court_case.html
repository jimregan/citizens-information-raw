<p>If your civil court case has not been settled '<span>out-of-court</span>',
it will be set down for trial before a court.</p>

<h3>Liability in issue</h3>

<p>If the defendant in the case has not admitted he/she is at fault, the trial
will take the following format;</p>
<ul><li>Your <a shape="rect" href="../courtroom/barristers.html">barrister</a>
    will outline to the <a shape="rect" href="../courtroom/judge.html">judge</a> the nature of the case and the
    injuries you suffered.</li>
  <li>Medical evidence relating to your injuries may be given by a doctor if
    appropriate to your case.</li>
  <li>An engineer may be called to give evidence if necessary.</li>
  <li>You are called to give evidence: <br>
    - This will involve swearing on oath and answering the questions posed to
    you by your barrister as clearly and concisely as possible. You will give
    evidence relating to how the accident occurred and your injuries. <br>
    - When your barrister has finished asking you questions, you will be
    cross-examined by the barrister on the other side. The object of
    cross-examination is to discover the truth so you may be asked questions
    about inconsistencies in your evidence. You may also be told what the
    defendant or his/her witnesses say is the true version of events and asked
    to comment on their evidence. </li>
  <li>All the other <a href="../witnesses/witnesses_introduction.html">witnesses</a> on your
    side give <a shape="rect" href="../evidence/evidence_introduction.html">evidence</a> and are
    cross-examined.</li>
  <li>The defendant's witnesses are each called to the witness box and give
    evidence. Your barrister may cross-examine each one of them.</li>
  <li>When all the witnesses have been called, both barristers may make
    submissions to the judge. This may include summarising or emphasising
    certain evidence or making legal arguments.</li>
  <li>The judge will make his/her decision on:<br>
    - Whether the defendant is at fault and therefore liable to pay damages
    to you,<br>
    - The amount of damages to which you are entitled as a result of your
    injuries and<br>
    - Who shall pay the costs of the proceedings.</li>
</ul><p>Usually, if you have won the case, the judge will order that the
    defendant pay your legal costs as well as his/her own. If you lose, it is
    likely you will have to pay the costs of both sides.</p>
    

<h3>Assessments only</h3>

<p>If the defendant admits that he/she is to blame for your injuries and you
are not happy with the amount offered in settlement of damages, then the matter
will be sent to a court for judgement on the amount of damages you are entitled
to.</p>

<p>In this situation, the court does not consider the question of who is to
blame. The judge will merely place a value on your case based on an examination
of the nature and extent of your injuries and the prognosis for the future.
This examination will be conducted by considering the available medical reports
and/or hearing medical practitioners' evidence relating to your injuries. </p>

<p>You will be called as a witness so that you can describe your injuries.</p>

<h3>When will you receive the award?</h3>

<p>Usually awards as a result of civil cases are paid by the defendant to your
solicitor within 6 to 8 weeks.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a>,
the person who is bringing the case, that is, the person who is suing, is known
as the <em>claimant</em>. The person who is being sued is known as the
<em>respondent</em>.</p>

<p>To commence proceedings, that is, to start a legal action, the claimant’s
<a href="representation_in_court.html">solicitor</a> prepares and serves a
<em>claim notice</em> on the respondent. The respondent’s solicitor responds
with an <em>appearance and defence</em> to show that they intend to defend the
case.</p>

<p>They may also include in the appearance and defence a <em>statement of
counterclaim</em> if they believe they have a claim against the claimant.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l62caf">Claim notice</h2>

<p>A claim notice is issued to commence proceedings in the District Court.
Usually a claim notice is prepared by the claimant's solicitor. The claim
notice must then be filed for issuing and the stamp duty paid at the <a href="../court_offices/district_court_office.html">District Court
office</a>.</p>

<h3>Notice content</h3>

<p>The claim notice must contain the following information:</p>
<ul><li>A description of the parties. The notice must state the full name,
    address, occupation, solicitor’s details and address for service of
    documents for the claimant and for the respondent (where possible).</li>
  <li>A statement of the claim set out in numbered paragraphs. The notice must
    clearly and concisely set out the allegations that are being made by the
    claimant and the amount or other remedy being sought. It must contain a
    list of all correspondence and other documents on which the claim relies.
    It should clearly indicate to the respondent that they have a case to
    answer.</li>
  <li>The notice must recite the appropriate <a href="../courts_system/district_court.html">District Court area</a> in
    which the claim is being brought.</li>
  <li>The notice must set out that, if the respondent wishes to admit the
    claim, they should contact the claimant within 10 days of service of the
    notice to agree payment of the claim and costs. The proceedings will not
    then be continued.</li>
  <li>The notice must explain what steps the respondent must take if they wish
    to dispute the claim.</li>
  <li>The notice must be signed by the claimant or their solicitor.</li>
</ul><p>You can find a copy of a <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/53bd32841fc5bbf280256d2b0045bb5d/d858b7614d245afc80257c90005e90d5?OpenDocument">claim
notice for general damages</a> on the Courts Service website.</p>

<h3>Serving the notice</h3>

<p>The District Court clerk will issue the claim notice to the solicitor for
service on the respondent. There are 2 ways to serve the claim notice:</p>
<ul><li>By personal service</li>
  <li>By registered prepaid post</li>
</ul><p>A copy of the notice may be given to the respondent personally or to the
respondent’s spouse, civil partner, child, employee or agent at the
respondent’s last known residence or workplace, as long as that person is not
under 16 years of age.</p>

<p>A copy of the notice may be sent by registered prepaid post to the
respondent's last known residence or place of business.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l12834">Defence</h2>

<p>When a respondent receives a claim notice they must choose whether or not to
defend the case.</p>

<p>If you are the respondent and you wish to admit that you were wrong and
prevent the case from going to court, you must contact the claimant or the
claimant’s solicitor within 10 days of receiving the claim notice to agree
payment of the claim and costs.</p>

<p>If you believe that the claimant is not entitled to the damages being sought
from you and you wish to defend the case in court, you must:</p>
<ul><li>Serve an appearance and defence on the claimant or the claimant’s
    solicitor and</li>
  <li>File a copy of the appearance with the District Court clerk</li>
</ul><h3>Appearance and defence content</h3>

<p>The appearance and defence states:</p>
<ul><li>The District Court area</li>
  <li>The names of the claimant and respondent</li>
  <li>The respondent’s details</li>
  <li>That the respondent "intends to defend this claim notice"</li>
  <li>A statement of the grounds of defence, set out in numbered paragraphs</li>
</ul><p>The grounds of defence must state which of the facts in the claimant’s
statement of claim are admitted, not admitted or denied and the reasons for
denying the fact. It must contain a list of all correspondence and other
documents on which the respondent will rely on in a trial. If a counterclaim is
being made, a <em>notice and statement of counterclaim</em> must also be
included.</p>

<p>The appearance and defence must be dated and signed by the respondent or
their solicitor.</p>

<p>You can find a copy of an <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/53bd32841fc5bbf280256d2b0045bb5d/c829e42ef6a5e6a680257c90006150b8?OpenDocument">appearance
and defence (general)</a> on the Courts Service website.</p>

<h3>Serving the appearance and defence</h3>

<p>The appearance and defence must be sent to the claimant within 28 days of
receiving the claim notice. If you do not send it in time, then the claimant
can apply to the court for <em>judgement in default</em>. This means that
because you have not shown your intention to defend the case, you are taken to
have admitted the claim against you. There will be no hearing – the court may
simply make an order for judgement against you.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l5ec2d">Counterclaim</h2>

<p>When you receive a claim notice, you may decide that not only have you done
nothing wrong and the claim should not have been brought against you, but the
claimant has actually caused you damage. In those circumstances, you may wish
to bring a claim against the claimant for damages.</p>

<p>To make a claim against the claimant (called a <em>counterclaim</em>) you
must include a <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/53bd32841fc5bbf280256d2b0045bb5d/8b9061fe00aa453280257c9100442dff?OpenDocument">notice
and statement of counterclaim</a> in the appearance and defence which must be
filed with the District Court clerk and served on the claimant.</p>

<h3>Content of counterclaim</h3>

<p>The notice of counterclaim must state that the respondent counterclaims
against the claimant.</p>

<p>The statement of counterclaim must be set out in numbered paragraphs. It
must clearly and concisely set out the allegations that are being made by the
respondent and the amount or other remedy being sought. It must contain a list
of all correspondence and other documents on which the counterclaim relies.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l99efa">Further particulars</h2>

<p>At any time before or when serving an appearance and defence, the respondent

days’ notice of trial must be given. The notice must be filed with the

    affidavits in the case, in chronological sequence</li>

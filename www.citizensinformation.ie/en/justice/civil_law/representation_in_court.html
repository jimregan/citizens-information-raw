<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>If you are involved in litigation or legal proceedings, you will probably
need legal representation. This is provided by a solicitor and, possibly, a
barrister.</p>

<h3>Solicitors</h3>

<p>As well as representing persons involved in litigation, solicitors provide
services that are not connected with court proceedings. For example, a
solicitor may assist you in the preparation and formalisation of your will or
with the legal transfer of your property (conveyancing).</p>

<p>Solicitors can advertise their services. They deal with the public, take
instructions from clients, do the necessary background work on cases, give
preliminary advice, obtain expert or specialist opinion if necessary and
instruct barristers if required.</p>

<p>The solicitor prepares the case for the trial. they may represent you in
court but will usually instruct a barrister to represent you in the higher
courts. This is done by sending the barrister a brief containing all the
relevant information and documentation to assist them in the presentation of
the case.</p>

<p>There is more information in our <a href="../courtroom/solicitors.html">document on solicitors</a>.</p>

<h3>Barristers</h3>

<p>Barristers, also known as Counsel, operate from the Law Library. They cannot
advertise or solicit clients and do not generally have direct access to the
public. They take their instructions from solicitors.</p>

<p>They provide legal advice of a specialist nature and generally represent the
client in court.</p>

<p>There is a distinction between Junior and Senior Counsel. Most junior
barristers consider taking silk, that is, becoming a Senior Counsel, after
about 15 years practice. Senior Counsel are barristers with greater experience
or expertise. They tend to do less drafting of court documents and spend more
time giving advice and conducting cases in the higher courts.</p>

<p>There is further information in our <a href="../courtroom/barristers.html">document on barristers</a>.</p>

<h3>Information a solicitor needs</h3>

<p>You need to be well-prepared before you start to instruct a solicitor to
make sure you get the best outcome. For example, if you have been involved in
an accident that caused personal injury, the solicitor will need to know:</p>
<ul><li>All the facts surrounding the accident</li>
  <li>All of the injuries you suffered as a result of the accident</li>
  <li>All of the expenses which the accident caused you to incur</li>
</ul><h4>Factual information</h4>

<p>If it was an accident in the workplace, you will need to explain what you
were doing at the time of the accident, who was in charge and who witnessed the
accident.</p>

<p>If the accident was a road traffic accident, you will need to clearly
describe where you were coming from or going to, what the weather conditions
were like, what was the sequence of events leading up to the accident, whether
you were wearing a seat-belt at the time of the accident, what markings and
signs were on the road, who was the investigating Garda and what were the names
and addresses of any witnesses.</p>

<h4>Personal injury details</h4>

<p>When describing your injuries, start with your sensations and feelings at
the time of and immediately after the accident. Then explain whether, when and
how you went to hospital.</p>

<p>Describe all injuries that you suffered, whether they were physical,
psychological or emotional, and all the symptoms including sleep-loss,
nightmares. List all of the doctors, hospitals, physiotherapists and
counsellors (if any) that you attended after the accident. If you already had
injuries before the accident, you must also tell your solicitor about these.
Describe all of the treatments and medications you received as a result of the
accident and any prognosis that has been made.</p>

<h4>Expenses</h4>

<p>Calculate any loss of earnings because you could not go to work and medical
expenses like medication costs and doctors' bills. You should also include
related expenses such as bus and taxi-fares if you are unable to drive as a
result of the accident.</p>

<h4>Other types of claim</h4>

<p>Other types of claims require similar attention to detail in describing what
exactly happened. In a defamation case, it will be necessary to relate how your
reputation or good name has suffered. In a land case, a detailed description of
the history of the land in question and how the dispute arose will be
necessary.</p>

<h3>How to contact a solicitor</h3>

<p>People normally choose a particular solicitor because of a personal
recommendation, because the solicitor's office is in their area or because they
saw an advertisement.</p>

<p>It is usual to first telephone for an appointment with a solicitor. In some
family situations, it may be necessary to consider separate legal
representation for each spouse or partner.</p>

<p>The Law Society is the educational, representative and regulatory body of
the solicitors' profession in Ireland. The Society also deals with <a href="http://www.lawsociety.ie/Public/Complaints-against-solicitors/">complaints
from the public about members of the profession</a>.</p>

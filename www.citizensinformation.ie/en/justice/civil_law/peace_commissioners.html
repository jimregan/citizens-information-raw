<p>A Peace Commissioner is an honorary appointment made in Ireland by the
Minister for Justice and Equality. The powers and duties of Peace Commissioners
consist primarily of: </p>
<ul><li>Taking statutory declarations </li>
  <li>Witnessing signatures on documents of required by various authorities
  </li>
  <li>Signing certificates and orders under various Acts </li>
</ul><p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1924/en/act/pub/0010/index.html">Courts of
Justice Act 1924</a> gives Peace Commissioners the power to issue summons and
warrants. These powers are less frequently used these days. For example,
applications for search warrants are normally made to the local District Court.
</p>

<h3>Finding a Peace Commissioner</h3>

<p>The Department of Justice and Equality maintains the Roll of Peace
Commissioners, however, it may not be up to date. The Department will usually
provide the name and address of a Peace Commissioner on request. </p>

<p>Your local Garda (police) station may be able to give you the name and
address of a Peace Commissioner. The Garda√≠ use their services in the course
of their duties and should be in a position to supply the name and address of
one who is active in your area. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.garda.ie/Stations/Default.aspx">Contact information for all
Garda stations in Ireland</a> is available here.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>There are no qualifying examinations or educational standards required to be
appointed as a Peace Commissioner but you are required to be a person of good
character. Anyone who has been charged with or convicted of a serious offence
will not be considered for appointment. Most Peace Commissioners are well
established in their local community. Those being considered for appointment as
a Peace Commissioner should be aware that the Minister for Justice reserves the
right to verify with the Gardai that you have never been charged or convicted
of a serious offence. </p>

<p>If you are already serving as a Peace Commissioner and are subsequently
convicted for a serious offence, your appointment as a Peace Commissioner will
cease immediately. </p>

<p>Civil servants are usually only appointed as Peace Commissioners where the
performance of their official duties requires this. </p>

<p>Solicitors and persons employed in their offices and members of the clergy
are, as a matter of practice, not appointed as Peace Commissioners because of
the possibility of a conflict of interest. </p>

<p>It is important to note that appointment as Peace Commissioner is entirely
at the discretion of the Minister for Justice, having regard to the needs in
your area. Your suitability for appointment or your standing in the local
community does not confer any automatic entitlement to be appointed as a Peace
Commissioner.</p>

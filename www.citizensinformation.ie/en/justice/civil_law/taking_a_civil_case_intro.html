<p>Civil cases usually involve private disputes between persons or
organizations, such as, disputes involving accidents or breaches of contract .
Before commencing proceedings in your civil case, a number of matters will
arise such as <a href="representation_in_court.html">instructing a
solicitor</a> and the issue of the <a href="cost_of_the_case.html">cost of
the case</a>.</p>

<p>To commence proceedings, you must issue and serve a written court document
called a <a href="writs_and_pleadings_introduction.html">writ or
pleading</a>.</p>

<p>Many cases do not get to court because they are settled in advance. Our <a href="settlement_of_claims.html">settlement of claims</a> document explains
the issues surrounding settlements and lodgements.</p>

<p>After the <a href="court_case.html">court case</a>, if you are unhappy
with the outcome, you can <a href="appealing.html">appeal the
decision</a>.</p>

<h3>Types of civil claim</h3>

<p>If you are taking a case, there are various types of civil claims that you
may take to court.</p>

<p>Many civil claims are <em>personal injuries</em> claims that are brought as
a result of road traffic accidents, accidents at work and slipping or tripping
and falling in a shop, on a road or a public place. It is important to note
that you cannot pursue a personal injuries action through the courts without
first submitting your claim to the <a href="personal_injuries_assessment_board.html">InjuriesBoard.ie
process</a>.</p>

<p>You may have a claim based on breach of contract or based on a neighbour's
interference with your enjoyment of your property - <em>nuisance</em>
claims.</p>

<p>Another type of case is a claim for damages as a result of
<em>defamation</em>, that is, when a person’s reputation is injured as a
result of the publication by any means, orally or in writing, of untruths about
the person.</p>

<p>You may have a claim in relation to ownership of land or you may require the
court to sort out arrangements in respect of marital breakdown.</p>

<h3>Which court?</h3>

<p>Whether your case is heard in the <a href="../courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a>, the <a href="../courts_system/circuit_court.html">Circuit Court</a> or the <a href="../courts_system/high_court.html">High Court</a> will depend on the
value of your case, that is, how much you claim the defendant should pay
you.</p>

<p>If you have been injured in an accident, the value of your case will be
assessed by your legal representatives by considering doctors' reports about
the nature and extent of your injuries and the prognosis for the future.</p>

<p>The District Court has power to award up to €15,000 in damages. The
Circuit Court has power to award up to €75,000 in damages. The High Court has
unlimited power to award damages.</p>

<p>It is important to note that, if your case is heard in Circuit Court and you
are awarded less than €15,000 in damages or in the High Court and you are
awarded less than €75,000 in damages, you may be penalised in costs.</p>

<p>This means that even though you have won your case, you may be obliged to
pay the extra costs incurred by both sides by having the case heard in the
higher court.</p>

<h3>Time limits for actions</h3>

<p>The time limits for commencing proceedings are legislated for in the <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1957_0006.htm">Statute
of Limitations 1957</a>.</p>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0031/index.html">Civil
Liability &amp; Courts Act 2004</a>, a personal injuries claim must be
commenced within 2 years.</p>

<p>A claim based on nuisance, that is, where a person has interfered with your
enjoyment of your property, must be brought within 3 years of the nuisance.</p>

<p>A claim based on breach of contract must be brought within 6 years of the
breach.</p>

<p>A claim based on defamation must be brought within 1 year of the
publication.</p>

<p>Cases relating to land generally must be brought within 12 years.</p>

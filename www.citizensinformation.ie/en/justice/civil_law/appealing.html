<p>If you are unhappy with the result of your case, you may wish to appeal your
case to a higher court. It will mean going through the entire process all over
again. </p>

<p>If your case was commenced in the District Court, it can be appealed to the
Circuit Court. A case commenced in the Circuit Court may be appealed to the
High Court. A High Court case may be appealed to the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>You may choose to appeal the original judge's decision in its entirety,
i.e., his/her decision on who was to blame and the damages awarded (if they
were awarded), in which case the appeal court may</p>
<ol><li>agree with the decision of the original court and uphold it or</li>
  <li>disagree with the decision of the original court and overturn it or</li>
  <li>increase or decrease the amount of damages awarded</li>
</ol><p>If you are happy with decision made by the original judge in relation to who
was at fault but unhappy with the amount of damages he/she has awarded, you may
appeal the amount of damages awarded only. Then the appeal court may either
increase or decrease the amount of damages awarded by the original judge.</p>

<p>If you lose your appeal, you will have to pay the costs of both sides so any
offers to settle made by the other side should be seriously considered.</p>

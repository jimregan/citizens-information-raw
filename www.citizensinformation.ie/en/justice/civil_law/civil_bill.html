<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../courts_system/circuit_court.html">Circuit Court</a>,
the person who is bringing the case, that is, the person who is suing, is known
as the <em>plaintiff</em>. The person who is being sued is known as the
<em>defendant</em>.</p>

<p>To commence proceedings, that is, to start a legal action, the plaintiff's
<a href="../courtroom/barristers.html">barrister</a> prepares a <em>Civil
Bill</em>. The purpose of this document is to state the case being made against
the defendant.</p>

<p>When the defendant receives the Civil Bill, they must <em>enter an
appearance</em> to show that they are now a party to the case and intend to
defend it. The defendant will then issue a <em>defence</em> setting out why
they are not to blame.</p>

<p>If the defendant believes that they actually have a claim against the
plaintiff, the defendant will include a <em>counterclaim</em> with the defence
setting out their claim against the plaintiff.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="le23b9">Civil Bill </h2>

<p>If you are the plaintiff, you must issue a Civil Bill to commence
proceedings in the Circuit Court. Your <a href="representation_in_court.html">solicitor</a> may prepare the Civil Bill
but usually a barrister is briefed to do so.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/CircuitApps?OpenView&amp;Start=1&amp;Count=30&amp;Expand=2#2">different
types of Civil Bill</a> – your legal representatives will prepare the type of
Civil Bill that is appropriate to the nature of the case that you are bringing.
For example, if the case relates to personal injuries sustained in a road
traffic accident, the appropriate Civil Bill is an <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/0f9632235a96242e80256d2b0045bb5c/3fdac1bb0d424f1b80256f24005d1de4?OpenDocument">Ordinary
Civil Bill</a>. However, if your case relates to removing someone from your
premises, the appropriate Civil Bill is an Ejectment Civil Bill.</p>

<h3>Contents of the Civil Bill</h3>

<p>The Civil Bill must contain the following information:</p>
<ul><li>A title – the plaintiff's name and the defendant's name make up the
    title of the proceedings.</li>
  <li>The Bill should also describe the nature of the Civil Bill, for example
    "Ordinary Civil Bill".</li>
  <li>A description of the parties – the Bill must state the surname, first
    name, the residence or place of business and the occupation of the
    plaintiff and the defendant.</li>
  <li>A statement of the claim – the Bill must state the nature, extent and
    grounds of the plaintiff's claim against the defendant. It should clearly
    set out the allegations that are being made by the plaintiff and the damage
    that the plaintiff suffered. It should also state what the plaintiff is
    seeking from the court.</li>
  <li>The Bill must either state the specific amount to which the plaintiff
    claims they are entitled (which cannot be more than €75,000) or it must
    state that the plaintiff's claim is limited to the jurisdiction of the
    court. The plaintiff cannot seek more than €75,000 from the Circuit
  Court.</li>
  <li>The Bill must recite the appropriate circuit in which the claim is being
    brought.</li>
  <li>The Bill must be dated and signed by the plaintiff or their
  solicitor.</li>
</ul><h3>Serving the Civil Bill</h3>

<p>After the Civil Bill has been prepared by the barrister, your solicitor will
take it to the <a href="../court_offices/circuit_court_office.html">Circuit
Court office</a> to be <em>issued</em> – this involves paying the stamp duty.
After the stamp duty has been paid, the Civil Bill is stamped and it is ready
to be served on the defendant or the defendant’s solicitor.</p>

<p>There are different ways to serve the Civil Bill:</p>
<ul><li>You may hand a copy of the Civil Bill to the defendant personally</li>
  <li>A copy may be given to the defendant's spouse, civil partner, relative or
    employee at the defendant’s residence or workplace, as long as that
    person is not under 16 years of age</li>
  <li>You may send a copy by registered prepaid post to the defendant's last
    known residence or place of business.</li>
</ul><p>The rules applying to the service of Civil Bills are contained in <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/6cc6644045a5c09a80256db700399505/bd27818563a864ff802575a0003353b3?OpenDocument">Order

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l31dbb">Entering an appearance</h2>

<p>When the defendant receives the Civil Bill, they should <em>enter an
appearance</em> within 10 days. Entering an appearance is a very important step
as it is indicates in writing that the defendant intends to defend the
proceedings. The time limit is not strict and, in most cases, an appearance can
be entered after the time has expired.</p>

<p>To enter an appearance, the defendant must lodge an <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/0f9632235a96242e80256d2b0045bb5c/8f76a818e8c4aa5d80256f24005ff038?OpenDocument">Entry
of appearance form</a> at the Circuit Court office. A copy of the form must
also be given to the plaintiff's solicitor.</p>

<h3>Judgement in default</h3>

<p>If the defendant fails to enter an appearance, the plaintiff can apply to
court for <em>judgement in default of appearance</em>. This means that because
the defendant has failed to acknowledge the proceedings and indicate that they
intend to defend them, the plaintiff may obtain a judgement from the court
against the defendant without the need for a trial.</p>

<p>If the defendant does enter an appearance but fails to deliver a defence
(see below), the plaintiff may obtain a judgement in default from the court
against the defendant.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l1554b">Delivering the defence</h2>

<p>The defendant must <em>deliver a defence</em> to the plaintiff within 10
days of entering an appearance. This means the defendant must send a <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/0f9632235a96242e80256d2b0045bb5c/cc966e6d9adc620480256f24006005ac?OpenDocument">notice
called Defence</a> to the plaintiff’s solicitor. The 10-day time limit is not
strict and in most cases, a defence can be delivered after the time has
expired.</p>

<h3>Defence content</h3>

<p>There are no set rules about what must be contained in the Defence notice.
The document starts with the title of the proceedings.</p>

<p>It is up to the defendant to admit or deny the allegations that the
plaintiff has made in their Civil Bill. It is also up to the defendant to state
any specific defence that they are relying on. For example, if the defendant is
claiming that the plaintiff's claim has been brought outside of the <a href="taking_a_civil_case_intro.html">time limits</a>, then the defendant
should specifically plead that fact in the Defence notice.</p>

<p>If the plaintiff has made a specific allegation and the defendant fails to
deny that allegation in the Defence notice, it will be assumed that the
defendant is admitting that the allegation is true. For example, if the Civil
Bill claims that the plaintiff was involved in a road traffic accident and the
defence fails to deny that the road traffic accident occurred, then it is
assumed that the defendant is admitting that the road traffic accident
happened. It is not then necessary for the plaintiff to prove to the judge that
the accident occurred.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when the defendant specifically denies a claim that the
plaintiff has made, they are putting the plaintiff <em>on proof</em> of the
allegation. This means that the plaintiff must prove that the claim is true.
For example, if the defendant specifically denies that the road traffic
accident occurred, the plaintiff must prove it by introducing evidence in
court.</p>

<h3>Counterclaim</h3>

<p>When a defendant receives a Civil Bill, they may decide that not only have
they done nothing wrong and the claim should not have been brought against
them, but that they have a claim against the plaintiff. In those circumstances,
they may wish to include a <em>counterclaim</em> with their defence.</p>

<p>To make a claim against the plaintiff, a section titled Counterclaim is
added to the Defence notice. This must clearly set out the allegations that the
defendant is making against the plaintiff and what the defendant seeks from the
court.</p>

<p>The defendant must lodge the Defence notice with counterclaim at the Circuit
Court office. A copy of the form must also be given to the plaintiff's
solicitor.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l6af57">Notice for particulars</h2>

<p>A defendant, at any time after being served with a Civil Bill and before
delivery of a defence, or a plaintiff, at any time after delivery of a defence
or counterclaim, may apply to the other party by a notice in writing for
<em>particulars</em>. A notice for particulars is simply a formal request for
more information about the case. It contains specific questions or requests.</p>

<p>A request for copies of all or any of the documents upon which the action,
defence or counterclaim is founded is made on a <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/0f9632235a96242e80256d2b0045bb5c/c6c77aaac183352a80256f2400609d8a?OpenDocument">Notice
requiring copies of documents</a>. A request for information is made on a <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/0f9632235a96242e80256d2b0045bb5c/8ac730fce4b6063480256f240060b79a?OpenDocument">Notice
requiring further information</a>. The requested particulars should be
delivered within 7 days of receiving the notice.</p>

<p>For example, in a case involving a road traffic accident, the defendant may
send to the plaintiff a notice containing the following questions:</p>

<p>"Was the plaintiff's seat-belt fastened at the time of the accident?"</p>

<p>"Describe the exact location where the accident occurred with the aid of a
map".</p>

<p>The notice is usually prepared by the solicitor (sometimes with the advice
of a barrister).</p>

<h3>Inadequate particulars</h3>

<p>If, say, the plaintiff refuses to reply to the notice for particulars or
does not give adequate replies, the defendant should write to them identifying
the inadequacies and requesting <em>further and better particulars</em>.</p>

<p>If the plaintiff continues to refuse to provide the requested particulars,
the defendant may apply to court. If the court agrees that the defendant is
entitled to replies to the information requested, the court may order the
plaintiff to reply to the notice for particulars.</p>

<p>A notice for particulars may be sent by either party at any stage before the
trial.</p>

<p>The rules applying to notice for particulars are contained in <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/6cc6644045a5c09a80256db700399505/febc8a7cf238651b80256d94005fca17?OpenDocument">Order

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l1f95b">Case progression</h2>

<p>Case progression is a case management system where specific issues in a
dispute are identified and efforts are made to either resolve or narrow those
issues prior to trial. The purpose of case progression is to ensure that the
proceedings for trial are prepared in a manner which is fair, efficient and
likely to keep the costs as low as possible.</p>

<p>A direction that the proceedings be subject to case progression may be given
by the County Registrar or the judge where they are satisfied that it would be
appropriate to do so. The plaintiff or the defendant can also issue a motion
for case progression where they wish to engage in the process.</p>

<p>The County Registrar issues a <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/0f9632235a96242e80256d2b0045bb5c/a3a99514f6aa4784802576a2005846ea?OpenDocument">summons
to attend a case progression hearing</a> with the Registrar, giving not less
than 21 days’ notice. Not later than 7 days before the hearing, the plaintiff
must file at the Circuit Court office an indexed book of pleadings exchanged
between the parties and serve a copy of the index on the defendant.</p>

<p>At the case progression hearing, the County Registrar will establish what
steps remain to be taken to prepare the case for trial and fix a timetable for
the completion of preparation of the case for trial. The Registrar may make
orders or give directions with respect to pleadings and other matters. The
Registrar may on the application of any of the parties or of the Registrar’s
own motion order that the proceedings or any issue therein be adjourned and
invite the parties to use mediation, conciliation, arbitration or other dispute
resolution process to settle or determine the proceedings or issue.</p>

<p>The rules applying to case progression are contained in <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/6cc6644045a5c09a80256db700399505/3fa0d9ef770a1ada802576a2005734d6?OpenDocument">Order

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld6c18">Setting down for trial</h2>

<p>When a defence has been delivered, the plaintiff can serve a <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/0f9632235a96242e80256d2b0045bb5c/42f3cea8f625b69580256f2400617145?OpenDocument">notice

for the fixing of a date for trial</a>, as directed by the County Registrar.
Not less than 10 days’ notice of trial should be given, unless otherwise
agreed, and the notice should be filed at the Circuit Court office.</p>

<p>If the plaintiff fails to serve notice of trial within 10 days of the
delivery of the defence, the defendant can serve notice of trial on the
plaintiff. Alternatively, the defendant can apply to the court to dismiss the
action for want of prosecution.</p>

<p>The rules applying to setting down for trial are contained in <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/6cc6644045a5c09a80256db700399505/1eb7beac0df9e4b080256d940061fb74?OpenDocument">Order

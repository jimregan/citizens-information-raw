<p>The doctrine of privilege allows you to refuse to disclose
		  documents to the court and to refuse to answer certain questions even when
		  those documents or questions are relevant to the case. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>
<p>There are two main types of privilege:</p>
<ul><li>Private privilege</li>
<li>Public interest privilege. </li>
</ul><h3>Private privilege</h3>
<p>You have a "privilege against self-incrimination". This
		  means that you can refuse to answer questions or hand over documents that may
		  implicate you in criminal proceedings. </p>
<p>You may have a "legal professional privilege". A legal
		  advisor and his or her client cannot be forced to disclose communications
		  between them. </p>
<p>In addition, if any communication is made in contemplation of
		  litigation (i.e., with a court case in mind), then that communication is
		  privileged even if it is not a communication between lawyer and client. </p>
<p>Priests are allowed to refuse to answer questions relating to what
		  was said in the confessional. This is known as the "sacerdotal
		  privilege". Similarly, communications with a counsellor may also be
		  privileged. </p>
<h3>Public interest privilege</h3>
<p>This is privilege claimed by the State. In some very limited
		  circumstances, the State may refuse to disclose information or documents in
		  order to protect the public interest. For example, documents relating to the
		  structure and engineering of army equipment might be held to be privileged in
		  order to protect national security. </p>

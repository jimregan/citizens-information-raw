<p>In any court case, whether
		  <a shape="rect" href="../criminal_law/criminal_trial/criminal_trial.html">criminal</a> or
		  <a shape="rect" href="../civil_law/taking_a_civil_case_intro.html">civil</a>,
		  evidence may be introduced by both sides. Evidence is something that tends to
		  prove or disprove a particular fact - it makes the existence or non-existence
		  of that fact more likely.</p>
<p>The law of evidence lays down rules to decide what items of
		  evidence may be introduced to prove facts in a trial. An item of evidence is
		  described as "inadmissible" if the law of evidence does not allow it to be
		  introduced at a trial. Conversely, an item of evidence is described as
		  "admissible" if the law of evidence allows it to be introduced to prove or
		  disprove a particular fact.</p>
<p>In this section, you will find information on a wide range of types
		  of evidence and you will find out when those types of evidence may be
		  admissible or inadmissible in a case. We will consider the oral testimony of
		  witnesses, <a shape="rect" href="real_evidence.html">real evidence</a> and
		  <a shape="rect" href="documentary_evidence.html">documentary evidence</a>. We will
		  also consider <a shape="rect" href="hearsay_evidence.html">hearsay evidence</a>,
		  <a shape="rect" href="circumstantial_evidence.html">circumstantial evidence</a>,
		  <a shape="rect" href="unlawfully_obtained_evidence.html">unlawfully obtained
		  evidence</a>, <a shape="rect" href="identification_evidence.html">identification
		  evidence</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../arrests/unlawful_arrest_and_detention.html">confessions</a>.</p>
<p>Some evidence may be relevant and it may be admissible but it may
		  be <a shape="rect" href="privileged_evidence.html">privileged evidence</a> so it
		  cannot be introduced. Other evidence may be admissible but may be
		  <a shape="rect" href="suspect_evidence.html">suspect evidence</a> so that certain
		  safeguards have to be put in place to protect the accused.</p><p>The rules on what may be admitted in evidence in a criminal trial are complex. The Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides for the admissibility of statements which were made by witnesses and which the witness subsequently refuses to stand over.  The court now has the power to decide whether or not to admit such a statement and the Act sets out guidelines for the court in making the decision.</p>

<p>Circumstantial evidence is evidence of facts from which inferences
		  or can be drawn. </p>
<p>For example, in an assault case where the crime took place on
		  O'Connell Street at 6.15pm, you may give evidence that you saw the accused
		  walking down O'Connell Street at 6pm. In that situation, you are giving
		  circumstantial evidence to the court. </p>
<p>Inferences or conclusions may be drawn from the fact that the
		  accused was on O'Connell Street at 6pm, but you have not given evidence as to
		  the actual fact at issue in the case - whether the accused attacked a person.
		  </p>
<p>In a case of a theft, examples of circumstantial evidence
		  include:</p>
<ul><li>Evidence of the defendant's fingerprints at the scene of the
			 crime</li>
<li>The fact that the defendant was found with a large amount of
			 money without being able to give any reason</li>
</ul><p>In the case of a murder, examples of circumstantial evidence
		  include:</p>
<ul><li>The fact that the accused had an intense dislike of the
			 victim</li>
<li>The fact that the accused behaved in a bizarre and suspicious
			 way after the offence</li>
<li>The fact that he or she lied about his or her
			 alibi</li>
<li>The fact that he or she was in the area at the time that the
			 offence was committed</li>
<li>The fact that the defendant's blood or

			 the victim's body.</li>
</ul></div>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>
<p>The general rule is that circumstantial evidence is admissible.
		  However, the courts are careful when the only evidence in a case is
		  circumstantial evidence. </p>
<p>Circumstantial evidence must be closely examined and it must be
		  looked at cumulatively. In other words, a court would be very slow to convict a
		  defendant on the basis of one piece of circumstantial evidence alone, for
		  example, the fact that his or her fingerprints were found at the scene of the
		  crime. </p>
<p>However, if there are a number of different strands of
		  circumstantial evidence, taken together, they have more weight. For example, in
		  a theft case, if the defendant was seen in the area at the time of the theft,
		  his or her fingerprints were found at the scene of the crime and if he or she
		  was later found with a large sum of money that he or she could not explain,
		  then the court would be more likely to convict the accused. </p>

<p>The
		  <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Irish
		  Constitution</a> guarantees the people of Ireland certain
		  <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/irish_constitution_1/constitution_fundamental_rights.html">fundamental
		  rights</a>. Sometimes, the Gardai or the prosecution in a case can obtain
		  evidence for a trial in breach of your fundamental rights. This means that the
		  evidence has been got in circumstances where your constitutional rights have
		  not been respected. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>
<p>It has been held by the courts that evidence obtained in
		  "deliberate and conscious" breach of your constitutional rights is
		  inadmissible. "Deliberate and conscious" does not mean
		  "intentionally" or "maliciously". It can include a
		  situation where the breach of your constitutional rights was an inadvertent
		  mistake. </p>
<p>An example of evidence obtained in breach of your constitutional
		  rights would be evidence found in your dwelling by the Gardai without a search
		  warrant. This is a breach of your constitutional right not to have your
		  dwelling violated without your consent except in accordance with law. Evidence
		  obtained on foot on an <a shape="rect" href="../arrests/unlawful_arrest_and_detention.html">unlawful
		  arrest or detention</a> is also inadmissible. </p>
<p>In some situations, evidence may be obtained in breach of
		  legislation rather than in breach of the Constitution. For example, you have no
		  constitutional right to be told that you have a right to see a solicitor while
		  you are in detention. However, the Criminal Justice Acts do require that your
		  right to legal access be brought to your attention. </p>
<p>If you are not told about your right to see a solicitor and you
		  then make a statement to the police, that evidence is not automatically
		  inadmissible. It is up to the judge to decide whether or not to allow it to be
		  introduced as evidence. </p>

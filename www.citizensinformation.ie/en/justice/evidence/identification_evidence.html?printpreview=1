<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>People who are suspects in a criminal investigation are often identified by
witnesses and the identification of a suspect will be relied on by the
prosecution in a criminal trial. Visual identification evidence is considered
unreliable and innocent people have been convicted of crimes based on visual
identification evidence. There are a number of logical reasons why such
identification evidence is not reliable. Among these are:</p>
<ul><li>Poor lighting conditions, bad weather or the distance from which the
    witness saw the person </li>
  <li>The eye-sight of the witness may be in question </li>
  <li>The witness may have been in shock or may have only seen the person for a
    brief moment</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="le9c81">Visual identification evidence</h2>

<p>In order to ensure that identification evidence is not incorrectly
interpreted by a jury, the courts are obliged to give each jury a special
warning about the dangers of accepting visual identification evidence. This
warning is not a <a shape="rect" href="suspect_evidence.html">corroboration
warning</a> but it must: </p>
<ul><li>State that honest witnesses with good observation opportunities have
    often made incorrect identifications, even at an identification parade.
  </li>
  <li>Carefully examine the identification evidence in the light of all the
    circumstances. </li>
  <li>Indicate the need for particular caution. </li>
  <li>Point out that the jury must be satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt
    that the identification was correct.</li>
</ul><h3>Photographs </h3>

<p>Gardaí often show <a shape="rect" href="real_evidence.html">photographs</a> of suspects to witnesses at the
early stages of an investigation. It is best practice by the Gardaí to firstly
obtain a detailed description from the witness prior to any photographs been
shown. This process gives an indication as to the power of the witness’s
memory of the offender before being shown photographs. The witness should also
be shown photographs of many possible suspects.</p>

<p>When a suspect has been identified by a witness using photographs and it is
proposed to put this evidence to the jury, the defence counsel may raise the
issue of the use of the photograph as evidence with the judge, in the absence
of the jury. If the photograph shown to the witness came from Garda files, the
jury would be aware that the suspect had been photographed by the Gardaí on a
previous occasion and this could prejudice the jury. It is then a matter for
the judge to decide whether or not this evidence should be put to the jury.</p>

<h3>Photofits and identikits</h3>

<p>While photofits and identikits are used by the Gardaí in criminal
investigations, their use is more to assist them in trying to identify
potential suspects than for use in a criminal trial. The fact that the photofit
and identikit is unlike a photograph or video, which is real evidence, means
that little weight would be attached to their use as a means of identification
evidence in a court of law. Perhaps the best way to describe them is as an aid
to a criminal investigation.</p>

<h3>Identification parades</h3>

<p>If the Gardaí have already identified a suspect, they should not show the
witness photographs but should conduct an identification parade (ID parade).
This is because if the witness has already seen a photograph of the suspect, it
may affect the witness’s judgement at the ID parade. At the end of the trial,
the judge will warn the jury that the ID parade is suspect evidence because the
witness had already seen a photograph of the accused. </p>

<p>ID parades are dependent on the suspect’s co-operation. Where a suspect
refuses to participate, the Gardaí are entitled to obtain identification by
informal means (for example, where a witness points out the suspect on the
street). However, it is considered that a formal ID parade is much more
reliable and whether informal identification will be admitted as evidence
depends on the circumstances of the case. </p>

<p>The advantage of holding an ID parade is that it is a controlled process and
the suspect’s solicitor is allowed to attend to ensure that the process is
carried out correctly. While ID parades are frequently used by the Gardaí, the
process is not provided for in law. There are, however, a number of formalities
or rules which have developed over time as a result of case law in Ireland. The
following are the main rules in relation to the holding of ID parades:</p>
<ul><li>ID parades should be conducted by a Garda officer who is not connected
    with the crime but who has been made familiar with the circumstances of the
    case and information relevant to the witness. </li>
  <li>The witness should not see the accused being arrested or taken from
    custody to the parade room. </li>
  <li>If several witnesses are required to attempt to identify the suspect they
    should be kept apart before and after the parade to minimise consultation
    between them. </li>
  <li>The witness should be asked to identify the suspect from a line of 8 to
    12 people, chosen because they look similar to the suspect. </li>
  <li>When the volunteers have been arranged in a line, the suspect should be
    asked if he has any objections to the composition or appearance of the
    parade. </li>
  <li>When the parade is completed, the accused and his solicitor should be
    asked whether he has any comments to make with regard to the parade. </li>
  <li>Details of the parade and any objections made by the accused or his
    solicitor must be recorded by the office responsible for conducting the
    parade.</li>
  <li>If a witness fails to identify the accused, this fact should be disclosed
    to the defence by the prosecution. </li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lc8758">Fingerprint evidence</h2>

<p>While fingerprint evidence is accepted as a form of identification, this
form of identification evidence must be given by an expert witness (a
fingerprint expert). However, in order that fingerprint evidence can be used,
the Gardaí or prosecution must be able to match a fingerprint left by a
culprit at the scene of a crime with that of a set of fingerprints taken from
the accused in a controlled situation (that is, taken in a Garda station).</p>

<p>There are certain requirements in law whereby if you are detained after
arrest you are obliged to provide the Gardaí with your fingerprints. Refusal
to allow the Gardaí to take your fingerprints may have consequences for you at
your trial.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lda0ce">Forensic evidence</h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0034/index.html">Criminal
Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990</a> gives the Gardaí the power to take
certain samples from any person who is detained after arrest under: </p>
<ul><li>Section 30 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1939/en/act/pub/0013/index.html">Offences
    Against the State Act 1939</a> </li>
  <li>Section 4 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1984/en/act/pub/0022/index.html">Criminal
    Justice Act 1984</a> </li>
  <li>Section 2 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0029/index.html">Criminal
    Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996</a> </li>
  <li>Section 50 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2007/a2907.pdf">Criminal
    Justice Act 2007</a> </li>
</ul><p>The purpose of taking these samples is to assist the Gardaí in establishing
whether or not the person was involved in the commission of the crime. This is
another form of identification of a suspect but has the added advantage of also
being able to eliminate suspects. </p>

<p>The following are the samples which the Gardaí are allowed take for
forensic testing. A sample of:- </p>
<ul><li>Blood </li>
  <li>Pubic hair </li>
  <li>Urine </li>
  <li>Saliva </li>
  <li>Hair other than pubic hair </li>
  <li>A nail </li>
  <li>Any material found under a nail </li>
  <li>A swab from any part of the body other than a body orifice or genital
    region </li>
  <li>A swab from a body orifice or a genital region </li>
  <li>A dental impression </li>
  <li>A footprint or similar impression of any part of the person’s body
    other than a part of their hand or mouth </li>
</ul><p>None of the above samples are taken unless authorised by a member of the
Gardaí not below the rank of Superintendent. The actual taking of the samples
will be performed by a doctor or dentist except for the samples which are not
specialised or intimate samples. These samples such as head hair may be taken
by a Garda. <a shape="rect" href="real_evidence.html">More information on
forensic evidence is available in the document on real evidence</a>. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l6c3d6">DNA evidence</h2>

<p>The courts in Ireland accept identification proved by DNA evidence. DNA
testing can be done on a tiny sample of blood, semen or any body tissue. These
may be obtained at the scene of a crime and can also be obtained from suspects.
When a DNA test is done, a profile of the DNA is taken. </p>

<p>DNA profiling refers to the identification of particular parts of the DNA.
The profile from the sample can be compared to a suspect’s DNA profile to see
if they match. <a shape="rect" href="photographic_evidence.html">More
information is available in the document on DNA evidence</a>. </p>

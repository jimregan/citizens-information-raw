<p>A statement made out of court cannot be introduced in court to
		  prove the content of the statement. For example, if you are a witness in a
		  trial, you cannot give the following evidence "My mother told me she saw
		  the accused at 3pm". This is evidence of a statement made out of court and
		  it is "hearsay". For that evidence to be introduced, your mother must
		  take the stand and describe what she herself saw. </p>
<p>Not all out-of-court statements are hearsay. For example, if an
		  accused is claiming that he or she is dumb, you may give evidence that you saw
		  and heard him or her say "I want an ice-cream". This evidence is not
		  being introduced to prove that the accused wanted an ice-cream, but it is being
		  introduced to prove that he or she can speak. For that reason, it is
		  admissible. </p>
<p>The most important exception to the hearsay rule is admission or
		  confession evidence. It is generally assumed that a party in a case would not
		  make a statement against his or her own interests unless the statement was
		  true. </p>
<p>This means that you may give evidence that the accused said to you
		  on the day that the victim died; "I did it. I killed him". Normally,
		  this would be hearsay evidence as it is an out-of-court statement and it has
		  been introduced to prove that the accused killed the deceased. However, because
		  confessions are an exception to the rule against hearsay, that evidence will be
		  admissible.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>
<p>The general rule is that hearsay evidence is not admissible. If you
		  are giving evidence and start to say something that amounts to hearsay
		  evidence, you may be interrupted by one of the parties in the case or the judge
		  and asked to stop. </p>

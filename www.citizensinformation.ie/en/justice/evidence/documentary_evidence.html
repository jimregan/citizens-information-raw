<h3>Criminal cases</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0012/index.html">Criminal
Evidence Act 1992</a> deals with the rules that cover the admissibility of
documentary evidence in <a shape="rect" href="../criminal_law/criminal_trial/criminal_trial.html">criminal
proceedings</a>. In order that a court will accept documentary evidence in a
criminal trial there are a number of safeguards in place to avoid abuse against
the <a shape="rect" href="hearsay_evidence.html">hearsay rule of
evidence</a>.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0012/sec0008.html#sec8">Section
8 of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992</a> gives the court discretion to exclude a
document in the interests of justice, having regard to the circumstances. If a
court is of the view that the document is unreliable, a fake or would result in
unfairness to the accused, then the court has the option of excluding the
document from the evidence.</p>

<p>The Act also allows either side (prosecution or defence) to challenge the
credibility of the documentary evidence and to give evidence to the court in
this regard.</p>

<p>If the Gardai or prosecution wish to have any documentary evidence included
in a court case a copy of the document must be served on the accused at least
21 days before the court case.</p>

<p>Before the Criminal Evidence Act 1992, there was a best evidence rule, which
stated that it was necessary to produce the original of a document for it to be
introduced as evidence in a criminal case. It is, however, now possible to
introduce a copy of a document as evidence.</p>

<h3>Civil cases</h3>

<p>In <a shape="rect" href="../civil_law/taking_a_civil_case_intro.html">civil
cases</a> the best evidence rule still applies. However, there are exceptions
to the rule. The court will accept a copy of the document, or oral evidence
about the existence and content of the document, if the original has been
destroyed or lost, or is impossible to obtain. </p>

<p>DNA stands for "deoxyribunucleic acid" and it is the blueprint for your
genetic makeup. DNA is composed of a pattern of bands (a little like a bar
code) and the arrangement of the bands is unique to every person. There are
some common features between the pattern of bands of parents, their children
and other relatives. </p>

<h3>DNA testing</h3>

<p>DNA testing can be done on a tiny sample of blood, semen or any body tissue.
When a DNA test is done, a "profile" of the DNA is taken. DNA testing can be
very useful evidence, for example:</p>
<ul><li>DNA can be used to <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/separation_and_divorce/presumption_of_paternity.html">establish
    paternity</a>. If your DNA is compared to another person's, it can be
    established whether you are the parent of that person. </li>
  <li>DNA can also be used to prove identity. For example, if a sample of blood
    is found at the scene of the crime, a DNA test can be performed on that
    blood to work out the DNA "profile". That DNA "profile" can then be
    compared to a suspect's DNA sample. That way, it can be established whether
    the blood found at the scene of the crime is the suspect's blood. </li>
</ul><p>The Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides that mouth swabs and hair samples
will no longer be considered as "intimate samples" , this means that your
consent is not required for taking them. </p>

<p>When DNA evidence is introduced in court, it is always explained by an
expert witness. The expert will tell the court how often that "profile" is
found in the general population. For example, the expert may tell the court
that this "profile" is found in approximately 1 person in every 1,000,000
people. </p>

<h3>Criminal Law and Procedure: Establishment of a DNA Database</h3>

<p>The Law Reform Commission of Ireland published a <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/consultation%20papers/cpDNADatabase.pdf">Consultation
Paper on the Establishment of a DNA Database</a> in March 2004. The publication
of this Consultation Paper followed a request in 2003 by the Ireland's Attorney
General to consider the issue. Recommendations made by the Commission examined
the broad and complex constitutional and human rights issues that may arise;
and secondly, the more specific question of what classes of DNA profiles would
make up any database. </p>

<p>The Law Reform Commission Paper drew clear distinctions between DNA samples
and DNA profiles in making its recommendations, concluding that profiles only
would be retained on the database. The Commission made a provisional
recommendation on the establishment of a limited DNA Database, in which
profiles of those reasonably suspected of, and convicted of, serious crimes
would be retained on the database. </p>

<p>The Consultation Paper also addressed the issue of who should regulate and
maintain the DNA Database, recommending that an independent State Forensic
Agency be established for this purpose. The Law Reform Commission published
their <a shape="rect" href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/Reports/rDNADatabase.pdf">final
Report on the Establishment of a DNA Database (pdf) in November, 2005</a>. </p>

<p>In June 2014 the Oireachtas passed the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2014/en.act.2014.0011.pdf">Criminal
Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014 (pdf)</a>.</p>

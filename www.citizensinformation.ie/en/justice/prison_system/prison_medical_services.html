<p>While someone is in prison, they can expect to be provided with medical,
dental, psychiatric and psychological care. A Director who is a medical
specialist heads the Prison Medical Service. </p>

<p>Section 35 of the <span class="link-external"><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/act/pub/0010/index.html">Prisons
Act 2007</a></span> came into effect in May 2007 and provides for the making of
prison rules. Prison rules set out the the various conditions in prisons in
Ireland and include all aspects of admission, registration, accommodation,
visiting rights, health, discipline, education, etc. The new Act extends the
range of matters covered by prison rules. The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/si/0252.html">prison rules (SI No.
252/2007)</a> came into operation in October 2007.</p>

<h3>Medical Services</h3>

<p>Medical doctors provide medical services in all prisons. They must pay
particular attention to prisoners with psychiatric problems. </p>

<p>Professionally qualified nurses assist the prison doctors and the nurses
provide 24-hour cover in closed prisons.</p>

<p>If a prisoner needs hospital treatment, they will be transferred to outside
hospitals, after a recommendation by the prison doctor. They may also be taken
to local hospitals for outpatient treatment if it is required. </p>

<h3>Psychiatric Services </h3>

<p>If someone needs psychiatric treatment while they are in prison, this will
be provided by visiting psychiatrists employed by the <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/how_health_is_organised/health_boards.html">Health Service
Executive (HSE)</a>. </p>

<p>If the psychiatrist and the prison doctor consider that you are in need of
in-patient psychiatric treatment, you may be transferred to either the Central
Mental Hospital or a district mental hospital. </p>

<p>Counselling and care support will also be provided after your release from
prison at the HSE's day centre at Usher's Island in Dublin.</p>

<h3>Psychology Service</h3>

<p>If a prisoner needs psychological treatment while in prison, it will be
provided by the <a href="http://www.irishprisons.ie/index.php/prisoner-services/psychology-service/">Psychology
Service</a>. </p>

<p>The main function of the Psychology Service is to provide prisoners with
on-going therapy and supportive counselling. This counselling aims to increase
awareness of problems and help to develop alternative strategies for dealing
with criminal behaviour. </p>

<p>The Psychology Service also provides a variety of <a shape="rect" href="sex_offenders_treatment_programmes.html">programmes for sex offenders</a>
and a cognitive skills course for prisoners.</p>

<h3>Dental Services</h3>

<p>Dental treatment is provided on a similar basis to that available in the
general community under the Medical Card scheme. In the Dublin prisons, dental
services are provided by means of a contract arrangement with the Dublin Dental
Hospital for the provision of dental staff to the prisons, while, elsewhere,
local dentists provide the service.</p>

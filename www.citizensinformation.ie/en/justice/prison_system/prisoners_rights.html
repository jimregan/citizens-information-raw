<p>The <a href="../../government_in_ireland/irish_constitution_1/constitution_fundamental_rights.html">Constitution</a>
recognises and declares that people living in Ireland have certain fundamental
personal rights. These rights may be derived or implied from the Constitution.
The Courts decide what the Constitution means.</p>

<p>Fundamental rights are not absolute – they can be limited or restricted by
the Oireachtas on the grounds, for example, of the common good.</p>

<p>Ireland has agreed to follow the terms of 4 international treaties which lay
out standards for the treatment of prisoners. These are:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=basictexts&amp;c=">European
    Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=126&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=29/06/2015&amp;CL=ENG">European
    Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment
    or Punishment</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx">International
    Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/cat/pages/catindex.aspx">Convention
    against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
    Punishment (CAT)</a></li>
</ul><p>There is also the Council of Europe’s <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/prisons/default_en.asp">European
Prison Rules</a> which give guidance on standards for prisons.</p>

<p>The main source of prisoners’ rights is the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/si/0252.html">Prison Rules
2007</a> as <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ResultsSITitle.html?q=Prison+Rules&amp;q=2013&amp;q=2015&amp;search_type=si&amp;button=Search">amended</a>.</p>

<p>The following is an overview of how prison affects the daily life and
associated rights of an individual.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l72670">Rights</h2>

<h3>Right to marry</h3>

<p>The courts have not yet decided that you have a right to marry while you are
in prison.</p>

<h3>Right to procreate and/or conjugal rights</h3>

<p>You do not have a right to temporary release or conjugal visits.</p>

<p>If you are married, you have a right to communicate with your spouse, but
without privacy. You also have a right to take some part in the education of
your children.</p>

<h3>Right to vote</h3>

<p>You have a right to be registered in the political constituency where you
would normally live if you were not in prison. However, you have no right to be
given physical access to a ballot box by temporary release.</p>

<p>If you happen to be on parole or temporary release at the time of an
election, you are free to vote where you are registered.</p>

<p>Your rights if you are on <a href="../arrests/detention_after_arrest.html">remand</a> are the same as if
you were a convicted prisoner.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0033/index.html">Electoral
(Amendment) Act 2006</a> provides procedures that enable prisoners to vote by
post. If you are in prison, you can register for a postal vote in the area that
you would otherwise be living in. If you are already registered to vote in that
area and wish to be able to vote from prison then you should fill out a form
called Form RFG. If you are not already on the register then you should
complete Form RFA4 as well. These application forms are available in all
prisons and should be sent to the local authority for your area.</p>

<h3>Right to associate</h3>

<p>You have a right to communicate with other prisoners while you are working
or at recreation. However, you must communicate in an orderly way and you
cannot impede the other prisoners' work.</p>

<p>The governor of the prison can take away this right in the interest of good
order in the prison.</p>

<h3>Right to privacy</h3>

<p>You have a limited right to privacy. For example, you may not to be
stripped, searched or bathed in the presence of another prisoner. In addition,
you have the right to be exposed to the public view as little as possible while
being removed from or to prison. However, you may be photographed. Your right
to privacy may be limited for security reasons.</p>

<h3>Rights relating to searches and drug testing</h3>

<p>You may be searched and you may only be searched by officers of the same
sex. The search must be done with due regard to your decency and self-respect
and in as appropriate a manner as possible. At no stage should you be left
completely naked.</p>

<p>You might have to give a hair, urine or saliva sample for the purpose of
detecting the presence or use of alcohol, a controlled drug or a medicinal
product.</p>

<p>A search can only be carried out for a genuine purpose, for example, to find
forbidden items. A search cannot be carried out simply to harass you.</p>

<h3>Right to freedom from discrimination</h3>

<p>You have the same right to freedom from discrimination as any other
citizen.</p>

<h3>Right to recreation</h3>

<p>If you are involved in indoor work at the prison, you are entitled to daily
exercise in the open air for one hour or more.</p>

<p>Where possible, you must be provided with access to indoor space and
equipment, suitable for physical recreation, exercise or training.</p>

<h3>Right to property</h3>

<p>You do not have the right to keep money in prison. You are not allowed to
keep all the money and effects you brought into the prison or were sent to the
prison for your use. They will be placed in the custody of the governor, who
will keep an inventory of them. The money will be lodged into an account for
your use.</p>

<h3>Right to bodily integrity</h3>

<p>You have a limited right to bodily integrity. For example, a prisoner's hair
cannot be cut without their consent unless the prison doctor considers it
necessary on health grounds.</p>

<h3>Right to earn a livelihood</h3>

<p>You do not have a right to run a business or earn a livelihood from
prison.</p>

<h3>Right to freedom of religion</h3>

<p>You do have a right to practise your religion. The prison will provide for
basic religious needs but you do not have a right to special requirements.</p>

<p>When you arrive in prison, you will state your religious denomination and if
there is no service provided in the prison for your denomination, the prison
will allow a religious instructor visit you.</p>

<h3>Right to food</h3>

<p>While you are in prison, you must be given a healthy, well balanced and
reasonably varied diet. Where possible, provision is made to enable a prisoner
to observe the dietary practices of their religion or culture. The prison
medical officer can approve a change of diet.</p>

<h3>Right to education</h3>

<p>You have a right to education while you are in prison.</p>

<h3>Rights of mothers</h3>

<p>The child of a female prisoner can be taken into the prison to facilitate
breast feeding, until the child is 12 months of age. The child may not be taken
from its mother until the medical officer certifies that it is in a fit
condition to be removed.</p>

<p>Except in special circumstances, the child will not be kept in the prison
after it is 12 months old.</p>

<p>Before taking a child out of prison, the governor must consult with the
child’s mother and the <a href="http://www.tusla.ie/">Child and Family
Agency</a> as to the appropriate placement for the child.</p>

<h3>Right to smoke</h3>

<p>Prisoners do not have a right to smoke except in accordance with rules laid
down by the governor. </p>

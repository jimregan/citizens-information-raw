<p>If a member of your family is in prison, visits can help you keep in touch.
You can also keep in touch by letter and your family member can contact you by
telephone.</p>

<p>Generally, a prisoner is asked to nominate up to 6 people who may visit
them. If you are not on the list you will not be able to visit.</p>

<p>There are rules about how many visits a prisoner is allowed and how the
visits are conducted.</p>

<p>The names and details of all visitors are recorded, particularly young
people under the age of 18 whose full name, date of birth, address and
relationship to the prisoner should be included. All visits must be <a href="http://www.irishprisons.ie/index.php/visiting-a-prison/">booked in
advance</a> on the prison telephone booking line. For some prisons you can book
a visit online or in person at the visitors centre.</p>

<p>You should make sure that you have the right form of identification with you
when visiting your family member. A current passport or driving licence would
be suitable. If you do not have either, you should check what else would be
acceptable when booking your visit.</p>

<p>No more than 3 adults can come on a visit at the same time so make sure that
no one else is visiting your family member on the same day. Generally, there is
no limit on the number of children, but this can vary from prison to prison.
Anyone under 18 years must usually be accompanied by an adult.</p>

<p>If you want to take things in for your family member, you must check what is
allowed with the prison in advance. Anything you take in must be handed to the
officer in charge of visits.</p>

<p>You cannot bring a mobile phone into the prison. Visitors are required to
deposit their phones and any personal items in the area provided at the
visitors centre before entering the prison.</p>

<p>Information on <a href="http://www.irishprisons.ie/index.php/visiting-a-prison/what-to-expect-when-visiting-a-prison/">what
to expect when visiting</a> is available on the Irish Prison Service
website.</p>

<p>If you have been imprisoned and part of your sentence is remitted, this
means that you do not have to remain in prison for the full period of your
sentence. For example, if you have been sentenced to 8 years’ imprisonment,
you may be released after 6 years. In other words, the remaining 2 years of
your sentence are remitted.</p>

<p>Temporary release means that you are released from prison for a specified
period of time for a specific purpose or reason.</p>

<h3>Remission</h3>

<p>Under Rule 59 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/si/0252.html">Prison Rules
2007</a> as <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ResultsSITitle.html?q=Prison+Rules&amp;q=2013&amp;q=2015&amp;search_type=si&amp;button=Search">amended</a>,
the vast majority of prisoners serving sentences are entitled to remission at a
rate of one quarter. In practice, this means that a person sentenced to 4
years’ imprisonment will be expected to serve 3 years in custody. However,
part of this remission may be cancelled as disciplinary punishment. Whether or
not you get remission depends on your good behaviour while you are in
prison.</p>

<p>On application by a prisoner, the Minister for Justice and Equality can
grant enhanced remission of up to one third of the sentence. The prisoner must
have shown further good conduct by engaging in authorised structured activities
and the Minister must be satisfied that, as a result, the prisoner is less
likely to re-offend and will be better able to reintegrate into the
community.</p>

<p>Prisoners who cannot benefit from remission include those serving life
sentences.</p>

<h3>Temporary release</h3>

<p>There are 3 kinds of temporary release:</p>
<ul><li>Temporary release on compassionate ground for a specified period. This is
    normally granted where urgent family or domestic circumstances arise.</li>
  <li>Day-to-day temporary release. This is normally to go to a job outside the
    prison during the day and return to the prison at night. This is usually
    considered when a prisoner is coming close to the end of their
  sentence.</li>
  <li>Full temporary release until the end of the sentence. This is normally
    granted if a prisoner has been progressing well on day-to-day temporary
    release.</li>
</ul><p>When the Minister is deciding whether to grant temporary release, a number
of different factors are considered:</p>
<ul><li>The nature and circumstances of the crime you committed</li>
  <li>Your own attitude towards rehabilitation</li>
  <li>Your educational, training and employment needs and opportunities</li>
  <li>Your behaviour while in prison</li>
  <li>Your family background and the general background</li>
</ul><p>If you are granted temporary release, it will be subject to certain
conditions including:</p>
<ul><li>The requirement to keep the peace and maintain good behaviour during the
    period of release</li>
  <li>The requirement to maintain sober habits</li>
  <li>The requirement not to publish or communicate anything to the media</li>
</ul><p>You will sign a release form acknowledging that:</p>
<ul><li>You are aware of the terms and conditions of your release</li>
  <li>Those terms have been explained to you</li>
  <li>You are aware of the time when your period of release ends</li>
</ul><p>While you are outside the prison, you may be considered to be unlawfully at
large and may be arrested when:</p>
<ul><li>The period of release has ended or</li>
  <li>A condition of your release has been broken</li>
</ul><p>If you are discharged from prison whether on temporary or permanent release,
the Governor must ensure that you have:</p>
<ul><li>Sufficient means for travelling to your destination within the State</li>
  <li>Suitable clothing to wear</li>
  <li>Sufficient means to live on, as is considered appropriate in the
    circumstances</li>
</ul></div>

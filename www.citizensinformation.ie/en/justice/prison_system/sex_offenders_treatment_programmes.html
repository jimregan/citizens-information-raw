<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>In April 2009, the <a href="http://www.irishprisons.ie/images/pdf/sexoffenderspolicy.pdf">Sex
Offender Management Policy â€“ Reducing Re-offending, Enhancing Public Safety
(pdf)</a> was announced. It concerns therapeutic interventions with sex
offenders while they are in prison. The policy is aimed at bringing about
changes in offenders' lives that reduce the risk of re-offending. Some of the
initiatives announced had already been introduced.</p>

<p>Under the policy <a href="http://www.irishprisons.ie/index.php/prison/arbour-hill/">Arbour Hill
Prison</a> is designated as the national centre for imprisoned sex offenders
with a full range of therapeutic interventions available. <a href="http://www.irishprisons.ie/index.php/portlaoise-prison-campus/midlands-prison">Midlands
Prison</a> and <a href="http://www.irishprisons.ie/index.php/west-dublin-prison-campus/wheatfield-place-of-detention">Wheatfield
Place of Detention</a> are designated as satellite centres where a narrower
range of therapeutic interventions are available. Prisoners committed initially
to other prisons are transferred to the satellite centres unless exceptional
circumstances prevail.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l53d28">Therapeutic interventions</h2>

<p>There is a range of therapeutic interventions.</p>

<h3>Structured clinical assessments</h3>

<p>Sex offenders are assessed soon after committal and this assessment
influences all subsequent therapeutic interventions. Re-assessment can take
place during the sentence, where appropriate.</p>

<h3>One-to-one therapeutic interventions</h3>

<p>Individual therapeutic work serves a number of functions, including:</p>
<ul><li>Support for offenders in their early commitment to change </li>
  <li>Support for the integration and extension of progress made in group work
  </li>
  <li>Addressing the risks and needs of offenders who are unable to undertake
    group programmes </li>
</ul><h3>Offence-related therapeutic group interventions</h3>

<p>The Building Better Lives sex offender programme started in 2009. It is made
up of 3 components:</p>
<ul><li>The Exploring Better Lives programme aims to develop motivation and
    confidence about positive change</li>
  <li>The Practising Better Lives programme focuses on obtaining a more
    detailed understanding of past offending and developing positive
    offence-free self-management plans for the future</li>
  <li>The Maintaining Better Lives programme aims to support ongoing progress
    and development for men who are serving longer sentences in prison and to
    ensure a throughcare plan from prison to community-based supports</li>
</ul><h3>In-reach services</h3>

<p>In-reach services uses the potential of community-based services to provide
interventions within the prison environment. An example is the motivational
enhancement groups operated by the Granada Institute in the Midlands and
Wheatfield prisons. The purpose of the motivational intervention is to help
participants explore the potential benefits of therapeutic engagement.</p>

<p>Prison rules regulate the operation of prisons. <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/act/pub/0010/sec0035.html#sec35">Section
35 of the Prisons Act 2007</a> provides for the making of prison rules which
may cover the treatment of prisoners, including their diets, clothing,
maintenance, employment, instruction, discipline and correction. <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/si/0252.html">Prison Rules (SI No.
252/2007)</a> came into operation in October 2007. They have been <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ResultsSITitle.html?q=Prison+Rules&amp;q=2013&amp;q=2015&amp;search_type=si&amp;button=Search">amended</a>
more recently to provide for, among other things, investigation of serious
complaints.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Diet</h3>

<p>A healthy, well-balanced and reasonably varied diet is supplied to all
persons in custody in accordance with prison regulations. Where possible,
provision is made to enable a prisoner to observe the dietary practices of
their religion or culture. A change of diet can be obtained following approval
of the prison medical officer.</p>

<h3>Hygiene, clothing and bedding</h3>

<p>Prisoners are not required to wear a uniform but are supplied with a range
of clothing in fashion in the community. Clothing may be changed twice weekly.
In certain circumstances, a prisoner may wear their own clothing. If permission
for this is given, the prisoner is required to have sufficient clothing to
allow for a change. Changes of underclothing are supplied to all prisoners.</p>

<p>All prisoners are entitled to wash daily and shower at least once per week.
Cell bedding must be adequate for warmth and health, and is usually comprised
of bed mattress, blanket, pillow and sheets.</p>

<h3>Recreation</h3>

<p>Prisoners are free to take part in recreation at weekends, in the evenings
and when not attending work or educational classes. Facilities include
television, table games and library facilities.</p>

<p>There is increasing use being made of gym activities and outdoor games.
Specially trained prison officers provide gym instruction and supervision.</p>

<h3>Visits</h3>

<p>The Prison Rules provides the legislation for <a href="visiting_someone_in_prison.html">visiting arrangements</a>. Under
these rules, a sentenced prisoner is entitled 1 visit per week of at least 30
minutes duration. A remand prisoner is entitled to 1 visit of at least 15
minutes duration on each of 3 days of the week and where possible, on each of 6
days. In practice, additional or longer visits may be granted where
circumstances permit at the Governor's discretion.</p>

<p>The Governor can restrict the number of visitors at the one time to 3 per
offender. The majority of visits are supervised in sight and in hearing, of
prison staff to ensure good order and security and to prevent the passing of
contraband. The frequency and length of visits can vary according to the type
of institution. There are also local procedures individual to each institution
concerning, for example, searches, persons allowed visit and opening hours.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>

<p>Prisoners are generally entitled to send letters to their family or friends
and there is no limit to the number of letters that may be received from them.
A prisoner on remand can also send as many letters as is necessary to manage
their property or business affairs. A prisoner who sends more than 7 letters
during a week may be required to pay for postage and writing materials in
respect of the extra letters.</p>

<p>All incoming and outgoing mail may be opened and checked by a prison office
with the exception of legal correspondence, which is opened to confirm its
status and then placed back into the envelope.</p>

<h3>Rehabilitative measures</h3>

<p>The Prison Service encourage prisoners to engage with the therapeutic
services during their period of imprisonment in order to reduce the risk of
them re-offending on release and to help offenders live constructive and
meaningful lives on the outside. There is a wide range of services available
including:</p>
<ul><li><a href="prison_education_services.html">Education</a> – prisoners
    may take classes ranging from basic literacy to Open University degrees</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.irishprisons.ie/index.php/services-for-prisoners/drug-treatment">Drug
    treatment</a> – prisoners have access to a range of medical and
    rehabilitative services</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.irishprisons.ie/index.php/psychology-service">Psychology</a>
    – provides mental health services and helps offenders address factors
    that put them at risk of re-offending </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.irishprisons.ie/index.php/prisoner-services/work-and-vocational-training/">Work
    and training</a> – training activities are chosen to give as much
    employment as possible in prison and to give opportunities to acquire
    skills which help secure employment on release</li>
</ul><p>There is <a href="http://www.irishprisons.ie/index.php/prisoner-services/">further
information on the range of services</a> on the Irish Prison Service website.
</p>

<h3>Chaplaincy service</h3>

<p>A <a href="http://www.irishprisons.ie/index.php/chaplaincy">chaplaincy
service</a> is available in each prison and place of detention. Full-time Roman
Catholic chaplains are attached to most prisons and places of detention.
Chaplains of other denominations come to the prisons on a part-time or visiting
basis. Local Muslim religious leaders attend to the needs of Muslim
prisoners.</p>

<p>The primary function of the chaplaincy service is to make religious services
available to prisoners and to offer support and assistance in their human and
spiritual development.</p>

<h3>Remission</h3>

<p>The vast majority of persons serving sentences are entitled to remission at
a rate of one quarter, providing that they are of good behaviour for the
duration of their sentence. In practice, this means that a person sentenced to
4 years’ imprisonment will be expected to serve 3 years in custody. Prisoners
who cannot benefit from remission include those serving life sentences.</p>

<p>The Minister for Justice and Equality can grant remission of up to one third
where a prisoner has shown further good conduct by engaging in authorised
structured activities and the Minister is satisfied that, as a result, the
prisoner is less likely to re-offend and will be better able to reintegrate
into the community.</p>

<h3>Punishments</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/act/pub/0010/sec0013.html#sec13">Section
13 of the Prisons Act 2007</a> lists sanctions that may be imposed if a
prisoner is found to have breached prison discipline. The possible sanctions
include:</p>
<ul><li>A reprimand</li>
  <li>Confinement in a cell for a period not exceeding 3 days</li>
  <li>Suspension for up to 60 days of involvement in specified authorised
    structured activities or recreational activities</li>
  <li>Loss of up to 14 days’ remission</li>
</ul><h3>Complaints</h3>

<p>Prisoners have the right to make a complaint to any prison staff member
either verbally or in writing at any time. Under the <a href="http://www.irishprisons.ie/index.php/services-for-prisoners/prisoner-complaints">Irish
Prison Service Complaints System</a> there are 6 categories of complaints
depending on the seriousness of the complaint. The most serious is Category A
which covers complaints alleging assault, use of excessive force, ill
treatment, racial abuse, discrimination, intimidation or threats. Category A
complaints are investigated by people from outside the Prison Service.</p>

<h3>Visiting committees</h3>

<p>A visiting committee for a prison is an independent statutory watchdog on
behalf of the public to supervise the treatment of prisoners.</p>

<p>While in prison, prisoners have free access to the visiting committees and
may make complaints about how they are being treated to them. <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PB15000153">Each committee makes an
annual report</a> to the Minister.</p>

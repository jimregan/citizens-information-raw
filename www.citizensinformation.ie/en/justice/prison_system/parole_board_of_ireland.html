<p>If you are a prisoner in Ireland serving a life sentence or a long term
sentence, the issue of your early release from prison may be considered by the
Parole Board of Ireland. </p>

<p>The Board, which replaced the Sentence Review Group, was established on an
administrative basis in 2001. The Board's principal function is to advise the
Minister for Justice and Equality in relation to the administration of
long-term prison sentences.</p>

<p>There are approximately ten members of the Board, including the head of the
Probation Service; the Medical Director of the Central Mental Hospital; senior
officials from the Department of Justice and Equality and various community
representatives. </p>

<h3>When is a prisoner's case reviewed?</h3>

<p>The Parole Board reviews the cases of prisoners sentenced to determinate
(fixed-term) sentences of 8 years or more (but less than 14 years) at half
sentence stage. Prisoners sentenced to 14 years or more, (including life) are
reviewed after 7 years have been served. Prisoners serving sentences for
certain offences (see 'Rules' section below), are excluded from the process.
(In other words, they cannot apply for parole). </p>

<p>The Board advises the Minister of the prisoner's progress to date, the
degree to which the prisoner has engaged with the various therapeutic services
and how best to proceed with the future administration of the sentence.</p>

<p>Where a prisoner is not recommended by the Board for release, a second or
further review of their case will generally take place on <span>an annual
basis</span> if the prisoner is serving <span>less than 10 years</span> for an
offence. Prisoners who have not been recommended by the Board for release and
who are serving <span>more than 10 years</span>, will generally receive
subsequent reviews <span>every 3 years</span>. </p>

<p>Further information including the number and type of cases referred to the
Parole Board, the nature of offences and institutions in which prisoners are
held is available in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PB14000230">Annual Report of the
Parole Board of Ireland</a></p>

<h3>Prisoners not eligible for review by the Parole Board</h3>

<p>Prisoners guilty of the following offences are not (as a general principle)
eligible for review by the Parole Board:</p>
<ul><li>Murder or attempted murder committed within Ireland for a political
    motive, of the head of a foreign country, or of a member of the Government,
    or a diplomat from another country; </li>
  <li>Murder of a member of An Garda Síochána or the Irish Prison Service in
    the course of his or her duty (<a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0016/sec0003.html#zza16y1990s3">Section
    3 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1990</a>); </li>
  <li>Murder or attempted murder as set out in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1939/en/act/pub/0013/sec0006.html#zza13y1939s6">Section
    6 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939</a> or <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1939/en/act/pub/0013/sec0018.html#zza13y1939s18">Section
    18 of that Act</a>. </li>
</ul><p>In making its recommendations, the Parole Board of Ireland considers a
number of factors, which include:</p>
<ul><li>whether the prisoner's release would constitute a threat to the
    community; </li>
  <li>whether it is reasonable to grant early/temporary release in view of the
    nature and circumstances of the offence committed; </li>
  <li>whether the offender warrants release, taking into account his or her
    behaviour in custody; </li>
  <li>whether there are there any compelling compassionate grounds which merit
    special consideration </li>
  <li>whether the offender has engaged constructively with the prison-based
    therapeutic services to combat his/her offending behaviour. </li>
</ul><p>The final decision regarding the recommendations of the Parole Board lies
with the Minister for Justice and Equality. The Minister can choose to accept
the Board's recommendations in their entirety, accept them in part or reject
them.</p>

<p>In deciding on the release of a prisoner with a life sentence, the Minister
will always consider the advice and recommendations of the Parole Board. The
Board, at present, initially reviews prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment
at the seven-year stage of their sentence. </p>

<p>Prisoners serving very long sentences, including life sentences, are
normally reviewed on a number of occasions over a number of years before any
substantial concessions would be recommended by the Board. The final decision
as to whether a prisoner with a life sentence should be released rests with the
Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>

<p>Work-training and <a href="http://www.irishprisons.ie/index.php/prisoner-services/prison-education-service/">education</a>
are the two main activities in prison. Many prisoners voluntarily take part in
education programmes. In fact, everyone who is committed to custody is entitled
to, and encouraged to participate in the extensive educational opportunities
available.</p>

<p>The Irish prison system works in partnership with a range of educational
agencies (for example, community colleges, public libraries, Education and
Training Boards) to provide a broad programme of education. Prisoners may take
classes ranging from <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/adult_and_life_long_education/adult_literacy.html">basic
literacy</a> to <a shape="rect" href="http://www.open.ac.uk/republic-of-ireland/">Open University degrees</a>.
</p>

<p>The education curriculum includes physical education, health education,
social education (with subjects such as Home Economics) and creative activities
(art, drama, music and writing). Prisoners may also study the conventional
school subjects leading to <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/state_examinations/junior_certificate_programme.html">Junior
Certificate</a> and <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/state_examinations/established_leaving_certificate.html">Leaving
Certificate Examinations</a> and Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI)
accreditation. </p>

<p>In addition, pre-release courses on addiction, health issues and offending
behaviour are provided. The aim of the programmes is to help prisoners cope
with their sentences and prepare them for release. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/si/0252.html">Prison Rules 2007
(SI No. 252/2007)</a>, published by the Department of Justice, describe the
education and library services that prisons should try (as far is practible) to
provide for prisoners.</p>

<h3>Aim of prison education services</h3>

<p>Educational programmes in prison are aimed at helping prisoners cope with
their sentences and prepare them for release. In particular, these programmes
offer them opportunities to discover and develop new skills. Methods and
approaches used to encourage prisoners to enter these programmes are drawn from
adult and communication education. Participation in all programmes is
voluntary.</p>

<p>Teachers from <a href="http://www.etbi.ie/">Education and Training
Boards</a> teach and lecture prisoners. Other agencies contribute to prison
education such as the <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/recreational_activities_in_ireland/sport_and_leisure/public_library_services.html">Public
Library Services</a> and the Open University, which provides a wide range of
degree courses. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.artscouncil.ie/">Arts
Council</a> also provides writers' workshops, conducted by recognised writers
and artists.</p>

<h3>Objectives of prison education services</h3>

<p>Prison education has grown and developed greatly in recent years. The 50%
participation rate among Irish prisoners is very high by international
standards. The overall aims of these services are to:</p>
<ul><li>help prepare prisoners for life after release </li>
  <li>give special attention to offenders with basic education needs </li>
  <li>achieve personal development </li>
  <li>encourage the capacity for further education following release </li>
  <li>help prisoners cope with their sentences </li>
  <li>ensure harmony and teamwork between the various educational agencies and
    groups </li>
  <li>co-operate fully with other services in the prison system to promote
    Positive Sentence Management </li>

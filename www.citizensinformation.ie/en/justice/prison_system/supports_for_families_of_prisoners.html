<p>While there is no national organisation with sole responsibility for
providing information or support to families affected by imprisonment, there
are some voluntary organisations that do.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.iprt.ie/">Irish Penal Reform Trust (IPRT)</a> is a
non-governmental organisation that campaigns for the rights of prisoners. It
does not provide a service but on its website you can find a range of helpful
publications and <a href="http://www.iprt.ie/practical-information">information
for prisoners and their families</a>. It also has <a href="http://www.iprt.ie/contents/1511">contact details of organisations</a>
that provide advice and/or assistance to prisoners and former prisoners, and
their friends and families. In 2012 it published <a href="http://www.iprt.ie/contents/2450">"Picking Up the Pieces": The Rights and
Needs of Children and Families Affected by Imprisonment</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stnicholastrust.ie/">St Nicholas Trust</a> is a
Cork-based organisation that offers help and support to anybody affected by
imprisonment â€“ in particular the families of prisoners.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bedfordrow.ie/">Bedford Row Family Project</a> is based
in Limerick and supports family members affected by the imprisonment of one or
more of their family.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.casp.ie/">Clondalkin Addiction Support Programme
(CASP)</a> has produced a series of <a href="http://www.changingireland.ie/videos1.html">videos on visiting prison</a>
for families.</p>

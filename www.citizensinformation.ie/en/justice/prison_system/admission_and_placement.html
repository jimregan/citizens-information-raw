<p>There are approximately 4,000 people in custody in prisons at any one time.
There are 14 prisons and places of detention used to accommodate prisoners.
Eleven are "closed" institutions with both internal and perimeter security, one
is a semi-open place of detention which differs in that it has a reduced level
of internal security. There are a further two institutions classed as open
centres and there is a lesser emphasis on security in these centres consistent
with their aim of promoting the reintegration of prisoners into the
community.</p>

<p>The place that an offender serves their sentence in depends on a number of
different factors relating to their security status, e.g. nature of offence,
length of time served, behaviour in custody and previous offending record. In
addition, the Prison Service will take into consideration other measures such
as distance to the family home and the various rehabilitative programmes
available in the different institutions before decisions are made on the most
suitable location. The safety of prisoners is also an important consideration
and every effort is made to place prisoners in accommodation where they will be
protected from the risk of harm.</p>

<p>Section 35 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/act/pub/0010/index.html">Prisons
Act 2007</a> provides for the making of rules for the regulation and good
government of prisons. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/si/0252.html">Prison Rules 2007

<h3>Admission and placement</h3>

<p>When someone has either been convicted of a crime and sentenced to a term of
imprisonment or when a person is to be remanded in custody pending a further
court appearance, a judge will issue a warrant addressed to the Governor of one
of the committal prisons in the State. </p>

</ul><h3>Committal procedures</h3>

<p>When a person is admitted to prison custody, he or she is searched and
prohibited items and money are taken from the person and put in safe keeping
until release. When a person is searched, he or she is treated, in so far as it
is possible, with decency and self-respect and in as appropriate a manner as
possible. Prisoners are not stripped or searched in the presence of another
prisoner and female prisoners will be searched by female officers.</p>

<p>Shortly after committal, each prisoner will be examined by a medical officer
who will record his or her state of health. He or she will also be interviewed
by a prison governor who will explain the regime and entitlements. </p>

<h3>Prison transfers</h3>

<p>Decisions about transfers are made either by the Minister for Justice and
Equality or, on his or her behalf, by officials working in the Operations
Directorate of the Prison Service Headquarters. An Order of Transfer, which is
addressed to the Governor of the prison to which the person is being
transferred, will then be prepared containing the details of the sentence that
the person is serving or, where appropriate, the period on remand. The Prison
Service will make every practical effort to reduce a prisoner's exposure to
public view while being removed from or to prison.</p>

<p>As a prisoner, you have no legal right to serve your sentence in the prison
of your choice. However, you may apply to the Governor for a transfer to
another prison if you have a good reason.</p>

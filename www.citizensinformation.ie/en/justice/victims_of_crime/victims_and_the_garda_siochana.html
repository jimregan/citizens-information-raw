<p><a shape="rect" href="../law_enforcement/garda_siochana_national_police_force.html">The Gardai
(Irish police force)</a> work towards preventing crime, protecting life and
property, preserving the peace and maintaining public safety. When crimes and
offences happen, the Gardai investigate them and try to bring those responsible
to justice. </p>

<p>They do this by </p>
<ul><li>cautioning young offenders for a range of minor offences, </li>
  <li>prosecuting offenders in the District Court for less serious offences and
  </li>
  <li>reporting the results of investigations to the Director of Public
    Prosecutions and asking for direction for more serious crimes. </li>
</ul><p>The Gardai are committed to treating victims of crime with empathy,
courtesy, respect and dignity.</p>

<h3>Response</h3>

<p>If you are a victim of crime, the Gardai will respond quickly to your call.
They must give your case equal priority with other cases, whatever your gender,
race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, age, economic circumstances
or membership of any minority group.</p>

<h3>Information</h3>

<p>If you are a victim of crime, you are entitled to information from the
Gardai. The Gardai must tell you the name, telephone number and station of the
investigating Garda. The Gardai will explain the investigation process to you
and make sure that you are kept informed about the progress of the
investigation, including whether a suspect is charged or cautioned. You will
also be told about the <a shape="rect" href="victim_support.html">support
services available to victims of crime</a> .</p>

<p>If a suspect has been charged, the Gardai will</p>
<ul><li>tell you whether the accused is in <a shape="rect" href="../arrests/detention_after_arrest.html">custody</a> or on <a shape="rect" href="../arrests/bail_and_surety.html">bail</a> and the
    conditions attached to the bail </li>
  <li>tell you the time, date and location of the court hearings </li>
  <li>explain the prosecution process involved </li>
  <li>tell you if you are likely to be called as a witness </li>
  <li>if you are going to be called as a witness, tell you about the help
    available from Victim Support </li>
  <li>explain when a judge may ask for a <a href="http://www.victimsofcrimeoffice.ie/en/vco/English%20-%20Making%20a%20Victim%20Impact%20Statement.pdf/Files/English%20-%20Making%20a%20Victim%20Impact%20Statement.pdf">victim
    impact statement (pdf)</a> (for sexual and violent offences) and arrange
    for its completion </li>
  <li>tell you if you are entitled to court expenses </li>
  <li>tell you the final outcome of the trial. </li>
</ul><p>If the crime caused serious trauma to you or your family, the Gardai will
tell you if the offender is about to be released from prison, if they are
notified of the release. There is no requirement to inform the Gardaí of the
release of offenders unless a sex offenders order is in operation. They will
also make whatever policing arrangements are necessary for your safety.</p>

<h3>Sexual offences</h3>

<p>The Gardai will show special sensitivity if you are a victim of a sexual
offence. If it is appropriate, your case will be dealt with by a special Garda
unit for domestic violence and sexual assault investigation. The Gardai will
try to make sure that the Garda and the doctor who are helping you are of the
same gender.</p>

<p>You will be told about special support agencies dealing with sexual
offences. </p>

<h3>Families of murder victims</h3>

<p>If you are the family of a murder victim, a Garda superintendent will
contact you and the relevant Victim Support Service. After the initial contact,
a named member of the Garda team investigating the murder will continue to keep
you and Victim Support informed.</p>

<h3>Victims of domestic violence</h3>

<p>If you are a victim of domestic violence, you are entitled to the same Garda
support services as victims of sexual violence and serious crime. A pro-arrest
policy reflects Garda operational practice in protecting you and your family.
</p>

<h3>Victims with special needs</h3>

<p>If you are an elderly person and you have been the victim of a crime, the
Gardai will take all possible steps to protect you and your home. </p>

<p>If you are a visitor to Ireland or if you cannot speak fluent English, the
Gardai will provide a translator and will refer you to the Tourist Victim
Support service.</p>

<p>If you are a physically or mentally disabled person, the Gardai will try to
provide for your special needs.</p>

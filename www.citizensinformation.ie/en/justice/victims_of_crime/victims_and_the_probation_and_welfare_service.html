<p>As a victim, you may come into contact with the <a href="../probation_and_welfare_services/probation_service.html">Probation
Service</a>. </p>

<p>The Probation Service prepares reports for the Courts to assist judges in
determining appropriate sentences. It also prepares reports for the Parole
Board. Probation Officers also work in Prisons as well as the Children
Detentions Schools and Centres to address offending and related issues, and to
assist in the settlement of prisoners on release. </p>

<h3>Probation report</h3>

<p>The <em>probation report</em> will describe the offender, his or her family
circumstances and his or her lifestyle, including whether or not he or she is
an alcoholic or drug addict. </p>

<p>It will consider the attitude of the offender - whether he or she has
accepted responsibility for his or her actions. It will discuss whether the
offender is committed to improving his or her lifestyle or behaviour, for
example, if he or she is serious about attending a drug treatment programme.</p>

<p>The probation report will discuss whether an offender is suitable for a
non-prison sentence like community service. It may suggest conditions for a
non-prison sentence, for example, that the offender move away from an
residential area where he or she was getting into trouble.</p>

<p>In some circumstances the Probation Service may, at the request of the
judge, prepare a <span>victim impact report</span> for the Court. </p>

<p>The probation report will help the judge decide what type of <a shape="rect" href="../criminal_law/criminal_trial/sentence.html">sentence</a> to impose on
the offender. </p>

<h3>Supervision</h3>

<p>If the court decides that a non-prison sentence should be imposed, the
Probation Service may supervise the offender in his or her treatment programmes
and the community service he or she does.The Probation Services will supervise
an offender on <span>supervised release from custody</span>. </p>

a condition of a non-prison sentence, the Probation Service may organise that

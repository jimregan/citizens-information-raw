<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../prison_system/prisons_and_places_of_detention.html">prisons</a> are
managed by the Irish Prison Service. </p>

<h3>Prisons</h3>

<p>Prisons range from high-security <em>closed</em> institutions to
<em>open</em> prisons with minimum security. </p>

<p>Whether a prisoner is held in a high- or low-security prison will depend on
the prisoner's profile. Factors such as the type of offence, length of
sentence, degree of risk, etc., are taken into account. </p>

<p>If a prisoner is considered dangerous or poses a threat to you as a victim,
he or she will be held in one of the secure closed prisons.</p>

<h3>Rehabilitation</h3>

<p>One of the main aims of the prison system is to rehabilitate offenders so
that they do not offend again when they are released from prison. </p>

<p>The Prison Service provides work-training, counselling and treatment for
drug and alcohol addiction. In addition, there are special sex offenders'
treatment programmes, which force offenders to focus on the full effects of
their crimes on victims.</p>

<h3>Sentence remission</h3>

<p>Most offenders are entitled to a 25% <a shape="rect" href="../prison_system/remission_and_temporary_release.html">reduction of their
sentence</a> if they maintain good behaviour while in prison. Sentence
remission is taken into account by judges when passing sentence. </p>

<p>However, a prisoner serving a life sentence has no release date and can only
be freed with the approval of the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>

<h3>Release from prison</h3>

<p>Offenders are usually released from prison when they have finished their
sentence or when they are approved for early or <a shape="rect" href="../prison_system/remission_and_temporary_release.html">temporary
release</a> by the Minister for Justice and Equality. </p>

<p>Sex offenders released from prison must notify the Garda of their current
and any future address.</p>

<p>Temporary release is usually granted on compassionate grounds such as the
death or serious illness of a close relative. Prisoners coming to the end of
long sentences are sometimes granted temporary release to help them reintegrate
into the community. </p>

<p>When the Prison Service is deciding whether or not to grant temporary
release to a prisoner, it will take into account the potential risk or danger
to the public and to you as a victim.</p>

<h3>Parole Board</h3>

<p>The <a href="../prison_system/parole_board_of_ireland.html">Parole
Board</a> advises the Minister of Justice and Equality about the administration
of long-term prison sentences. Prisoners sentenced to 8 years or more but less
than 14 years can have their cases reviewed by the Parole Board when they have
served half of their sentence. Prisoners sentenced to 14 years or more,
including life sentences, will have their case reviewed after 7 years in
custody.</p>

<p>The Parole Board can only make recommendations. The final decision lies with
the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The Prison Service will:</p>
<ul><li>Try to rehabilitate and reform all offenders sentenced to prison</li>
  <li>Provide enough prison spaces so that all offenders sentenced to
    imprisonment can serve out their sentences. </li>
  <li>When temporary release is being considered, take into account any
    potential risk to you as a victim and the contents of the victim impact
    statement.</li>
  <li>Make sure that no extra distress is caused to you by any action of the
    offender while he or she is in prison</li>
</ul><p>If you are the victim of a serious sexual or violent offence and you have
requested that you be told if the offender is being released, the Prison
Service will notify the Gardai prior to his or her release.</p>

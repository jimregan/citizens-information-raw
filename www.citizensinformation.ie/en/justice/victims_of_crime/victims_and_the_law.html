</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>The Criminal Evidence Act, 1992</h3>

<p>This Act makes it easier for witnesses to give evidence in physical or
sexual abuse cases by allowing for a live television link with the court. In
some cases, this Act forces the spouse of the accused to give evidence for the
prosecution.</p>

<p>The Act makes it easier for children to give evidence by getting rid of</p>
<ul><li>the need to give evidence on oath </li>
  <li>the need for corroboration (previously, additional evidence confirming
    the evidence given by the child was needed) </li>
  <li>the wearing of wigs and gowns by barristers when evidence is being given
    by television links. </li>
</ul><h3>The Criminal Justice Act, 1993</h3>

<p>This Act forces the court to consider the effect of a violent or sexual
offence on you when it is deciding the <a shape="rect" href="../criminal_law/criminal_trial/sentence.html">sentence</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a victim of a violent or sexual offence, you are also entitled to
give evidence in court about how the crime affected you.</p>

<p>The Act allows the Director of Public Prosecutions to appeal lenient
sentences and gives the court the power to force the offender to pay
compensation to you for any personal injury or loss you suffered.</p>

<h3>The Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995</h3>

<p>Under this Act, the <a href="../legal_aid_and_advice/legal_aid_board.html">Legal Aid Board</a>
provides legal aid or advice to a <em>complainant</em> in certain criminal
cases involving prosecution for a range of sexual offences, including rape,
aggravated sexual assault and incest. A complainant is the person making the
complaint.</p>

<p>The Board also provides legal advice in relation to criminal matters to
alleged victims of human trafficking.</p>

<h3>The Domestic Violence Act, 1997</h3>

<p>This Act provides protection where there is a violent family member. There
are <a href="../../birth_family_relationships/problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/barring_safety_and_protection_orders.html">two
main kinds of protection</a> available, a safety order and a barring order.</p>

<p>A safety order prohibits the violent person from further violence or threats
of violence. It does not oblige the person to leave the family home. If the
person lives apart from you it prohibits them from watching or being near your
home.</p>

<p>A barring order requires the violent person to leave the family home. The
order also prohibits the person from further violence or threats of violence,
and from watching or being near your home.</p>

<h3>Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997</h3>

<p>This Act has updated and modernised the existing law relating to various
forms of assault, threats to kill or cause serious harm, poisoning, false
imprisonment and abduction of children. The Act has also introduced a number of
new offences. The Act has measures dealing with</p>
<ul><li>Assaults </li>
  <li>Offences relating to violence or threats of violence involving syringes
    and/or blood </li>
  <li>The offence of harassment, which is aimed at what is commonly known as
    "stalking" </li>
  <li>Debt collection with threats or menaces </li>
  <li>Coercion </li>
  <li>Endangerment </li>
  <li>Poisoning or the administration of substances intended to interfere with
    bodily functions </li>
  <li>The use of reasonable force in protecting yourself, your family and your
    property from criminal activity. </li>
</ul><h3>The Bail Act, 1997</h3>

<p>This Act tightened up the <a shape="rect" href="../arrests/bail_and_surety.html">bail</a> regime.</p>

<p>Now a court may refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence if it
is likely that the person may commit another serious offence while he or she is
on bail. In addition, the Act requires a court to impose consecutive sentences
when an offence is committed on bail </p>

<h3>The Criminal Justice Act, 1999</h3>

<p>This Act deals with the protection of witnesses, including victims, who may
have to give evidence in court. </p>

<p>It allows witnesses who are in fear or subject to intimidation to give
evidence by a live television link:</p>

<p>It creates some new offences, including intimidation of a witness, a jury
member or any person helping the Gardai with a criminal investigation. The
penalty is up to 10 years imprisonment.</p>

<h3>The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 </h3>

<p>This Act makes it an offence to <a href="../crime_and_crime_prevention/anti_human_trafficking_initiative.html">traffick
in adults or children</a> for the purpose of their sexual or labour
exploitation or the removal of their organs. In addition, it makes it an
offence to sell or purchase (or offer to sell or purchase) any person for any
purpose. It is also an offence to solicit or importune a trafficked person for
the purpose of prostitution.</p>

<h3>The Criminal Law (Defence and the Dwelling) Act 2011</h3>

<p>This law provides that people are entitled to use reasonable force in
defence of people and property if they believe that an intruder has entered
their dwelling to commit a criminal act.</p>

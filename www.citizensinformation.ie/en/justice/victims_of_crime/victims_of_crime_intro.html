<h3>Victims' Directive</h3>

<p>On 16 November 2015 <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1448897836346&amp;uri=CELEX:32012L0029">Directive
2012/29/EU</a> establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and
protection of victims of crime (known as the Victims’ Directive) came into
force. The aim of the Directive is to ensure that victims of crime receive
appropriate information, support and protection and are able to participate in
criminal proceedings.</p>

<p>It provides for information to be given to victims from first contact with
the criminal justice agencies and for much additional information to be given
in the course of the investigation and court process if the victim opts to
receive that information. It also provides among other things that victims of
crime are able to:</p>
<ul><li>Receive an individual assessment to identify their specific protection
    needs</li>
  <li>Access victim support services</li>
  <li>Access protection</li>
  <li>Enjoy safeguards in the context of restorative justice services</li>
  <li>Enjoy privacy in the context of the criminal proceedings</li>
</ul><p>A <a href="http://www.eujusticia.net/images/uploads/pdf/KYR_Victims_Directive_single_page.pdf">guide

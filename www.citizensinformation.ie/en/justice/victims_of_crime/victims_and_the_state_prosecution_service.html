<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>If you are a victim of crime, you may be concerned about whether the crime
will be prosecuted and whether the perpetrator will be brought to justice.</p>

<p>The State Prosecution Service is a service provided by the <a href="https://www.dppireland.ie/">Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions
(DPP)</a>. The Chief Prosecution Solicitor acts as solicitor to the DPP.
Prosecution solicitors represent the DPP in all courts in Dublin while local
State solicitors represent the DPP in courts outside Dublin.</p>

<p>The Director of Public Prosecutions enforces the criminal law in the courts
on behalf of the people of Ireland, directs and supervises public prosecutions
on indictment in the courts, and gives general direction and advice to the
Garda Síochána in relation to summary cases and specific direction in such
cases where requested.</p>

<p>The DPP's Office is totally independent – the Government cannot order the
DPP to prosecute or not to prosecute any particular case.</p>

<p>Although nearly all prosecutions are formally taken in the name of the DPP,
the decision about whether to prosecute in most cases is actually made by the
Gardaí. However, the decision to prosecute in the most serious cases (for
example, murder, sexual offences) is made only by the DPP.</p>

<p>Information on <a href="http://www.dppireland.ie/victims_and_witnesses/the-decision-to-prosecute/">how
decisions are made</a> is available in the DPP’s publication, <a href="http://www.dppireland.ie/filestore/documents/GUIDELINES_-_Revised_NOV_2010_eng.pdf">Guidelines
for Prosecutors (pdf)</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lab7c6">Prosecution</h2>

<p>If the DPP decides to prosecute, the prosecution solicitor (in all courts in
Dublin) or the local State solicitors (in courts outside Dublin) work with
victims in the following ways:</p>
<ul><li>They work with the Garda Síochána to ensure that the victim is kept
    informed of developments in relation to the prosecution especially those of
    a violent or sexual nature</li>
  <li>At the victim’s request, they facilitate a pre-trial meeting between
    the victim and the solicitor and barrister (counsel) dealing with the case
    to discuss the case. The purpose of this meeting is to explain the trial
    process to the victim. They do not discuss evidence with witnesses in
    advance of a case.</li>
</ul><p>When a court has found a person guilty, it will decide on the sentence. If
the DPP considers the court sentence to be too lenient, it may appeal the
sentence to the Court of Appeal. The DPP cannot appeal against a sentence given
in the District Court.</p>

<p>Further information on <a href="http://www.dppireland.ie/brief-guide-to-the-criminal-justice-system/category/5/">victims
of crime and court cases</a> is available on the DPP website.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l4b039">Decision not to prosecute</h2>

<p>If the DPP decides not to prosecute in a particular case, the reasons are
given to the investigating Gardaí and are kept confidential.</p>

<h3>Reasons for decision</h3>

<p>The DPP and his staff do not meet the victims to discuss decisions. However,
a victim can ask the DPP for a summary of the reasons for the decision not to
prosecute. This applies to all decisions made since 16 November 2015. A family
member of the victim in a fatal case can ask for a summary of the reasons for
the decision not to prosecute.</p>

<p>You must make your request within 28 days of the date you are told of the
decision not to prosecute.</p>

<p>If the decision not to prosecute was made by the Gardaí, a victim can ask
the Gardaí for a summary of the reasons for the decision.</p>

<h3>Review of decision</h3>

<p>A victim, a family member of the victim in a fatal case or a solicitor
acting on their behalf can request a review of a decision. If you have
requested a summary of the reasons for the decision not to prosecute, you must
make your request for a review within 28 days of the date on the letter telling
you of the reasons. If you have not asked for the reasons for the decision, you
must make your request for a review within 56 days (8 weeks) of the date you
are told of the decision not to prosecute.</p>

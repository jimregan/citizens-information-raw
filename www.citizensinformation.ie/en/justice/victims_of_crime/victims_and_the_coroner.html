<p>When a person dies in sudden, unexplained, violent or unnatural
circumstances in Ireland, there will be an enquiry into the death. The "<a shape="rect" href="/en/death/sudden_or_unexplained_death/coroners.html">coroner</a>" who is
either a qualified doctor or a lawyer conducts the enquiry.</p>

<p>A post-mortem examination may be necessary, which may be followed by an "<a shape="rect" href="/en/death/sudden_or_unexplained_death/inquests.html">inquest</a>". If a
death is due to unnatural causes, then by law, an inquest must be held.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Identification</h3>

<p>Arrangements that will not cause any unnecessary stress to family members
should be made for the identification of the deceased person. Sometimes
arrangements will be made for an alternative person to carry out the
identification.</p>

<h3>Post-mortem</h3>

<p>Post-mortems may be carried out following a death in certain circumstances.
Information about the post-mortem procedure will be made available to the
family of the deceased by the coroner's office. If they have requested it, the
findings of the examination will be made known to the family.</p>

<h3>Release for burial</h3>

<p>The coroner will try to ensure that the body of the deceased is released
without any undue delay and the family will be informed about the likely date
and time of the release of the body.</p>

<h3>Inquests</h3>

<p>An inquest is an inquiry held in public by a coroner, sometimes with a jury.
The inquest looks into the circumstances surrounding the death. It's purpose is
to establish the facts surrounding the death and to place those facts on the
public record. It also makes findings on the identification of the deceased,
the date and place of death and the cause of death.</p>

<p>The family will be informed of the date, time and place of the inquest as
soon as possible. </p>

<p>The coroner or the jury may make a general recommendation designed to
prevent similar deaths but the Coroner's Court cannot decide who is to blame
for the death. </p>

<p>The enquiry into a death can often involve upset and trauma for relatives
and families. Coroners should make sure that each stage of their work is
carried out with sensitivity and respect for both the deceased and the grieving
families.</p>

<p>After the inquest, the coroner will, if requested, make copies of documents
available to the families for a fee.</p>

<h3>Civil legal aid </h3>

<p>At present there is no legislation providing you with an entitlement to
civil legal aid in the Coroner's Court. However, a small number of ex-gratia,
discretionary payments for legal representation at inquests have been made to
families or next of kin of people who died in state care or custody or where
the state was directly involved. </p>

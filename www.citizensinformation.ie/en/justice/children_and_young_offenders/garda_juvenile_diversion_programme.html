<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Children
Act 2001</a> formally established Ireland’s Juvenile Diversion Programme. The
aim of this programme is to prevent young offenders in Ireland from entering
into the full criminal justice system by offering them a second chance. The
intended outcome of the Programme is to divert young people from committing
further offences. Where a young person comes to the notice of the Garda
Síochána because of their criminal activity, they may be dealt with through
the Diversion Programme.</p>

<p>The Programme facilitates young people who are under 17 years of age but can
be extended to those under 18 years of age. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/sec0017.html#partiv-sec17">Sections
17–51 of the Children Act 2001</a> set out the role and remit of the Juvenile
Diversion Programme. Sections 123–127 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0026/index.html">Criminal
Justice Act 2006</a> amended the 2001 Act in March 2007 to allow the programme
cater for children who accept responsibility for their anti-social behaviour.
While the 2006 Act raised the age of criminal responsibility to 12 years of age
it also allowed the programme to cater for children aged 10 or 11 years.</p>

<p>The current diversion programme evolved from an informal scheme which had
operated on a non-statutory basis since the early 1960’s. That scheme allowed
the gardaí to deal informally with people under 18 years of age who had
committed criminal offences. The purpose of the original scheme was to prevent
young offenders from entering into the courts system and incurring a criminal
record.</p>

<p>The Juvenile Diversion Programme is administered by specially trained
gardaí called Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers (JLO). These gardaí are
specially trained to deal with young people and their families in relation to
crime-prevention, the operation of the diversion programme and all other areas
involving young people and the criminal justice system. Each Garda District in
Ireland has a juvenile liaison office and it is their responsibility to
maintain informal contacts with young people at risk and to liaise with
teachers, Child and Family Agency staff, school attendance officers and other
gardaí in their local area.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="ld598b">How the programme works</h2>

<h3>Who has responsibility for the Juvenile Diversion Programme?</h3>

<p>Overall responsibility for the operation of the Juvenile Diversion Programme
lies with the National Juvenile Office. This is part of the Community Relations
Section of the Garda Síochána which is located in Dublin. The Office was
established in 1991. The Garda National Juvenile Office is also responsible for
liaising with voluntary and statutory bodies regarding the welfare of young
people, developing contacts with school attendance officers, formulating
crime-prevention programmes for juveniles at risk and recording and examining
cases of juveniles missing from home.</p>

<h3>How does the diversion programme work?</h3>

<p>The idea behind the Juvenile Diversion Programme is to allow for young
people who commit criminal offences to be dealt with by means of a
<em>caution</em> instead of the formal process of charge and prosecution. A
caution is a warning by the Garda Siochána against committing certain types of
behaviour.</p>

<p>The child, where appropriate, is placed under the supervision of a JLO.</p>

<p>The programme allows for a conference(s) to be held which can mediate
between the child and the victim, if appropriate, and draw up an action plan
for the child.</p>

<h3>Who decides whether a child should be admitted to the programme? </h3>

<p>In advance of admission to the programme, a JLO is assigned to assess the
suitability of the young person for inclusion in the programme. Before the
young person is considered for admission, he/she must admit involvement in the
offence. Following this assessment, a decision is then made as to whether or
not to administer a caution.</p>

<p>It’s important to note, the final decision as to whether or not a young
person is cautioned lies not with the Garda Síochána, but instead with the
Director of the National Juvenile Office. In cases, however, which involve
serious crime, consent to issue a caution must first be obtained from the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dppireland.ie/">Director of Public
Prosecutions</a>. If the Director of Public Prosecutions decides a young person
is not to be included in the Juvenile Diversion Programme because of the
serious nature of the crime then, the young person is dealt with through the
criminal justice system by way of charge and prosecution.</p>

<p>In carrying out an assessment for admission to the programme, the JLO
consults with the young person’s parents or guardians and may also consult
with the victim. While the consent of the victim is not required for a caution
to be made, the consent of the parent or guardian is normally required.</p>

<h3>What conditions must be met for admission to the programme?</h3>

<p>The Director of the National Juvenile Office decides whether or not a child
is to be admitted to the programme once the preconditions have been met, except
in cases of serious offences where the decision lies with the Director of
Public Prosecutions as mentioned previously. </p>

<p>There are three basic criteria laid down which must be satisfied in order to
be eligible for admission to the programme:</p>
<ul><li>The child must accept responsibility for his or her criminal behaviour.
  </li>
  <li>The child must consent to be cautioned and where appropriate, to be
    supervised by a juvenile liaison officer. </li>
  <li>The child must be of or over <a shape="rect" href="children_and_the_criminal_justice_system_in_ireland.html">the age of
    criminal responsibility</a> and under 18 years of age. Under the Criminal
    Justice Act 2006 children aged 10 or 11 are eligible for the programme.
  </li>
</ul><p>The Director is obliged to direct a JLO to give notice in writing to the
parents or guardian of a child who is admitted to the programme. This notice
includes the type of criminal behaviour in respect of which a caution is to be
given. It also states whether or not the caution is to be formal or informal.
The parents or guardians are obliged to attend the cautioning process. </p>

<p>While the notice is to be given in writing the Director ensures the notice
is given in language which can be understood by the parents or guardians and
this may mean that the notice be given in the mother tongue of the parents or
guardian. The notice shall also be available in Irish for children from
Gaeltacht areas or whose first language is Irish.</p>

<h3>Is there any protection for children participating in the programme?</h3>

<p>Any child who has been admitted to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme is
protected from prosecution for the criminal behaviour which resulted in his/her
admission to the programme. Any acceptance by the child of responsibility for
their criminal behaviour in respect of which they have been admitted to the
programme will not be available in any civil or criminal proceedings against
that child. However, under Section 126 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, it may
be used where a court is considering the sentence to be imposed in respect of
an offence committed after admission to the programme.</p>

<p>The identity of any child who is either admitted to or considered for
admission to the programme is not disclosed publicly. Any person who publishes
or broadcasts such information is guilty of an offence.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l43028">Cautions</h2>

<h3>Are there different types of caution?</h3>

<p>Two types of caution may be given; formal or informal. The decision as to
whether to administer a formal or informal caution is made by the Director of
the Programme and will depend on the seriousness of the child’s criminal
behaviour.</p>

<h3>How is a formal caution delivered?</h3>

<p>The formal caution is given by a Garda inspector or more senior. Those
present when the caution is delivered must include the child, the child’s
parents or guardian and a JLO. The Director of the Programme may also invite
the victim of the crime to attend.</p>

<p>There is no specific format (that is, wording or procedure) for
administering the caution. The officer who gives the caution, however, normally
discusses the criminal behaviour and highlights to the child the seriousness of
his/her actions. The child may be invited to apologise to the victim and where
appropriate to make financial or other reparation to the victim. The formal
caution normally takes place in a Garda Station to highlight the seriousness of
the situation to the child.</p>

<h3>How is an informal caution delivered?</h3>

<p>The informal caution given for less serious criminal behaviour may be given
at the child’s home or in a Garda station. It is administered by a JLO. The
only persons obliged to attend while the caution is being given are the parents
or guardian of the child. There are no provisions for attendance of anybody
other than the parents or guardians and the child.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l85068">Supervision</h2>

<h3>Who decides on the level of supervision?</h3>

<p>Every child who receives a formal caution through the Garda Diversion
Programme is placed under the supervision of a JLO for twelve months. The level
of supervision is normally a matter decided by the JLO.</p>

28(2) of the Children Act 2001</a> sets out the various matters which must be
considered in deciding the appropriate level of supervision. These include
the:</p>

<p>• Seriousness of the child’s behaviour </p>

<p>• Level of support given to, and the level of control of, the child by the
parents or guardian</p>

<p>• Likelihood of the child committing further offences</p>

<p>• Directions from the Director regarding the appropriate level of
supervision.</p>

<h3>What does the supervision involve?</h3>

<p>Supervision normally involves the JLO being pro-active in relation to the
child’s behaviour. It won’t normally involve the child reporting to the JLO
at specified times and allows the child the opportunity to return to his/her
normal routine, without the intrusion of being forced to attend meetings on a
regular basis.</p>

<p>It is important, however, for the child to realise his/her behaviour is
being monitored for the period of supervision.</p>

<p>Supervision does not normally result from an informal caution. Only in
exceptional circumstances does a supervision period of six months apply after
an informal caution.</p>

<h3>What is a Juvenile Diversion Programme Conference?</h3>

<p>A key part of the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme is the facility to hold
a meeting (or conference) to discuss the welfare of a child admitted to the
programme. These conferences are established in law through <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/sec0029.html">Section
29 of the Children Act 2001</a>.</p>

<p>The conference may mediate between the child and the victim (where
appropriate) in accordance with the terms of the programme. Conferences also
formulate an action plan for the child. They must uphold the concerns of the
victim and have due regard to his or her interests. </p>

<h2>Juvenile Diversion Programme Conference</h2>

<p>A key part of the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme is the Juvenile
Diversion Programme Conference. More than one conference may be held for a
child. The purpose of the conference is:</p>
<ul><li>To discuss the welfare of a child admitted to the Diversion Programme
  </li>
  <li>To mediate between the child and the victim (where appropriate) in
    accordance with the terms of the diversion programme </li>
  <li>To formulate an action plan for the child </li>
  <li>To uphold the concerns of the victim and to have due regard to his or her
    interests </li>
</ul><p>This involves:</p>
<ul><li>Establishing why the child became involved in the behaviour that gave
    rise to their admission to the programme </li>
  <li>Discussing how the parents/ guardian, family members, relatives or other
    people could help prevent the child from becoming involved in further such
    behaviour </li>
  <li>Where appropriate, reviewing the child’s behaviour since his/her
    admission to the programme </li>
</ul><h3>Who decides to convene the conference? </h3>

<p>The decision to hold a conference lies with the Director of the National
Juvenile Office. Before the Director makes a decision, the Juvenile Liaison
Officer (JLO) appointed to supervise a child under the programme recommends in
writing that a conference is held. The child’s parents/ guardian must agree
to the conference before it can be held. The consent of the child is not
required but his/her views must be obtained on the matter. </p>

<p>If the Director decides to hold a conference they must appoint someone to
convene and chair the conference. This person is known as the facilitator and
they must be either the supervising JLO or another Garda. </p>

<h3>Who attends the conference? </h3>

<p>The child, their parents/guardian and a Garda facilitator attend the
conference. Other family members and relatives may also attend, if this is
appropriate. The facilitator may also invite other people who the facilitator
feels would make a positive contribution to the conference, such as,
representatives from the Child and Family Agency, the Probation Service and the
child’s school. </p>

<p>The victim is invited to the conference and any family or friends of the
victim that the victim requests, unless the facilitator believes their
attendance would not contribute to the conference </p>

<h3>What does the conference consider? </h3>

<p>The conference is obliged to consider the appropriate level of supervision
of the child and whether it should be varied. Normally a conference only occurs
if the supervision of the child is not having the desired effect and the
child’s behaviour isn’t improving. </p>

<p>When a conference is called, an action plan is normally agreed for the
child. The action plan must be agreed by all those present at the conference.
An action plan is not a compulsory function of the conference but it is a
normal outcome of the conference. </p>

<h3>What does the action plan cover? </h3>

<p>Some of the items an action plan may cover include:</p>
<ul><li>An apology (verbally or in writing or both) by the child to the victim
  </li>
  <li>Financial or other reparation to any victim </li>
  <li>Participation by the child in a suitable sporting or recreational
    activity </li>
  <li>Attendance by the child at school or a place of work </li>
  <li>Participation by the child in a suitable training, educational course or
    a programme that does not interfere with any work or school schedule of the
    child </li>
  <li>The child being at home at certain times </li>
  <li>The child staying away from specific places or people (or both) </li>
  <li>Initiatives within the child’s family and community that might help to
    prevent the child committing further offences </li>
  <li>Any other matter (which in the opinion of those present at the
    conference) would be in the child’s best interests or would make the
    child more aware of the consequences of his/her criminal behaviour. </li>
</ul><p>Once an action plan is agreed, the plan comes into operation on the date on
which it is signed by the Garda facilitator, the child (if possible) and one
other person present. The action plan is reviewed at any time within six months
from the date the plan is signed. The details of the conference and any action
plan must be reported to the Director of the National Juvenile Office. </p>

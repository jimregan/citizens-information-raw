<h3>Garda Youth Diversion Projects</h3>

<p>Garda Youth Diversion Projects are administered by the Community Programmes
Unit of the Irish Youth Justice Service in cooperation with the Garda Office
for Children and Youth Affairs. Projects are community based, multi-agency
youth crime prevention initiatives which primarily seek to divert young people
who have been involved in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour.</p>

<p>The projects provide the children with opportunities to engage in activities
such as education, employment training, sport, art and music. Most projects
operate outside of school hours, although activities may also be planned during
the daytime.</p>

<p>There are approximately 100 projects and they are managed by community based
organisations. In general, each project is staffed by two youth justice
workers. New Operational Requirements were put in place in January 2011,
replacing the 2003 Garda Youth Diversion Project Guidelines and provide a
governance framework. Projects are funded by the Department of Justice and
Equality.</p>

<p>The Irish Youth Justice Service has published a <a href="http://www.iyjs.ie/en/IYJS/Progress%20Report%20Template%20FINAL%2014-1-13.pdf/Files/Progress%20Report%20Template%20FINAL%2014-1-13.pdf">Progress
Report on Garda Youth Diversion Project Development (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Schools Programme </h3>

<p>At school level, the Gardaí operate a programme which is designed to
discourage young people from involving themselves in criminal behaviour. This
programme is called the Schools Programme. The programme involves Gardaí
visiting classrooms and undertaking projects and trips with pupils in 5th class
in <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_primary_school/primary_education_life_event.html">primary
schools</a>. A programme for <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_post_primary_school/post_primary_education_life_event.html">post-primary
schools</a> has been developed to run in conjunction with the <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_post_primary_school/junior_cycle.html">Social,
Personal and Health Education syllabus for Junior Cycle</a>. </p>

<p>As well as making young people aware of the dangers of criminal behaviour,
the Schools Programme also shows children the positive side of the work of the
Gardaí and encourages good relations between pupils and the Gardaí.</p>

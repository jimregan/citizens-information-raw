<p>Detention of a child who is convicted of a crime is considered a last
resort. As an alternative to detention, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Children
Act 2001</a> provides for a range of community sanctions that can be imposed by
a court. The court must consider that a community sanction is the most suitable
way of dealing with the case.</p>

<p>These sanctions allow a child to remain in the community and stay at school.
The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.probation.ie/EN/PB/WebPages/WP16000038">Young Persons
Probation division of the Probation Service</a> oversees the implementation of
most of the community sanctions. </p>

<p>If a child does not comply with a community sanction that has been imposed
the case is returned to the court.</p>

<p>Apart from a community service order, all community sanction orders expire 6
months after the child has reached 18 years of age, if they have not already
done so. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l37d93">Community sanctions</h2>

<p>There are 10 community sanctions available to the courts.</p>

<h3>Community service order</h3>

<p>Under a community service order a child aged 16 or 17 completes a set number
of hours of unpaid work. The number of hours can range from 40 – 240 hours.
</p>

<h3>Day centre order</h3>

<p>A day centre order requires a child to attend a day centre and participate
in a programme of activities. Attendance at the centre is for a maximum of 90
days. The days need not be consecutive, but attendance cannot exceed a period
of 6 months. </p>

<p>Generally, the programme is available in the evenings and on weekends so as
not to interfere with school, training or employment. </p>

<h3>Probation order</h3>

<p>A probation order places a child under the supervision of the Probation
Service for a period of time. During the period the child must meet certain
conditions that are set by the court. Standard conditions include:</p>
<ul><li>To be of good behaviour</li>
  <li>To follow the instructions of the supervising probation officer</li>
</ul><p>Additional conditions may include paticipation in a training course or
activity and residence in a hostel. </p>

<h3>Training or activities programme order</h3>

<p>This is a type of probation order where the child has to complete a
programme of training or activity recommended by a probation officer. The
programme may be managed by the Probation Service or some other body. It does
not necessarily cater exclusively for children found guilty of offences. </p>

<h3>Intensive supervision order</h3>

<p>Under an intensive supervision order a child is placed under the close
supervision of a probation officer. During the period of the order the child is
required to live at a specified residence and attend a programme of education,
training or treatment. The order cannot exceed 180 days. If the order is over
90 days it is subject to review after 60 days. </p>

<p>The programme may be managed by the Probation Service or some other body. It
does not necessarily cater exclusively for children found guilty of offences.
</p>

<h3>Residential supervision order</h3>

<p>A court can order that a child lives in a hostel. The hostel would be
reasonably close to where the child usually lives or to where they go to
school, work or attend training. The period of the order cannot exceed one
year.</p>

<h3>Suitable person (care and supervision) order</h3>

<p>Under a suitable person order the court places a child into the care of a
suitable adult. The suitable person can be a relative. The child’s parents
must give their consent in writing. The period of the order cannot exceed 2
years. </p>

<h3>Mentor (family support) order</h3>

<p>A court can assign someone, a mentor, to help, advise and support the child
and the child’s family in the family’s efforts to try and stop the child
from committing further offences. The mentor also monitors the child’s
behaviour generally.</p>

<p>The child and the parents must give their consent and the period of the
order cannot not exceed 2 years.</p>

<h3>Restriction on movement order</h3>

<p>A restriction on movement order is a curfew order supervised by the Gardaí.
The child is required to be at a certain address between 7pm and 6am. The
maximum period of time the curfew can be imposed for is 6 months. </p>

<p>Instead of the curfew or as well as the curfew, the order can include a
condition to stay away from a specified area. The maximum period of time for
this condition is 12 months. </p>

<h3>Dual order</h3>

<p>A dual order combines a restriction of movement order with either a day
centre order or a probation order. The child’s movements are restricted for a
maximum of 6 months. At the same time, the child attends a day centre for a
maximum of 90 days or is under the supervision of a probation officer. </p>

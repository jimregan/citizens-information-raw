<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>For the purpose of criminal law a child is anyone under 18 years of age.
Children who have not reached the age of 12 years cannot be charged with an
offence, with the exception of children aged 10 or 11 who may be charged with
certain serious offences. During the court proceedings of a <a href="children_and_the_criminal_justice_system_in_ireland.html">child
charged with an offence</a>, the court may order that a family conference be
held.</p>

<p>A family conference is a meeting involving the child charged with the
offence, members of the child’s family, the victim(s) and other relevant
people. At the meeting, the offence is discussed with regard to its effect on
the victim, the community and on the child’s family. It aims to come up with
a plan which will help the child to avoid getting into trouble in the
future.</p>

<h3>Court proceedings</h3>

<p>The hearings for all minor offences are held in the <a href="../courts_system/children_court.html">Children Court</a>, as are most
serious (indictable) offences. The court may, during the child’s court
proceedings, direct that a family conference be convened. The <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_2001_0024.HTM">Children
Acts 2001–2015</a> make provision for the court to ask the <a href="../probation_and_welfare_services/probation_service.html">Probation
Service</a> to convene such a family conference. The court then adjourns the
court proceedings until after the conference is held. The court may direct the
conference to consider certain matters relating to the child.</p>

<p>The Court orders a family conference when:</p>
<ul><li>The child accepts responsibility for his/her criminal behaviour</li>
  <li>The court believes that an action plan should be devised</li>
  <li>The child and the child’s parents or guardians agree to participate in
    the conference</li>
</ul><h3>Conference meeting</h3>

<p>A probation officer arranges the family conference within 28 days of being
requested to do so by the court. The child and the child’s family attend the
meeting. The victim may attend. Other relevant people may also attend, such as
a teacher or social worker.</p>

<p>At the meeting the child’s offence is discussed with regard to its effect
on the victim, the community and on the child’s family. It looks at ways that
the child can take responsibility for his/her behaviour and make good the harm
done. It is based on the principles of restorative justice.</p>

<p>At some stage during the meeting, the child and his/her family meet
privately to draft an action plan that is designed to make amends and to help
the child stay out of trouble. The draft action plan is then discussed by the
full group at the meeting and agreed.</p>

<h3>Action plan</h3>

<p>The agreed action plan is submitted to court for approval. If the court
approves the plan it is overseen by the child’s family, other identified
individuals and it is supervised by the probation officer.</p>

<p>When the action plan has been completed, the case is returned to court for a
final decision. If the action plan is not completed the court can deal with the
case in some other way, for example <a href="detention_of_children_and_young_people.html">detention</a> or <a href="community_sanctions.html">community sanctions</a>.</p>

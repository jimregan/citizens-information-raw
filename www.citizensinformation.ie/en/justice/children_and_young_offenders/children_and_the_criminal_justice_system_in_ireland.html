<p>Children are among the most vulnerable members of society. The law of the
state protects children until they are deemed to be able to interact in society
as adults. For this reason children are treated differently from adults by the
criminal justice system. The law which deals with children found in breach of
the criminal law is contained in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Children
Act, 2001</a> which was amended by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0026/index.html">Criminal
Justice Act 2006</a>, the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/45/enacted/en/print.html">Children
(Amendment) Act 2015</a> and other acts. </p>

<p>The Children Act 2001 Act became law in July 2001 and since then most of the
provisions of the 2001 Act and the amendments have been brought into force. The
2001 legislation is based on the philosophy that children in conflict with the
law should only be detained (custody) by the state as a last resort. There are
many community based measures which must be explored and exhausted before
detention can be considered.</p>

<p>There were three Departments of the Government with the responsibility for
overseeing the implementation of the Children Act, 2001. These were as
follows:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.justice.ie/">Department of Justice and
    Equality</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.education.ie/en/">Department of
    Education and Skills</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://health.gov.ie/">Department of Health</a>
  </li>
</ul><p>The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs was set up in
December 2005 to bring greater coherence to policy-making for children. While
it was part of the Department of Health it also included units from the two
other departments, such as the Irish Youth Justice Service.</p>

<p>The Irish Youth Justice Service was established in December 2005 within the
Department of Justice and Equality. The Service brought together all of the
State's youth justice services in one place. It provided strategic direction to
the development of services and promote necessary reforms.</p>

<p>In June 2011, the <a href="https://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=120">Department of Children and
Youth Affairs</a> was established. It took over the functions of the Office of
the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. Certain units from other
departments also became part of the new Department, such as the Irish Youth
Justice Service.</p>

<h3>Definition of a child in criminal law</h3>

<p>Until the introduction of the Children Act 2001 many expressions were used
to identify someone within the scope of the juvenile justice system.
Expressions such as minor, juvenile, youth offender and young person were
commonplace. However, the word child is now defined by <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/sec0003.html#parti-sec3">Section
3 of the 2001 Act</a> to mean a person under the age of 18 years.</p>

<p>The Children Act 2001 does not distinguish between a child and a young
person. Any provisions in earlier Acts distinguishing different classes of
children (for example, young persons, minors, child) no longer exist.</p>

<h3>Age of criminal responsibility</h3>

<p>The age of criminal responsibility is covered by <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/sec0052.html#partv-sec52">Section
52 of the Children Act 2001</a> as amended by Section 129 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2006/act/26/enacted/en/html">Criminal
Justice Act 2006</a>. This came into effect in October 2006, raising the age of
criminal responsibility from 7 years of age to 12 years of age. This means that
children who have not reached the age of 12 years cannot be charged with an
offence. There is an exception, however, for children aged 10 or 11 who can be
charged with murder, manslaughter, rape or aggravated sexual assault. In
addition, where a child under 14 years of age is charged with an offence, no
further proceedings can be taken without the consent of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dppireland.ie/">Director of Public Prosecutions</a>.</p>

<p>Although the 2001 Act in general prohibits children under 12 years of age
from being charged and convicted of a criminal offence, they do not enjoy total
immunity from action being taken against them. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/sec0053.html">Section
53 of the Act</a> as amended by Section 130 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006
places an onus on the Gardai to take a child under 12 years of age to his/her
parents or guardian, where they have reasonable grounds for believing that the
child has committed an offence with which the child cannot be charged due to
the child’s age. Where this is not possible the Gardai will arrange for the
child to be taken into the custody of the <a shape="rect" href="../../birth_family_relationships/family_support_agency.html">Child and
Family Agency (Tusla)</a> for the area in which the child normally resides. It
is possible that children under 12 years of age who commit criminal offences
will be dealt with by Tusla and not the criminal justice system.</p>

<h3>Detention of a child</h3>

<p>Under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/sec0142.html#partix-sec142">Section
142 of the Children Act 2001</a>, a court may impose a period of detention on a
child. Children between the ages of 10 and 16 sentenced by the courts to a
period of detention are sent to the <a href="https://www.oberstown.com/">Oberstown Children Detention Campus</a>.
17-year-olds sentenced after 31 March 2017 are also sent to the Oberstown
Children Detention Campus. You can find out more in our document on the <a shape="rect" href="detention_of_children_and_young_people.html">detention of
children</a>.</p>

<h3>Spent convictions</h3>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/sec0258.html#sec258">Section
258 of the Children Act 2001</a> an offence committed by a child under the age
of 18, for which they have been found guilty, can be automatically expunged
from the record as if never committed, once certain conditions are met. The
conditions are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>The offence was committed before the child reached the age of 18
  years</li>
  <li>The offence is not one required to be tried by the Central Criminal Court
    (such as murder or rape)</li>
  <li>At least 3 years have elapsed since the finding of guilt and</li>
  <li>The child has not been dealt with for another offence in that 3-year
    period</li>
</ul><p>If these conditions are met, they are no longer regarded under Irish law as
having committed an offence. If they have received a caution or have been dealt
with under the Probation of Offenders Act 1907, Section 258 also applies.</p>

<p>When looking for employment or applying for an educational course or
insurance, they can claim to have a clean record. However, if they are
travelling or emigrating to a country such as the USA or Australia, they are
subject to that country’s immigration laws and may have to disclose such
convictions.</p>

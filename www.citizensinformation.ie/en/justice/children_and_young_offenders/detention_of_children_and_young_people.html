Children Detention Campus</a>. 17-year-olds sentenced after 31 March 2017 are
also sent to the Oberstown Children Detention Campus. People aged 18 years or

<h3>Children detention schools</h3>

<p>Former Industrial Schools and Reformatory Schools were called <a shape="rect" href="http://www.iyjs.ie/en/IYJS/Pages/WP08000052">children
detention schools</a> and were managed by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.iyjs.ie/">Irish Youth Justice Service</a> which is part of the
<a href="https://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=120">Department of Children
and Youth Affairs.</a> There were 3 children detention schools which were
considered suitable to detain remanded and committed children. They were:</p>
<ul><li>Oberstown Boys School </li>
  <li>Oberstown Girls School </li>
  <li>Trinity House School </li>
</ul><p>Male offenders aged 16 to 21 were also sent to places of detention instead
of prison. The main place of detention was St. Partick's Institution, which was
formerly known as Borstal and took male offenders between the ages of 16 and
21. <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR17000117">St. Patrick's
Institution was closed on 7 April 2017</a>.</p>

<h3>Oberstown Children Detention Campus</h3>

<p>A new <a href="https://www.oberstown.com/">national children detention
facility</a> for children under the age of 18 has been developed at Oberstown.
Since June 2016, the 3 detention schools listed above have been amalgamated to
form the Oberstown Children Detention Campus.</p>

<p>Girls and boys from the age of 10 and up to the age of 18 sentenced to a
period of detention by the courts are now detained at the Oberstown campus.</p>

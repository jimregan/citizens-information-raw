<p>The legal Aid Board is a statutory body established under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0032/index.html">Civil
Legal Aid Act 1995</a>. The functions of the Board are:</p>
<ul><li>To provide legal aid and legal advice in civil cases (i.e., non-criminal
    cases) to people who meet the criteria</li>
  <li>To provide a family mediation service </li>
  <li>To provide information about its services</li>
</ul><p>This Board consists of a chairperson and twelve other members. At least five
of the members of the Board must be women and five must be men. Two members of
the Board must be barristers, two must be solicitors and two must be members of
the staff of the Board. </p>

<p>The Board has a <a href="http://www.legalaidboard.ie/lab/publishing.nsf/Content/Law_Centres">network
of full-time and part-time law centres</a> located throughout the country. The
Board has also established a panel of solicitors and barristers in private
practice who provide legal aid and advice under the Act. If a barrister is
required to deal with your case, the Legal Aid Board will appoint one to
represent you.</p>

<p>The Board also has a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.legalaidboard.ie/lab/publishing.nsf/Content/Refugee_Legal_Service">Refugee
Legal Service</a> (RLS) that provides an independent legal service to asylum
seekers at all stages of the asylum process. </p>

matters, however, it is responsible for the management and administration of 3
ad-hoc criminal legal aid schemes,</p>

<p>The Board's <a href="../../birth_family_relationships/separation_and_divorce/family_mediation_service.html">Family
Mediation Service</a> helps couples who have decided to separate or divorce, or
who have already separated, to negotiate their own terms of agreement, while

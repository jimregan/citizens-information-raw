<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>In Ireland if your constitutional right to legal representation applies and
you don't have the means to pay for legal representation, then the State (or
Government) is obliged to provide that legal representation.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../courts_system/supreme_court.html">Supreme
Court</a> has held that there is a need to put the defendant on equal terms
with the prosecution. Without legal representation, an ordinary person without
any experience of criminal law and court proceedings would be at a serious
disadvantage up against the legal resources of the prosecution. It is
interesting to note that the Supreme Court decided that it is only in certain
circumstances that somone has a constitutional right to legal representation.
There is no <em>absolute </em>constitutional right to it.</p>

<p>The main legal aid available to someone accused of a crime is the legal aid
provided under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1962/en/act/pub/0012/index.html">Criminal
Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962</a>. Criminal legal aid, unlike <a shape="rect" href="civil_legal_advice_and_legal_aid.html">civil legal aid</a>, is free.
No financial contribution is necessary. </p>

<p>If a judge considers that it is appropriate that you are granted criminal
legal aid, you will be issued a legal aid certificate. However, in some cases a
legal aid certificate may not be available. In those cases you may be entitled
to apply for free legal representation under another scheme such as the
Criminal Assets Bureau's Ad-Hoc Legal Aid Scheme or the Attorney General's
Scheme. (See 'Other legal aid schemes' below)</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>All criminal cases in Ireland start in either the <a shape="rect" href="../courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a> or the <a shape="rect" href="../courts_system/special_criminal_court.html">Special
Criminal Court</a>. The majority of cases start in the District Court. It is at
this stage that you are entitled to apply for legal aid.</p>

<p>If a charge carries a possible prison sentence and you, as the defendant,
are not legally represented, the District Court judge is required to inform you
that you may be entitled to legal aid. If you wish to be legally represented
and you claim that you can't afford it, the judge must consider whether you
qualify for free legal aid.</p>

<h3>What are the factors the judge must consider?</h3>

<p>In deciding whether or not you qualify for free legal aid under the criminal
legal aid scheme, the judge must consider the following:</p>
<ul><li>Whether your means are enough to enable you to pay for your own legal aid
  </li>
  <li>Given the seriousness of the charge or offence, whether it is in the
    interest of justice that you should have legal aid in the preparation and
    conduct of your defence. </li>
</ul><p>Normally an application for legal aid will be as straightforward as
explaining to the judge that you are unemployed and give them details of your
social welfare payments, or if you are on a low income, your salary. Sometimes
the judge will ask a prosecuting Garda if the Gardaí have any objections to
legal aid being granted. The Gardaí will rarely object unless they have proof
that you are being untruthful to the court about your means.</p>

<p>In the case of a young person the court will look at the means of the
parents or guardian to see if they can afford to pay for the legal advice.</p>

<p>The court may require a written statement from you setting out your income,
family circumstances and any other relevant details. This written statement
must be made on a form which is available from the District Court clerk at the
District Court offices.</p>

<p>It is an offence for you to knowingly make a false statement or a false
representation either verbally or in writing or to conceal any important fact
from the judge in relation to your application for legal aid. If you are found
guilty of this offence you are liable on conviction to a <a href="../criminal_law/criminal_trial/maximum_fines_on_summary_conviction.html">class
C fine</a> or to imprisonment for up to six months (or to both).</p>

<p>So, for example, if you tell a judge that you are unemployed (and are
granted legal aid) but it later transpires that you were working at the time,
you are guilty of an offence. </p>

<p>If the judge considers that it is appropriate that legal aid is granted, you
will be issued a <a shape="rect" href="legal_aid_certs.html">legal aid
certificate</a>. </p>

<h3>In what cases is legal aid granted?</h3>

<p>Generally the rule is that if the offence is a serious one and you can’t
afford to pay for your own legal advice, then the court grants a legal aid
certificate.</p>

<p>In assessing the seriousness of the case the judge considers the possibility
of you receiving a prison sentence or large fine if convicted. </p>

<p>If the offence is not a serious one, the judge may grant legal aid in
exceptional circumstances. Such exceptional circumstances include the
following:</p>
<ul><li>If you are very ill </li>
  <li>If you are immature </li>
  <li>If you lack any formal education </li>
  <li>If you are emotionally disturbed or lack the mental capacity to
    understand the process of the court case. </li>
</ul><h3>In what cases is legal aid not granted?</h3>

<p>A District Court judge will normally refuse to grant a legal aid certificate
in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul><li>Where the judge is of the view that the matters before the court are not
    serious enough. For example, road traffic offences and other minor offences
  </li>
  <li>Where the judge is of the view that you have enough means to pay for your
    own legal representation </li>
  <li>Extradition proceedings </li>
  <li>Most judicial review proceedings. </li>
</ul><p>In some cases, however, where a legal aid certificate is not available, a
person may be entitled to apply for free legal representation under another
scheme such as the Attorney General's Scheme. You can find information on other
free legal aid schemes below.</p>

<h3>Can I appeal the refusal by a judge to grant me legal aid?</h3>

<p>No, there is no appeal procedure for the refusal of criminal legal aid. You
can however make another application in a higher court if the matter is sent
forward for hearing to a higher court.</p>

<p>Legal aid granted in the District Court only covers District Court
proceedings. If you are sent forward to a higher court by the District Court to
have your case dealt with and you have already been granted free legal aid, it
will be necessary for you to apply to that higher court for legal aid for your
trial. It is very unlikely that the higher court would refuse to grant a legal
aid certificate if the District Court has already granted a certificate.</p>

<h3>Can I choose my solicitor?</h3>

<p>If you have been granted criminal legal aid, the judge assigns a <a shape="rect" href="../courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a> to your case
from the legal aid panel. If you express a desire to be represented by a
particular solicitor from the panel, the judge assigns that solicitor if he/she
is available. The constitutional right, however, to free legal aid for certain
defendants does not extend to an <em>absolute</em> right to choose a particular
solicitor or <a shape="rect" href="../courtroom/barristers.html">barrister</a>.
</p>

<p>There is no specific legal obligation on either solicitors or barristers to
participate in the free legal scheme. Each county registrar is obliged to
compile and maintain a list of solicitors who are willing to participate in the
scheme in the courts within their area. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.justice.ie/">Minister for Justice and Equality</a> also
compiles and maintains a similar list of barristers (nominated by the <a shape="rect" href="https://www.lawlibrary.ie/About-Us/Committees/Council-Committee.aspx">Bar
Council</a>) as being willing to participate in the legal aid scheme.</p>

<p>Although you have no absolute right to choose a solicitor, the courts very
rarely refuse to assign the solicitor sought by a defendant. This is so long as
the solicitor is on the legal aid panel and is available. If a judge refuses to
assign a solicitor nominated by you, the court must state the reason and should
then enquire whether you wishe to nominate any other solicitor.</p>

<h3>What costs does the scheme cover?</h3>

<p>When a legal aid certificate is granted for court proceedings it entitles
you to free legal aid for fees, costs or expenses which are incurred in the
preparation of and the conduct of your defence. It also covers the cost of an
appeal or a case stated. The fees included are those of a solicitor and in
certain circumstances, up to two counsel or barristers. </p>

<p>The legal aid certificate also covers the fees of non-legal professionals
who may be required for the preparation and conduct of your defence. Examples
of these are:</p>
<ul><li>Doctors </li>
  <li>Psychiatrists </li>
  <li>Engineers </li>
  <li>Forensic scientists </li>
  <li>Language experts. </li>
</ul><p>In a case where a defence solicitor or barrister considers the services of
such experts are necessary, their expenses are covered by the legal aid
certificate.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>In almost all cases, the application for criminal legal aid is made on your
first appearance in the District Court. The judge informs you of your right to
free legal aid and it is at this stage that the application is made by you.</p>

<p>If your case is sent forward to a higher court for hearing (for example the

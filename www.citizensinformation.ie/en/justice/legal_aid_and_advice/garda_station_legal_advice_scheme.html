<p>Under the Garda Station Legal Advice Revised Scheme, free legal advice can
be provided to those detained under certain legislation in Garda stations,
providing they satisfy a means test. The Minister for <a shape="rect" href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/Home">Justice and Equality</a>
established the original Garda Station Legal Advice Scheme in 2001. In 2011,
the <a href="legal_aid_board.html">Legal Aid Board</a> took over
responsibility for the administration of the scheme. The Garda Station Legal
Advice Revised Scheme commenced on 15 August 2014 and replaced the original
scheme. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The Garda Station Legal Advice Revised Scheme applies to those detained in a
Garda station in relation to the investigation of certain types of offences.
You must be legally entitled to consult a solicitor and you must be unable to
pay for the consultation yourself.</p>

<p>The offences the scheme applies to are: </p>
<ul><li>Offences under Section 30 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1939/en/act/pub/0013/index.html">Offences
    Against the State Act 1939</a> as amended </li>
  <li>Offences under Section 4 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1984/en/act/pub/0022/index.html">Criminal
    Justice Act 1984</a> </li>
  <li>Offences under Section 2 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0029/index.html">Criminal
    Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996</a></li>
  <li>Offences under Section 50 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/act/pub/0029/index.html">Criminal
    Justice Act 2007</a></li>
</ul><p>Those detained under Sections 16 and 17 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0027/index.html">Criminal
Procedures Act 2010</a> or Section 42 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1999/en/act/pub/0010/index.html">Criminal
Justice Act 1999</a> can also apply for legal advice under the scheme as if
detained under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984.</p>

<p>Under the scheme, fees are paid to a solicitor for: </p>
<ul><li>Telephone and in-station consultations </li>
  <li>Attendance of the solicitor at a formal interview between the Gardaí and
    the detainee</li>
  <li>Attendance of the solicitor at an identity parade</li>
</ul><p>The number of consultations the scheme will cover you for depends on the
legislation you are detained under.</p>

<h3>Extension hearings</h3>

<p>The scheme also covers payments to a solicitor who attends an extension
hearing held in the <a shape="rect" href="../courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a> where the
Gardaí apply to extend the time limit for holding a suspect under the Offences
Against the State Acts, under the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996
or under the Criminal Justice Act 2007.</p>

<h3>Means Test</h3>

<p>The scheme covers the cost of consultations with a solicitor if you cannot
afford to pay for the solicitor. When you apply you will have to complete a
statement of means. The scheme is confined to those who are in receipt of
social welfare payments and those whose annual earnings are less than
€20,316.</p>

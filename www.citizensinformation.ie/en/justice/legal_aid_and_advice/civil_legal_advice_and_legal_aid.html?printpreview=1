<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.legalaidboard.ie/lab/publishing.nsf/Content/Home">Legal Aid
Board</a> is responsible for the provision of civil legal aid and advice to
those unable to pay for such services from their own resources. </p>

<p>Legal aid means representation by a <a shape="rect" href="../courtroom/barristers.html">barrister</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a> in civil proceedings in
court, in addition to the preparatory work this entails. </p>

<p>Legal advice includes any oral or written advice provided by a solicitor or
barrister. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Legal advice</h3>

<p>Civil legal advice is any oral or written advice given to you by a solicitor
or a barrister about how the law applies in civil matters. It can also include
writing letters on your behalf or acting for you in negotiations with other
people. Legal advice is provided by the Board's solicitors in their law centre
network.</p>

<p>Legal advice may be given in relation to any legal matter with the exception
of the following:</p>
<ul><li>A criminal law matter, unless the person seeking advice is a complainant
    in a sexual assault or rape case</li>
  <li>A matter that in the opinion of the Board could be dealt with by
    obtaining appropriate advice other than state-assisted legal advice. </li>
</ul><p>The Board may decide to stop providing advice where it considers it is no
longer reasonable to do so or that the person receiving the advice is no longer
eligible because of his/her means to receive it.</p>

<p>In order to qualify for legal advice you must pass a means test. If your
application is successful you will be asked to make a financial contribution.
How much you pay will depend on your means.</p>

<p>If you are a complainant in a sexual assualt or rape case, you do not have
to pass a means test or pay a contribution.</p>

<p>If the Board refuses to grant you legal advice, you may appeal the
decision.</p>

<h3>Legal Aid</h3>

<p>Legal aid means representation by a solicitor or barrister in civil
proceedings in the District, Circuit, High and Supreme Courts. This means that
you have engaged the Board to act on your behalf in the proceedings, including
sending correspondence on your behalf, drafting court documents, giving advice,
representation in court and all the background preparatory work required.</p>

<p>Generally, legal aid is provided by solicitors employed by the Board in its
law centres. In certain family law matters, legal aid may be provided by a
solicitor in private practice from a panel of solicitors which has been
established by the Board.</p>

<p>Legal aid is available in relation to most civil matters. However, <a href="legal_aid_board.html">certain cases are excluded</a> from the scope of
civil legal aid. </p>

<p>In order to qualify for legal aid you must pass both a means test and a
merit test. If you qualify for legal aid, you will have to make some
contributions to the overall costs of the proceedings except for child-care
cases. The Rates section below sets out the minimum and maximum contributions
that may be made.</p>

<p>If the Board refuses to grant you legal aid, you may appeal the decision.</p>

<h3>Merit test</h3>

<p>This is an initial test to ensure that your case is a legitimate one and
that a reasonable person would take the case and would be advised to take the
case. You will pass the merit test, if in the Board's opinion:</p>
<ol><li>You have as a matter of law reasonable grounds for instituting, defending
    or being a party to the proceedings for which legal aid is sought</li>
  <li>You are reasonably likely to be successful in the proceedings</li>
  <li>The proceedings for which legal aid is sought are the most satisfactory
    means of achieving the result sought by you</li>
  <li>Having regard to all the circumstances (including the probable cost to
    the Board, measured against the likely benefit to you), it is reasonable to
    grant the application</li>
  <li>Your case does not fall within the excluded areas</li>
</ol><p>If the proceedings concern the welfare of a child including custody or
access, factors 2 and 4 do not apply.</p>

<h3>Means test</h3>

<p>In order to qualify for either legal advice or legal aid, you must complete
a means test form, which is available at all Legal Aid offices. The law setting
out the means test regulations are <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/si/0273.html">SI 273/1996 Civil
Legal Aid Regulations 1996</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2002/en/si/0008.html">SI 8/2002 Civil
Legal Aid Regulations 2002</a>, <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/si/0460.html">SI 460/2006 Civil
Legal Aid Regulations 2006</a> and <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/si/0346.html">SI 346/2013 Civil
Legal Aid Regulations 2013</a>.</p>

<p>The Legal Aid Board means test is different to the social welfare or Health
Service Executive (HSE) means tests. </p>

<p>The time period of relevance is the year following your application. The
Board will seek to estimate what your disposable income for that year will be.
It may be necessary to consider your income for the last year in order to do
so.</p>

<p>As well as having disposable income of less than €18,000, you must also
have disposable capital of less than €100,000 (was €320,000 before 16
September 2013). Your family home is not considered when assessing disposable
capital.</p>

<h4>Disposable income</h4>

<p>Disposable income is total income less deductible expenses including income
tax, mortgage repayments, rent, social insurance contributions, interest on
loans, child-minding expenses and other items.</p>

<h4>Income</h4>

<p>The Legal Aid Board is authorised (by your application form for legal aid)
to get information from the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/">Department of Social Protection</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/">Revenue Commissioners</a> about your
income or capital.</p>

<p>All sources or income are considered by the Legal Aid Board and taken into
account including income from a job, self-employment, pensions (both
occupational and social welfare) investments, rental income, etc.</p>

<p>The value of benefits, privileges and perks that you enjoy will be taken
into account. This includes free accommodation and/or board, and the value of a
non-contributory pension scheme. </p>

<p>In the case of a married couple, the income of both is taken into account
except</p>
<ul><li>where they are on opposing sides in the proposed action or </li>
  <li>they are separated and living apart. </li>
</ul><h4>Allowances and expenditure</h4>

<p>Once the Board has estimated your annual income, it will then seek to
calculate your disposable income by deducting the following allowances and
expenditure.</p>
<ul><li>Spouse/partner - there is a deduction of €3,500 if you have a
    spouse/partner. (The spouse/partner has to be a dependant). </li>
  <li>Dependants - there is a deduction of €1,600 for each dependant. A
    dependant may be a child or step-child under 18 or over 18 and in full-time
    education or a dependant relative or other person who lives with you and is
    supported by you. </li>
  <li>Child care expenses up to a maximum of €6,000 per child. </li>
  <li>Accommodation costs up to a maximum of €8,000 per year. </li>
  <li>PRSI contributions are deducted in full. </li>
  <li>Income tax payments are deducted in full. </li>
  <li>Ex gratia payments received up to €1,040 in total. </li>
</ul><h4>Children</h4>

<p>All persons under 18 years and those over that age in full-time education
are regarded as dependants of their parents, step-parents or guardians. </p>

<p>In those circumstances, the parents', step-parents' or guardians' income is
taken into account if the young person is looking for legal services.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>There are minimum contributions that must be paid except in cases of extreme
hardship. However, the contribution that you must make depends on your
disposable income for legal advice and your disposable income and disposable
capital for legal aid. There is no contribution required in child-care cases,
however, you still need to come within the disposable income and capital
thresholds.</p>

<p><strong>Legal advice:</strong> a minimum contribution of €30 (was €10)
must be paid where your disposable income is less than €11,500. If it is
more, your contribution is one-tenth of the difference between €11,500 and
your disposable income, up to a maximum of €150.</p>

<p><strong>Legal aid:</strong> a minimum contribution of €130 (was €50)
must be paid where your disposable income is less than €11,500. If it is
more, your contribution is €130 plus one-quarter of the difference between
€11,500 and your disposable income. You must pay an additional contribution
if your disposable capital is more than €4,000 as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Up to €54,000 your contribution is 2.5% of the difference between
    €4,000 and your disposable capital</li>
  <li>Over €54,000 your contribution is €1,250 plus 5% of the difference
    between €54,000 and your disposable capital</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If the legal matter in question is a marriage dispute and both spouses are
eligible for legal aid, they should be represented by different law centres.</p>

<p>To find out whether you qualify for legal aid and/or advice, you should

<p>There is a waiting time for an appointment with a solicitor. The maximum
waiting time for an appointment with a solicitor is four months. However, the
Board gives priority to certain categories of cases, such as domestic violence,
child care, child abduction and cases where there is a danger that the time
limits for issuing proceedings may expire.</p>

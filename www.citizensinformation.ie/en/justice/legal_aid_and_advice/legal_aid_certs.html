<p>If a judge considers that it is appropriate that you are granted <a href="criminal_legal_aid.html">criminal legal aid</a>, you will be issued a
legal aid certificate. </p>

<p>To obtain any of the legal aid certificates listed below, you must apply and
show that you have insufficient means to pay for legal representation or, in
the case of a child, the child or the child's parents or guardian have
insufficient means. There are penalties, including imprisonment, for providing
false or misleading information inorder to obtain a certificate.</p>

<p>The court must also be satisfied that the offence, with which you are
charged, is of such a serious nature, or there are exceptional circumstances,
that it is essential in the interest of justice that legal aid be provided.</p>

<p>There are a number of legal aid certificates:</p>

<h3>Legal aid (District Court) certificate</h3>

<p>When you are first charged and brought before the <a shape="rect" href="../courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a> you can apply
for a legal aid (District Court) certificate. This certificate entitles the <a shape="rect" href="../courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a> assigned to the
case to be paid for all his or her appearances in the District Court.</p>

<p>If the charge is murder or if the case is of sufficient complexity and
gravity, the legal aid (District Court) certificate will entitle you to both a
solicitor and <a shape="rect" href="../courtroom/barristers.html">barrister</a>
at the District Court stage.</p>

<h3>Legal aid (trial on indictment) certificate</h3>

<p>If you are sent forward from the District Court for trial at the <a shape="rect" href="../courts_system/circuit_court.html">Circuit Court</a> or
the <a shape="rect" href="../courts_system/high_court_criminal_jurisdiction.html">Central Criminal
Court</a> you can apply for a legal aid (trial on indictment) certificate. This
application can be made to the District Court when the District Court is
sending you forward for trial or, it can be made to the court before which you
are to be dealt with.</p>

<p>You must be charged with murder or it must appear to the court that, in the
interest of justice, you should have legal aid to assist you in the preparation
and defence of your case.</p>

<p>This certificate will entitle you to both a solicitor and barrister.</p>

<h3>Legal aid (appeal) certificate</h3>

<p>If you have been convicted of a criminal offence and wish to appeal that
conviction or the penalty imposed, you can apply for a legal aid (appeal)
certificate. The application is usually made to the court before which you have
been convicted. If the application is refused in that court you can still get
the certificate by applying to the court in which your appeal is to be
heard.</p>

<p>There are two ways of applying to the appeal court:</p>
<ul><li>By sending a letter to the registrar of the court stating the facts of
    the case and the grounds for your appeal </li>
  <li>By applying directly to the court itself </li>
</ul><p>To be eligible for the certificate the conviction must be for murder, or the
court must be satisfied that due to the serious nature of the offence it is
necessary, in the interests of justice, that you should have legal aid. </p>

<p>The certificate entitles you to a solicitor. If the appeal is to the <a shape="rect" href="../courts_system/court_of_appeal.html">Court of
Appeal</a>, however, you are also entitled to a barrister.</p>

<h3>Legal aid (case stated) certificate</h3>

<p>If you are charged with an offence before the District Court or Circuit
Court, or you are appealing to the Circuit Court against a conviction by the
District Court, the judge who is hearing the case may refer a question of law
which arises from the hearing to the <a shape="rect" href="../courts_system/high_court_civil_jurisdiction.html">High Court</a>, the
Court of Appeal or the <a shape="rect" href="../courts_system/supreme_court.html">Supreme Court</a>. This is known as
a case stated. Similarly, the District Court judge hearing the case may state a
case for the opinion of the High Court. In these situations you can apply for a
legal aid (case stated) certificate. </p>

<p>If the application to the District Court or Circuit Court is refused, you
can apply for a certificate to the court before which the case stated is to be
heard. This can be done by:</p>
<ul><li>Sending a letter to the registrar of the court setting out the facts of
    the case and the reason for the application or </li>
  <li>Applying directly to the court </li>
</ul><p>To be eligible the offence must be of a serious nature or exceptional
circumstances must apply. This certificate entitles you to both a solicitor and
barrister.</p>

<h3>Legal aid (Supreme Court) certificate</h3>

<p>If you are appealing a finding of the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court
you can apply for a legal aid (Supreme Court) certificate. Similarly, if you
are charged with an offence, you can apply for a certificate where you appeal a
finding of the High Court on a case stated by a District Court judge to the
Supreme Court. Where you are appealing a finding of the High Court the offence
must be of a serious nature or exceptional circumstances must apply.</p>

<p>If the application for a legal aid (Supreme Court) certificate is refused,
you can apply to the Supreme Court for a certificate by writing to the
registrar or applying directly to the court.</p>

<p>This certificate entitles you to both a solicitor and barrister.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../courts_system/special_criminal_court.html">Special Criminal Court</a>
can grant a legal aid certificate to a person charged with an offence before
the Special Criminal Court. The conditions that apply are exactly the same as
those for a legal aid (trial on indictment) certificate. </p>

<p>This certificate entitles you to the services of both a solicitor and a
barrister. </p>

<h3>Legal aid (behaviour order) certificate</h3>

<p>If your child (under age 18) is the subject of any court proceedings
relating to a <a shape="rect" href="../children_and_young_offenders/anti_social_behaviour_by_children.html">behaviour
order</a> you may be able to apply for a legal aid (behaviour order)
certificate. The alleged anti-social behaviour must be considered to be of a
serious nature or there must be exceptional circumstances.</p>

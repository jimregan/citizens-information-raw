<p>If you are living in Ireland and have a legal dispute in another EU country
you may be able to avail of legal aid in the other country. Access to legal aid
in cross border disputes for residents of EU member states is provided under <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1435070967106&amp;uri=URISERV:l33184">Council
Directive 2003/8/EC</a> which established minimum common rules relating to
legal aid for such disputes. An application form for legal aid was established
by <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:365:0027:0034:EN:PDF">Commission
Decision 2004/844/EC (pdf)</a>, while <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:225:0023:0027:EN:PDF">Commission
Decision 2005/630/EC (pdf)</a> established a form for the transmission of
applications between countries.</p>

<p>The appropriate authority In Ireland to apply to for legal aid if you are
involved in a cross border dispute is the <a shape="rect" href="legal_aid_board.html">Legal Aid Board</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Each member state has its own <a href="civil_legal_advice_and_legal_aid.html">financial rules and eligibility
criteria</a>. They are modified to some extent for applicants and should take
into consideration differences in the cost of living between the country you
are living in and the country where you have the legal dispute.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="legal_aid_board.html">scope of legal aid
schemes</a> and the qualifying criteria can differ between countries. As a
result, where you may get legal aid in Ireland for a particular legal dispute,
you may not qualify for legal aid in another country due to the differences in
the schemes. Similarly, you may qualify for legal aid abroad, where you would
not qualify in Ireland. In deciding whether to grant legal aid, the importance
of the case to the applicant should be taken into account.</p>

<p>While the Legal Aid Board has no role in deciding whether you should get
legal aid in the other country, you will be required to complete the Board's
means test and the Board will make a decision as to whether you would qualify
for legal aid in Ireland. If the other country requests this information in
order to help reach a decision on whether to grant legal aid or not, the board
will provide it.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you are living in Ireland and have a legal dispute in another EU country

the appropriate authority in the other country.</p>

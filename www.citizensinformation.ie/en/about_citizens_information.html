provides comprehensive information on public services and on the entitlements
of citizens in Ireland. We gather information from various government
departments and agencies, and make sure that you have all the information you
need, presented in an easy-to-understand way. </p>

<p>The site has been specially designed around the needs of users for those
times in life when you need information about your rights and how to apply for
State services in Ireland. </p>

<p>Citizensinformation.ie was developed, and is maintained by the <a href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie">Citizens Information Board</a>

website is an Irish eGovernment initiative, and was originally established
under the Government's first action plan for the Information Society. The
Citizens Information Board also provides a website on mortgage and rent arrears in conjunction with the Money Advice and
Budgeting Service (MABS) called <a href="http://www.keepingyourhome.ie">keepingyourhome.ie</a> and a website
aimed at jobseekers and people who want to start a business called <a href="http://www.gettingbacktowork.ie">gettingbacktowork.ie</a>.</p>

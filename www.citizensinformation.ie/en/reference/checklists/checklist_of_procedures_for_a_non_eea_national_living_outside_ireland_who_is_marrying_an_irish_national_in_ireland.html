<div>
<p>A non-EEA national who is marrying an Irish national does not have to be
resident in Ireland in order for it to take place in Ireland. However, there
are certain procedures that must be followed if you are living outside Ireland.
It is very important to comply with the rules regarding <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/rights_of_residence_in_ireland/residence_rights_of_non_eea_nationals_in_ireland.html">residence
for non-EEA nationals in Ireland</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/getting_married/legal_prerequisites_for_marriage.html">legal
requirements for getting married in Ireland</a>. </p>

<h3 style="BORDER-RIGHT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none">Before
the marriage</h3>
<ol><li>You must <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/getting_married/notification_requirements_for_marriage.html">notify
    the Registrar</a> that you are getting married. This must be done at least
    3 months before the marriage. You must get permission from the Registrar
    for the non-EEA national to make the 3-month notification by post. The
    non-EEA national must meet the Registrar in person at least 5 days before
    the marriage. </li>
  <li>As one of you is an non-EEA national, you will both have to attend a
    separate interview. Under the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014, the
    Registrar has the right to investigate and decide whether an intended
    marriage would be a <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pressoffice/Pages/pr180815.aspx">“marriage
    of convenience” for immigration purposes</a>.</li>
  <li>A non-EEA national <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/coming_to_live_in_ireland/visa_requirements_for_entering_ireland.html">who
    requires a visa to come to Ireland</a> can apply for a <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/short%20stay%20visas%20(less%20than%203%20months)">short-stay
    visa (a ‘C’ visa)</a> to visit Ireland. </li>
  <li>After arriving in Ireland the non-EEA national should get permission to
    remain by registering with the local immigration registration officer. In
    Dublin this is the Burgh Quay Registration Office and you must <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/registration-appointment-system">book
    an appointment online</a> to visit it. Outside Dublin it is at your <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/registration-offices">regional
    registration office</a> or your <a href="http://www.garda.ie/Stations/Default.aspx">local Garda District
    Headquarters</a>. Stamp no. 3 will be placed in the non-EEA national’s
    passport, which means they are not allowed to work in Ireland. You can find
    information about <a shape="rect" href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Stamps">immigration stamps</a>
    on the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) website. </li>
  <li>Both the non-EEA national and the Irish national should visit the
    Registrar in person to get the Marriage Registration Form at least 5 days
    before the marriage. </li>
  <li>The marriage takes place. </li>
</ol><h3 style="BORDER-RIGHT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none">After
the marriage</h3>
<ol><li><strong>If the non-EEA spouse has a short-stay (C) visa</strong> they
    must leave Ireland before the expiry date of the stay granted by the
    immigration authorities - the maximum stay is 3 months. If the non-EEA
    spouse intends to return to Ireland to live with their Irish spouse, they
    can then apply for a <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Long%20Stay%20Visas%20(More%20than%203%20months)">long-stay
    (D) visa.</a> On arrival in Ireland the non-EEA spouse must register with
    the local immigration registration officer as the spouse of an Irish
    national <br>
    or<br><strong>If the non-EEA spouse is not required to have a visa</strong> they
    must register with the local immigration registration officer as the spouse
    of an Irish national. </li>
  <li><strong>Registering as the spouse of an Irish national:</strong> It is
    important that the non-EEA spouse is accompanied by their Irish spouse when
    applying for registration to the local immigration registration officer.
    They must bring with them the marriage certificate and both valid
    passports. The residence stamp granted will depend on whether the local
    immigration registration officer is satisfied that the marriage is genuine.
    If sufficient evidence is presented to prove the marriage is genuine, a
    stamp 4 may be issued to the non-EEA national spouse. If not, the case may
    be referred to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service. There is
    no automatic entitlement to residence in Ireland following marriage to an
    Irish national. You can find further details about registering as the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP07000024">spouse
    of an Irish national on the INIS website.</a> </li>
  <li>Non-EEA nationals who are married to Irish nationals do not require a
    permit to work in Ireland once they have a stamp 4 endorsed on their
    passport. </li>
  <li>A non-EEA national spouse who has been married to an Irish national for 3
    years and meets certain residence requirements may <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/irish_citizenship/becoming_an_irish_citizen_through_marriage.html">apply
    for Irish citizenship.</a> </li>

	<h1>Checklist when applying for carer&#39;s leave</h1>
	
<ul class="anchorlinks"></ul>
<div>
<p>There are various different procedures involved when you apply for carer’s
leave and it is important to ensure that they are followed correctly.</p>

<p><strong>1. Qualifying for carer’s leave<br></strong>The qualifying requirements for carer’s leave are that:</p>
<ul><li>You must have worked for your employer for a continuous period of 12
    months and </li>
  <li>The Department of Social Protection (DSP) must decide that the person you
    are proposing to care for is in need of full-time care and attention –
    see 2 below. </li>
</ul><p><strong>2. Applying to DSP for a decision that the person needs full-time
care<br></strong>If the person you intend to care for is over 16, their GP must
complete part of the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/carb1.pdf">application form for Carer's
Benefit (pdf).</a> This is not necessary if the person is under 16 and
Domiciliary Care Allowance is being paid for them. Your employer must also fill
in part of this form giving your employment details. You should send the
completed application form to DSP, who will decide whether or not this person
requires full-time care and attention. DSP will also check if you are eligible
for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/carers/carers_benefit.html">Carer's
Benefit. </a></p>

<p><strong>3. Working out the amount of carer’s leave<br></strong>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0019/index.html">Carer’s
Leave Act 2001</a> you are entitled to at least 13 weeks’ carer’s leave up
to a maximum of 104 weeks. You can apply to take it in one continuous period or
for a number of periods amounting to a total of 104 weeks. There must be a gap
of at least 6 weeks between the periods of carer’s leave. </p>

<p>If your employer agrees you can take a shorter period of leave. However,
your employer can refuse (on reasonable grounds) to allow you to take carer's
leave of less than 13 weeks and must give you the reasons for the refusal in
writing.</p>

<p><strong>4. Giving notice to your employer<br></strong>You must give your employer at least 6 weeks’ notice of your
intention to take carer's leave. You should apply in writing saying when and
how you intend to take carer’s leave, whether it will be in one block or
separate periods. You should state that you have applied to DSP for a decision
on the person for whom you propose to care. You can find a sample notice of
intention form in Appendix A of the <a href="http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Guide_to_the_Carers_Leave_Act.pdf">Carer's
Leave Act explanatory booklet (pdf)</a>. In emergency situations where it is
not practicable to give 6 weeks' notice, you should give notice as soon as it
is reasonably possible.</p>

<p><strong>5. Confirmation of carer’s leave<br></strong>If your application for carer’s leave is successful, you and your
employer must sign a document confirming this arrangement, at least 2 weeks
before you start carer’s leave. The document should state the start date, the
duration of your carer’s leave and specify how your leave will be taken. You
can find a sample confirmation document in Appendix B of the <a href="http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Guide_to_the_Carers_Leave_Act.pdf">Carer's
Leave Act explanatory booklet (pdf)</a>. Your employer keeps the signed
document and gives you a copy of it.</p>

<p>This document is flexible, which means that your arrangement to take carer's
leave can be amended. Even if you have already started carer’s leave, your
carer’s leave (or part of it) may be postponed or varied as to how it is
taken, provided that you and your employer agree. You should both amend and
sign the confirmation of carer’s leave agreement. Again, your employer should
keep the amended agreement and give you a copy of it.</p>

<p><strong>6. Income while on carer’s leave<br></strong>You are not paid while you are on carer’s leave. You may be eligible
for Carer’s Benefit if you have enough PRSI contributions. If you do not
qualify for Carer's Benefit you may qualify for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/carers/carers_allowance.html">Carer's
Allowance</a>, which is a means-tested payment. <br>
You may do paid or voluntary work or attend a course while on carer’s leave
for up to 15 hours a week, subject to a weekly income limit set by DSP. </p>

<p><strong>7. Maintaining your PRSI contributions while on carer’s leave<br></strong>If you are getting Carer's Benefit you will get <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">credited
social insurance contributions,</a> known as credits. If you are on carer's
leave but do not get Carer's Benefit, you are still entitled to get credits.
You should get your employer to complete the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Forms/Documents/carl_credits.pdf">application
form for carer's leave credits (pdf).</a> </p>

<p><strong>8. Returning to work<br></strong>Four weeks before the date you will return to work, you must give
written notice to your employer that you intend to return to work. As regards
your employment conditions, generally you are treated as if you had been in
work during your period of carer’s leave except that you are not entitled to
pay. You are entitled to annual leave and public holidays only for the first 13
weeks of carer’s leave. </p>

<p>You are protected against being <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/enforcement_and_redress/victimisation_at_work.html">victimised
</a>for taking carer's leave or for proposing to take it.</p>

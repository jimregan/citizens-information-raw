<h2 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Introduction</h2>

<p>When you apply for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker’s
Benefit</a> you must bring certain documents with you. </p>

<h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">If
you lose your job or are made redundant</h3>

<p>If you lose your job or are made redundant you should bring your P45 or a
letter from your employer confirming the last day you worked. </p>

<p>If you don’t have your P45 or a letter from your employer you should still
apply. However, it is important to bring either your P45 or a letter from your
employer as soon as possible to your Intreo Centre or local Social Welfare
Branch Office. </p>

<p>If you have difficulty getting your P45 from your employer tell the member
of staff dealing with your claim at your Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch
Office. </p>

<p>If you are made redundant you will also need to bring documentation showing
how much redundancy you have received. If you are getting more than statutory
redundancy you should bring a letter from your employer stating how much
redundancy you have been given. If your claim for redundancy hasn’t yet been
settled you should still apply for Jobseeker’s Benefit. When you get your
redundancy payment you must inform your Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch
Office. Find out more about your rights to <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/redundancy_payments.html">redundancy
payments</a>. </p>

<h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">If
you are laid off</h3>

<p>If you are laid off temporarily, you may or may not get a P45. If you
don’t have a P45 you must bring a letter from your employer stating the
following:</p>
<ul><li>You have been laid off work without pay </li>
  <li>The last day you worked </li>
  <li>The reason for the lay off </li>
  <li>How long he or she expects you will be laid off</li>
</ul><h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">If

stating the following:</p>
<ul><li>Your days at work have been reduced on a temporary basis </li>
  <li>The number of days you worked each week </li>
  <li>The number of days you now work each week </li>
  <li>The reduction in your pay</li>

<h2>Appealing a social welfare decision </h2>

<p>If you are unhappy with a decision of the Department of Social Protection
you can make an appeal. Depending on the type of payment, you appeal either to
the Social Welfare Appeals Office or the Department of Social Protection. </p>

<p>There are a number of stages involved in the appeal process. This checklist
outlines these stages and explains the process involved in making an appeal to
the Social Welfare Appeals Office. </p>

<p>1. <strong>Is the payment or scheme you wish to appeal covered by the Social
Welfare Appeals Office?<br></strong>Most <a shape="rect" href="http://www.socialwelfareappeals.ie/uploads/Jurisdiction_of_Appeals_Process-3.pdf">social
welfare schemes are covered by the Social Welfare Appeals Office (pdf)</a>. If
the payment or scheme you wish to appeal is not covered by the Social Welfare
Appeals Office, you can ask for a review of the decision by the Department of
Social Protection but you cannot bring it to a formal appeal. </p>

<p>2. <strong>Are you within the time limits for making an appeal?</strong> <br>
Generally you have 21 days following the decision to get your appeal into the
Social Welfare Appeals Office. If your application is late, you must give the
reasons why it is late. Appeals Officers do <strong>not</strong> have to accept
late applications.</p>

<p>3. <strong>Do you need help with making your appeal?</strong> <br>
Some voluntary organisations (such as <a href="http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/">your local Citizens Information
Centre</a>) can help you to decide if you have grounds for an appeal. They can
help you to prepare your case and may even go with you on the day of your oral
hearing. </p>

<h3>Prepare your case </h3>

<p>4. <strong>Why you do not agree with the Department of Social Protection's
decision?</strong> <br>
Set out why you do not agree with the Department's decision. Get all the
documents you need to prove your case. All your documents on the appeal file
should be arranged in date order. Where photocopies only are available, they
should be of good quality and clearly legible. You may find it useful to read
some <a shape="rect" href="http://www.socialwelfareappeals.ie/case_studies/">examples of cases taken
to the Social Welfare Appeals Office</a>. </p>

<h3>Make your appeal</h3>

<p>5. Put in your <a shape="rect" href="http://www.socialwelfareappeals.ie/uploads/SWAO1.pdf">'Notice of Appeal
(pdf)'</a> with the information you have gathered before the 21 day deadline.
Remember, the Notice of Appeal should contain: </p>
<ul><li>Your name and address </li>
  <li>Your <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">Personal
    Public Service Number</a> </li>
  <li>The decision you are appealing </li>
  <li>Write down all the facts and points that support why you believe the
    Departments's decision was wrong. You should also add any documentary
    evidence you have, for example, copies of letters from the Department, your
    doctor or social worker. (If you need help with this or any part of your
    appeal contact your local Citizens Information Centre.)</li>
  <li>A copy of the letter from the Department with the Deciding Officer's
    decision </li>
</ul><p>6. <strong>Has the Social Welfare Appeals Office confirmed in writing they
got your appeal?</strong> <br>
You should get a letter from the Social Welfare Appeals Office telling you they
have received your appeal. It will contain your Appeal Reference Number. You
should put your Appeal Reference Number on all written communication with the
Social Welfare Appeals Office. You should also have it to hand if you phone
them.</p>

<h3>Social welfare appeal hearings</h3>

<p>7. <strong>Did you get a letter with a decision from the Social Welfare
Appeals Office?<br></strong>The Appeals Officer can make a decision using the information you sent
in your Notice of Appeal. However, the Appeals Officer may wish to talk with
you before making a decision. In this case, you will get a letter to attend an
oral hearing.</p>

<p>8. <strong>Did you get a letter requesting you to attend an oral
hearing?</strong><br>
You will get a letter asking you to attend an oral hearing if the Appeals
Officer wants to ask you more about your case. Don't worry - an oral hearing is
a good opportunity for the Appeals Officer to get to know your case in more
detail .</p>

<p>9. <strong>Did you take note of the date, time and location of the
hearing?</strong> <br>
Appeal hearings are non-confrontational. The Appeals Officer is there to listen
to your point of view and will make a fair decision. If you cannot make the
oral hearing contact the Social Welfare Appeals Office as soon as possible so a
change of date can be arranged. Make sure you arrive on time</p>

<h3>Social welfare appeal decisions</h3>

<p>10. <strong>You will be given a decision on your case</strong><br>
The Appeals Officer will notify you of his/her decision and the reasons for
that decision in writing. A similar letter will be sent to the Department at
the same time.</p>

<p>If there has been an oral hearing, you will get the Appeals Officer's
decision within three of four weeks. The Appeals Officer will decide on the
appeal and tell you of the decision in writing. A similar letter will be sent
to the Department at the same time. If your appeal is not successful the
Appeals Officer will explain why.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>11. If your appeal is unsuccessful</strong></p>

<p>An Appeals Officer's decision is normally final. However, an Appeals Officer
may revise his or her decision if new evidence, new facts or any relevant
change of circumstances come to light after a decision is made. The Chief
Appeals Officer may revise a decision of an Appeals Officer if it appears that
a mistake was made in relation to the law or the facts. In either case you
should submit a written statement of the grounds on which a review is sought.
You may also seek a judicial review of the Appeals Officer's decision in the
Courts, but only on a point of law.</p>

<ul><li>Act quickly</li>
  <li>Follow the retailer's or service provider's complaints process </li>
  <li>State clearly what you want to say in writing. You can find <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/index.jsp?a=524&amp;n=355&amp;p=108">examples
    of complaint template letters on the Competition and Consumer Protection

  <li>Know your consumer rights and refer to consumer legislation  </li>
  <li>If you have exhausted the complaints process and you are not satified
    with the outcome <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/contact-us">contact

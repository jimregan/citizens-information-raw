<div>
<p>When your make your online application for a <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/third_level_education/fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/maintenance_grant_schemes_for_students_on_third_level_courses.html">student
grant</a>, SUSI will make a provisional assessment. You will either get a
provisional grant approval or be told that you are not eligible. Along with the
provisional approval you will get a personalised list of documents that you
need to provide in support of your application. It is advisable to start
assembling these documents early, as there can be delays in obtaining some of
them. You should submit photocopied documents only but keep the originals safe
as you may be asked to produce them later.</p>

<p>The Department of Education and Skills encourages students to apply for
grants as soon as possible so that applications can be processed in good
time.</p>

<p>If your family income* is below certain income limits (depending on the size
of the family) you may be eligible for a grant. You must give details of the
family income when applying online. The documents you will be asked for later
are proof of the family income and they generally relate to the previous year.
For example, if you are applying for a student grant for the year 2017-2018 you
will need a P60 and/or statement of social welfare income for the year 2016.
</p>

<p>*If you are an independent mature candidate living separately from your
parents on 1 October of the year before your application, you are assessed on
your own income. You will need evidence of where you lived from 1 October of
the year before your application.</p>

<p>Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) handles all new applications since
2012-13 on and will post out personal document lists along with provisional
grant approvals. (Renewals of existing grants will be handled by the authority
that issued them initially.)</p>

<p>The table below lists the main documents required. Depending on your own
circumstances, you may need extra documents - these will be listed when you get
your provisional approval. Do not send any documentation unless requested to do
so by SUSI.</p>

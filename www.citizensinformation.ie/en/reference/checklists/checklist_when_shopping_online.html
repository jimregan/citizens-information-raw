<div>
<p>To avoid any misunderstandings after placing an order online, it is
advisable that you have full details of: </p>
<ul><li>The seller's name and address (physical address not email/web address)
  </li>
  <li>Ordering procedures and delivery schedule. </li>
  <li>Method of payment and the relevant currency. </li>
  <li>Full cost of the item or items including postage and packaging. </li>
  <li>Any other charges that may apply - VAT should be included or at least
    indicated on goods and services within the EU. (Where the goods originate
    outside of the EU, VAT and customs duty will be levied at point of entry)
  </li>
  <li>Read the seller's terms and conditions carefully to make sure you know
    what your rights and obligations are under the contract.</li>
  <li>Make sure you know what the cancellation terms and complaints procedure
    are in case you are not satisfied with the goods.</li>
  <li>Find out how your personal details are likely to be used. You should be
    able to refuse further communication from the company or from a third
    party. The seller's Privacy Policy may tell you. </li>
  <li>Make sure that when you give your personal details, including payment
    details, that the site is secure. The <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/index.jsp?a=339&amp;n=168&amp;p=131#Security">Competition
    and Consumer Protection Commission provide tips on making a secure payment
    online</a>. </li>
  <li>You should receive a confirmation email when you order the goods online.
    If you do not have email, ask for a receipt when you are paying online. It
    is a good idea to print the confirmation page when the order is placed.
  </li>
  <li>Check your credit card statement carefully to make sure that you have
    been billed correctly. Inform your bank or credit card company immediately
    if there is a discrepancy. The credit card company may contact the seller
    to clarify the situation. </li>

<h2 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Introduction<br></h2>

<p>When you apply for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s
Allowance</a> you must bring certain documents with you. </p>

<h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">If
you lose your job or are made redundant</h3>

<p>If you lose your job or are made redundant you should bring your P45 or a
letter from your employer confirming the last day you worked. </p>

<p>If you don’t have your P45 or a letter from your employer you should still
apply. However, it is important to bring either your P45 or a letter from your
employer as soon as possible to your Intreo Centre or local Social Welfare
Branch Office. </p>

<p>If you have difficulty getting your P45 from your employer tell the member
of staff dealing with your claim at your Intreo Centre or local Social Welfare
Branch Office (see ‘If you don’t have your P45’ below).</p>

<h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">If
you are laid off <br></h3>

<p>If you are laid off temporarily, you may or may not get a P45. If you
don’t have a P45 you must bring a letter from your employer stating the
following:</p>
<ul><li>You have been laid off work without pay </li>
  <li>The last day you worked </li>
  <li>The reason for the lay off </li>
  <li>How long he or she expects you will be laid off</li>
</ul><h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">If
your days of work are reduced</h3>

<p>If your days of work are reduced you must bring a letter from your employer
stating the following:</p>
<ul><li>Your days at work have been reduced on a temporary basis </li>
  <li>The number of days you worked each week </li>
  <li>The number of days you now work each week </li>
  <li>The reduction in your pay</li>
</ul><h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">You
also need to bring the following documents or information:</h3>
<ul><li>Your <a href="../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/public_services_card.html">Public
    Services Card</a> (if you don't have one you will be asked to register for
    one when applying for Jobseeker's Allowance)</li>
  <li>Your <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">Personal
    Public Service number</a> </li>
  <li>Details of your availability for work and any efforts you have made to
    get work. For example, letters you have written to employers and any
    responses you have received </li>
  <li>Details of your income </li>
  <li>Details of your spouse/partner's income (if any) </li>
  <li>Details of your <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_and_increase_in_your_payment_for_a_child_dependant.html">dependent
    children</a> </li>
  <li>Proof of your identity (see below for more information) </li>
  <li>Proof of address (see below for more information). </li>
</ul><h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Evidence
of identity</h3>

<p>You can provide evidence of your identity by showing your passport or your
driver's licence. </p>

<p>If you do not have either a passport or driver’s licence, you should bring
any other document that you may have, particularly one that has your photograph
on it. </p>

<p>The following documents may also be acceptable: credit card, debit card,
medical card, age ID card, work ID card, club membership card. </p>

<p>The following items are <strong>not</strong> accepted as proof of identity:
</p>
<ul><li>Birth or Baptismal certificates </li>
  <li>Bills or personal letters </li>
</ul><p>A claim cannot be decided until identity has been proven.</p>

<h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Evidence
of address</h3>

<p>You may be asked to show evidence of your address. You should bring any of
the following documents: </p>
<ul><li>Recent bills from utility companies such as electricity, telephone
    (landline or mobile), gas, cable television, waste charges etc. </li>
  <li>Recent statements/letters from banks, building societies, credit unions,
    credit card companies or other financial institutions </li>
  <li>Recent letters addressed to you from insurance companies, local
    authorities, government departments or the Revenue Commissioners </li>
  <li>Local authority rent book, mortgage or leasing agreement. </li>
</ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: a recent document is one issued within the last 2
months. All documents must be originals, not photocopies. </p>

<p>If there is doubt about your address, the Jobseeker's Allowance claim is not
awarded for payment until your address is verified. </p>

<h2 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">If
you don’t have your P45</h2>

<p>If you don’t have your P45 you should still apply for your Jobseeker’s
Allowance.</p>

<p>If you lose your job and your employer does not issue you with a P45, it may
be because you have not been registered for PRSI by your employer. It also
could be that you have been registered but your employer has not paid the PRSI
contributions which are due or has not paid the correct amount. Under the
Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993 the employer is obliged to register all
employees for PRSI. More information can be found about <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/employer_s_duty_to_pay_social_insurance_prsi.html">Paying
social insurance</a>.</p>

<h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Jobseeker’s
payment without a P45<br></h3>

<p>If your former employer refuses to give you a P45 you should still apply for
Jobseeker’s Allowance.</p>

<p>If you do not have a P45, the Department may informally contact your
employer when you apply for Jobseeker’s Allowance and ask him or her to send
you a P45 to help process your claim. </p>

<p>If this hasn't resulted in your former employer giving you your P45, you can
ask to fill in form IA49 at your Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office.
</p>

<p>Form IA49 is a declaration stating that you believe your former employer did
not comply with social insurance regulations. As a result of your declaration,
there will be an investigation into your employer's payment of PRSI. Filling in
form IA49 may not result in your P45, however, it may help to determine if you
qualify for Jobseeker's Allowance. </p>

<h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Other
ways to get your P45</h3>

<p>If you are not given a P45 when you leave your job you should first ask your
employer for it. If the employer does not supply it you should contact the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/contact/index.html">tax
office</a>.</p>

<p>If you contact your tax office, Revenue will contact the employer and obtain
your P45 for you. If you have not been given your P45 and you think that your
PRSI contributions have not been paid you should inform your local social
welfare inspector by contacting your Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch
Office or the Scope section of the Department of Social Protection. </p>

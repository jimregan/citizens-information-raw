<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Civil
Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010</a> a
redress scheme has been introduced for opposite-sex cohabiting couples who are
not married and same-sex cohabiting couples who are not registered in a civil
partnership. The redress scheme provides for a broadly similar range of orders
as are available to married couples when they separate or divorce. </p>

<p>The aim is to provide protection for a financially dependent member of the
couple if a long-term cohabiting relationship ends either through death or
separation. The Act came into effect on 1 January 2011. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l50230">Cohabitants</h2>

<p>Cohabitants are defined in the Act as two same-sex or opposite-sex adults
who are:</p>
<ul><li>Not married to each other and not in a registered civil partnership</li>
  <li>Not related within the prohibited degrees of relationship (broadly
    speaking, relationships which would make them ineligible to marry each
    other)</li>
  <li>Living together in an intimate and committed relationship</li>
</ul><h3>Qualified cohabitants</h3>

<p>A financially dependent cohabitant may be able to apply to the courts for
redress if the relationship ends as the result of death or otherwise. In order
to apply for redress you must be a qualified cohabitant, that is, you must have
been:</p>
<ul><li>A cohabitant for at least 5 years or </li>
  <li>A cohabitant for 2 years if you have had a child with your partner </li>
</ul><p>However, if one of you is still married, then neither of you may be a
qualified cohabitant until the married person has been living apart from
his/her spouse for at least 4 of the previous 5 years – in effect, until he
or she is entitled to seek a divorce.</p>

<p>The redress arrangements applies only to those qualified cohabitants whose
relationship ends after the Act commenced on 1 January 2011, but the time spent
cohabiting before that may be taken into account.</p>

<h3>Redress orders</h3>

<p>If you are a qualified cohabitant, you may apply for orders such as
maintenance orders, property adjustment orders, and pension adjustment orders
and related orders such as attachment of earnings orders. You may also apply
for provision to be made from the estate of a deceased cohabitant. You do not
have any automatic right to get such orders. The court may make such orders if
it is satisfied that you were financially dependent on your cohabitant
partner.</p>

<p>In making a decision, the courts must take into account a number of factors
including </p>
<ul><li>The financial circumstances, needs and obligations of each cohabitant</li>
  <li>The rights of others (including the rights of spouses, former spouses,
    civil partners, former civil partners and dependent children of either
    partner) </li>
  <li>The duration and nature of the relationship </li>
  <li>The contribution made by each, financial and otherwise</li>
</ul><p>Such orders may not affect the rights of spouses or former spouses. They may
affect the rights of civil partners or former civil partners. </p>

<p>In general you must apply for such orders within 2 years of the end of the
relationship but an application for provision from the estate of the deceased
partner must be made within 6 months of an application for a grant of probate.
In general, such orders will lapse and will no longer be available if you
marry.</p>

<h3>Redress orders and tax</h3>

<p>Any maintenance payment ordered by the court is treated as your income and
you have to pay tax on it. The amount of the maintenance payment is allowed as
a deduction from the income of your former cohabitant. More information is
available in our <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/maintenance_and_tax.html">document
on maintenance and tax</a>.</p>

<p>Where a property adjustment order is made, there are no <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/capital_taxes/capital_gains_tax.html">capital
gains tax</a>, <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/capital_taxes/capital_acquisitions_tax.html">gift
or inheritance tax</a> issues for either of you on the transfer, and no stamp
duty is payable. However, when the property is disposed of at a later date, the
total period of ownership of the property by both of you is taken into
consideration for the purposes of determining whether any capital gains tax is
payable on the later disposal.</p>

<h3>Voluntary agreements</h3>

<p>Agreements on financial matters between cohabitant partners may be regarded
as valid only if:</p>
<ul><li>Each of you has had independent legal advice or you have received legal
    advice together and have waived the right to independent legal advice </li>
  <li>The agreement constitutes a contract </li>
  <li>The agreement has been signed by each of you </li>
</ul><p>Such an agreement may include a provision that the redress scheme does not
apply to them. This is different from similar agreements by married couples.
Agreements between a married couple may not validly exclude either party’s
right to apply to the courts for various orders (for example, a maintenance
order). A court may set aside or vary a cohabitants’ agreement in exceptional
circumstances if its enforcement would cause serious injustice. Agreements
entered into by cohabitants before the Act commenced are enforceable.</p>

<div>
<p>To access environmental information you can use <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/freedom_of_information.html">Freedom
of Information</a> legislation or the European Communities (Access to
Information on the Environment) Regulations 2007 to 2014. An unofficial
consolidation of these Regulations (<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/si/0133.html">SI 133 of 2007</a>,
<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/si/0662.html">SI 662 of
2011</a> and <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2014/en.si.2014.0615.pdf">SI 615 of
2014 (pdf)</a>) is available <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Legislation/Environment/Miscellaneous/FileDownLoad,30002,en.pdf">here
(pdf)</a>. </p>

<p>These Regulations give effect to <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0004:EN:HTML">Directive
2003/4/EC</a> on Public Access to Information on Environmental Matters, which
provides that individuals have the right to access environmental information
held by public authorities. This is the first of 2 Directives to implement the
<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/aarhus/">Aarhus Convention</a> (UNECE
Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making
and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters 1998). Ireland <a href="http://www.environ.ie/environment/aarhus-convention/aarhus-convention">ratified
the Aarhus Convention</a> on 20 June 2012.</p>

<p>The Aarhus Convention lays down a set of basic rules to promote citizens'
involvement in environmental matters and improve enforcement of environmental
law. It allows the public to have <a href="../../environment/environmental_protection/access_to_environmental_information.html">access
to environmental information</a>, provides for participation in environmental
decision-making, and allows the public to seek redress when environmental law
is infringed. </p>

<p>The EU approved the Aarhus Convention in 2005 (<a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32005D0370:EN:HTML">Council
Decision 2005/370/EC</a> of 17 February 2005).</p>

<p>The second Directive implementing the Aarhus Convention is <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0035:EN:HTML">Directive
2003/35/EC</a> on Public Participation in respect of the Drawing up of Certain
Plans and Programes relating to the Environment. This deals with public
participation in decision-making. It provides that member states must ensure
that mechanisms exist to facilitate public participation in decisions about the
environment. Under the provisions of this Directive, members of the public are
entitled to <a href="../../environment/environmental_protection/judicial_review_in_planning_and_environmental_matters.html">appeal
relevant decisions of public bodies by way of judicial review</a>.</p>

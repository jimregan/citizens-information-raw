<div>
<p><a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/capital_taxes/capital_acquisitions_tax.html">Capital
Acquisitions Tax</a> was introduced in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act 1976
and amended in subsequent finance acts. The relevant legislation was
consolidated in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0001/index.html">Capital
Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003</a>. The guidance notes incorporate
changes that have been made by Finance Acts up to and including the Finance
Act, 2006.</p>

<p>When Capital Acquisitions Tax was introduced in the Capital Acquisitions Tax
Act 1976, it replaced a system of death duties. Capital acquisitions tax
applies to gifts taken on or after 28 February 1974 and to inheritances taken
on or after 1 April 1975. The tax became a self-assessment tax in 1989. A
probate tax was imposed on estates of deceased persons in the Finance Act 1993,
but that tax was<br>
abolished in the Finance Act 2001.</p>

<p>The Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 is divided into 12
parts. The main subjects of the 12 parts are as follows:</p>
<ol><li>definitions. </li>
  <li>gifts. </li>
  <li>inheritances. </li>
  <li>how property is to be valued for capital acquisitions tax purposes. </li>
  <li>general provisions relating to gifts and inheritances. </li>
  <li>dealing with returns and assessments. </li>
  <li>dealing with payment of tax, interest and penalties. </li>
  <li>provisions dealing with appeals. </li>
  <li>exemptions from gift and inheritance tax. </li>
  <li>the various reliefs, i.e. agricultural relief, business relief and
    other<br>
    miscellaneous reliefs. </li>
  <li>miscellaneous provisions relating to capital acquisitions tax. </li>
  <li>repeals, the commencement of the Act and transitional<br>
    provisions.</li>
</ol><p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/act/pub/0011/index.html">Finance
Act 2007</a> introduced changes regarding the dwellinghouse exemption to the
Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003. The 2010 Finance Act
introduced <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/cat/leaflets/cat-probate-notice-may2010.html">a
number of administrative changes in CAT</a>,</p>

<p>including the introduction of a new pay and file regime, the compulsory
electronic filing of all CAT reliefs, the introduction of surcharge for the
late filing of CAT returns, the abolition of secondary accountability and the
further</p>

<p>abolition of the 12 year charge on property rule.</p>

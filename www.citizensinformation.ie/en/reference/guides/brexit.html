<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l3cdc6">Brexit - what it means</h2>

<p>On 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) voted to leave the <a href="/en/government_in_ireland/european_government/european_union.html">European
Union (EU)</a>. The UK leaving the EU is known as ‘Brexit’ (short for
‘Britain’ and ‘exit’).</p>

<p>On 29 March 2017, the UK gave notice to the <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/european_government/eu_institutions/european_council.html">European
Council</a> under <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2016/577971/EPRS_BRI(2016)577971_EN.pdf">Article
50 of the Treaty on European Union (pdf)</a> of its intention to leave the
EU.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="la273f">What happens next</h2>

<p>From 29 March 2017 the EU and the UK have 2 years to negotiate arrangements
for the UK to leave. These 2 years can be extended, if the UK and the European
Council agree. You can find more information in the Irish Government’s
information note <a href="http://www.merrionstreet.ie/en/EU-UK/Article_50_What_happens_next_FINAL.pdf">Brexit-About
Article 50 (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It is important to note that the UK remains a member of the European Union.
It will continue to remain a member while negotiations are taking place.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lc9926">Brexit and you</h2>

<p>If you are an Irish citizen living in the UK, your rights have not changed
and will not change until new laws are made.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you are a UK citizen living in Ireland, your rights have not
changed.</p>

<p>The current arrangements for social security between Ireland and the UK have
not changed. All social welfare payments made by the Department of Social
Protection, including pensions and Child Benefit, continue to be paid as
normal.</p>

<p>Social security arrangements between the UK and the EU27 (the European Union
members, not including the UK) have also not changed. This will be one of the
many matters to be discussed as part of the negotiations. </p>

<p>The Citizens Information Board will be tracking any changes to rights and
entitlements that are likely to affect Irish citizens in the UK and UK citizens
in Ireland. We will update this webpage with information as it becomes
available, with a particular focus on residence, employment, social welfare,
healthcare, education and consumer law. We will also update the main
information pages on citizensinformation.ie.</p>

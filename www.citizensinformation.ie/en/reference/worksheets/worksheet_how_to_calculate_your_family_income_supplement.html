Supplement you may get in 2017.</h3>

<h3>Worksheet</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
Income Supplement (FIS)</a> is a weekly tax-free payment available to married
or unmarried employees with children. To qualify for FIS, your average total
weekly family income must be below a certain amount for your family size. FIS
pays 60% of the difference between your total family income and the income
limit which applies to your family. </p>

<p>To find out your weekly FIS payment, firstly calculate your total family
income. Secondly, take away your total family income from the maximum income
limit set for your family size (see table below). The FIS payment you get is
60% of the difference between your total family income and the income limit
which applies to your family, rounded up to the nearest euro.</p>

<p>You can also use a <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Benefit-of-Work-Ready-Reckoner-Introduction.aspx">Benefit
of Work Ready Reckoner</a> from the Department of Social Protection to help you
assess out the financial consequences of taking up full-time work. The Reckoner
works out the total amount you would receive on taking up full-time work
(including any Family Income Supplement) and compares this to what you are
getting in jobseeker payments (including Rent Supplement).</p>

1: Calculate your total income</h3>

<p>Weekly net household income from employment - see Note 1 ____________</p>

<p><strong>Add</strong> net weekly household income from <br>
self-employment - see Note 2 ____________</p>

<p><strong>Add</strong> social welfare payments - see Note 3 ____________</p>

<p><strong>Add</strong> income from occupational pensions ____________</p>

<p><strong>Add</strong> income from maintenance - see Note 4 ____________</p>

<p>Total Family Income ___________</p>

<p><strong>Note 1</strong> <br>
Weekly household income from employment is your weekly income from employment
and your spouse’s, civil partner's or cohabitant's weekly income from
employment. Net earnings for FIS purposes is gross pay minus tax, PRSI,
Universal Social Charge and superannuation.</p>

<p>If a dependent child is has income from employment it is not taken into
account.</p>

<p><strong>Note 2<br></strong>Net weekly household income from self-employment includes the net
weekly income from self-employment of both you and your spouse, civil partner
or cohabitant. If a dependant child is has income from self-employment it is
not taken into account.</p>

<p><strong>Note 3</strong> <br>
Income from some social welfare payments are taken into account. All income
from carer's payments is taken into account. However, the following payments
<strong>are not </strong>taken into account: Child Benefit, Guardian’s
Payment (Non-Contributory) and Guardian’s Payment (Contributory),
Supplementary Welfare Allowance, Domiciliary Care Allowance and Foster Child
Allowance. </p>

<p><strong>Note 4</strong><br>
If you are getting maintenance, the total amount of your maintenance payment
will be assessed as income for FIS. Only one FIS payment can be made in respect
of any family, the parent from whom you are getting maintenance must not be
getting FIS.</p>

<p>A parent getting maintenance for a qualified child will also have that
maintenance assessed for FIS. </p>

2: Take away your total income from the maximum income limit for your family
size.</h3>

<p>In the table below find the maximum income limit for a family with the
number of children you have. From this maximum income limit for your family
size, take away your total family income.</p>

<p><strong>FIS income limits in 2017</strong></p>

<table border="1" width="312" cellpadding="1" summary="FIS income limits for 2010" cellspacing="1"><thead><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>If you have:</strong></td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>And your weekly family income is less
        than:</strong></td>
    </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">One child</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€511</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Two children</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€612</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Three children</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€713</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Four children</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€834</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Five children</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€960</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Six children</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€1,076</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Seven children</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€1,212</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Eight children</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€1,308</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p><strong></strong></p>

<p>For example, if you have three children and your weekly total family income
is €350. The maximum family income for a family of your size is €713 (see
table above). The difference between €350 and €713 is €363. </p>

<h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Step
3: Get 60% of the difference between your total family income and the maximum
income limit set for a family of your size.</h3>

<p>To find out the FIS payment you will get: calculate 60% of the difference
between your total family income and the maximum income limit set for a family
of your size.</p>

<p>For example, if you have three children and your weekly total family income
is €350. The maximum family income for a family of your size is €713 (see
table above). The difference between €350 and €713 is €363. Your rate of
FIS is 60% of €363. In this case, €217.80 is 60% of €363. Your FIS
payment is €218 (rounded).</p>

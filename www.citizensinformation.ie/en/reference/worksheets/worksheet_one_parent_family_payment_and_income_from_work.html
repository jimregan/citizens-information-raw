One-Parent Family Payment</a> (OPF) this worksheet will help you to work out
how taking up a job will affect your weekly income.</p>

<h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Step
1: Find how income from work will affect your One-Parent Family Payment<br></h3>

<p><strong>Find your</strong> assessable income from work (see <strong>Note
1</strong>) €_______</p>

<p>Assessable income is your gross income less PRSI, pension contributions and
trade union subscriptions.</p>

<p><strong>Note 1</strong> </p>

<p>Take away €110 from your weekly earnings (if earnings are below €110 you
will keep your full OFP). Half of your weekly earnings between €110 and
€425 is assessed as income. </p>

<p><strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>New rate</strong> of One-Parent Family Payment €_______</p>

<p>To find your new rate of OPF <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Jobseekers-supports.aspx">check SW 19
Social Welfare Rates of Payment booklet to find out how much OPF is payable
with your means</a>.</p>

<h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Step
2: Find your new total gross weekly income<br></h3>

<p>Your total weekly income is your new rate of One-Parent Family Payment and
your income from work before tax.</p>

<p><strong>New rate</strong> of One-Parent Family Payment (see <strong>Step
1</strong> above) €_______<br><strong>Add</strong> Gross weekly income from work €_______<br><strong>Total</strong> Gross weekly income €_______</p>

<h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Step
3: Find your new total net weekly income<br></h3>

<p>Your total weekly income is your new rate of One-Parent Family Payment and
your income from work after tax. From this calculation you will be able to find
out if you are financially better off.</p>

<p>Gross weekly income €_______<br><strong>Less</strong> Universal Social Charge - see Note 2 below €_______<br><strong>Less</strong> PRSI paid each week - see Note 3 below €_______<br><strong>Less</strong> income tax paid each week - see Note 4 below €_______
<br><strong>Total</strong> net income €_______<br><strong>Remember, you may have to pay child-minding and travel costs out of
your net income</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note 2</strong></p>

<p>You will pay a Universal Social Charge (USC) on your gross income from work
(if your overall income is above €13,000). Find out more about the <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">Universal
Social Charge</a>. You do not pay USC on your OFP payment. </p>

<p><strong>Note 3<br></strong>You pay <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">PRSI</a>
on income from your work only, not on your One-Parent Family Payment. If you
earn less than €352 a week you do not pay any PRSI. You only pay PRSI for the
weeks you work.</p>

<p><strong>Note 4</strong></p>

<p>You pay <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/starting_work_and_changing_job/starting_work/tax_and_starting_work.html">income
tax (PAYE)</a> on all your income: that is your gross weekly income (see
<strong>Step 2</strong> above).</p>

<p>To calculate how much income tax you pay each week, multiply your gross
weekly income by 20% to get the gross amount of income tax payable each week.
</p>

<p>Total gross income by 20% €_______ <br><strong>Less</strong> Weekly Tax Credit (see below for calculation) </p>

<p><strong>Total</strong> income tax paid each week €______ </p>

<p>(Note that in practice your OFP payment is coded in against your tax credits
and rate band by Revenue - this worksheet simply shows you how to work out how
income from work will affect your OFP.)</p>

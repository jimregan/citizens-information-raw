<p>(See note 6)</p>

<p><strong>Total Net Income</strong> ____________</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Note 1</strong></p>

<p>€200 of income from insurable employment is not taken into account. Any
amount above this is assessed as means. All income from self-employment is
assessed as means.</p>

<p><strong>Note 2</strong></p>

<p>If a qualified adult is working, €200 of income from insurable employment
is not taken into account. Any amount above this is assessed as means. All
income from self-employment is assessed as means.</p>

<p><strong>Note 3</strong></p>

<p>If you are married in a civil partnership or cohabiting with another person,
your means will be taken as half the joint means of you and your spouse/civil
partner/cohabitant.</p>

<p><strong>Note 4</strong></p>

<p>If your means are more than €30 you can get a reduced pension. Find out
the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Publications/sw19/Pages/sw19_sect2.aspx">rate of
pension paid after means are assessed</a>. <strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Note 5</strong></p>

</p>

<p>If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is under 66 they are liable for
PRSI. If they are earning less than €352 per week they are not liable for
PRSI. </p>

<p><strong>Note 6</strong></p>

<p>Multiply total Gross Income by 20% to get the gross amount of income tax
payable each week. From this figure subtract your Weekly Tax Credit to get the
amount of weekly tax paid.</p>

<p>Single Person = €68.17</p>

<p>Married Couple (one person working and one person over 65) = €99.90</p>

<p>Married Couple (one person working and both over 65) = €104.61</p>

<p>Married couple (both working and one person over 65) = €131.63</p>

<p>Married couple (both working and both over 65) = €136.35</p>

<p><strong>Universal Social Charge</strong></p>

<p>You will pay a Universal Social Charge (USC) on your gross income from work.
The amount of USC you will pay depends on your income and your age.</p>

Date you started work <br>
(for example, 1 April 2004) -------------- <br><br>
Number of full years' service <br>
(for example, 10 years) -------------- <br><br>
Number of days in part of a year's service <br>
(total of days in every incomplete year worked <br>
for example, 1 April 2014 to 30 June 2014 = 3 months = 91 days)
---------------<br><br>
Deduct any non-reckonable service <br>
(see <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/redundancy_payments.html">Redundancy
payments</a> for details <br>
for example, 30 weeks' sick leave in 2012, 4 weeks is <br>
non-reckonable. 4 weeks = 28 days) ---------------- <br><br>
Total reckonable service <br>
(for example, 10 years, 63 days (91-28) ---------------- <br><br>
Total of the days in a part year as percentage of a year <br>
(for example, 63 ÷ 365 x 100 = 17.26%) ---------------- <br><br>
Total amount of service <br>
(for example, 10.17 years) ---------------- <br><br>
Amount of your normal weekly pay <br>
(gross pay, that is, before tax and PRSI deducted <br>
for example, €700, ceiling on weekly pay is €600) ----------------<br><br>
Statutory redundancy lump sum payment due <br>
(2 weeks' pay for each year of service + one extra week <br>
for example, 2 weeks x 10.17 = 20.34 + 1 week = 21.34 weeks. <br>
Example lump sum due is €12.804 (€600 x 21.34) ----------------</p>

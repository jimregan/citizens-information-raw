<ul class="anchorlinks"></ul>
<div>
<p>This worksheet aims to help you find out how taking up part-time or casual
work will affect your weekly Jobseeker's Allowance. </p>

<p>Income from work is assessed as means and can affect your Jobseeker's
Allowance payment. Other sources of income or means can also affect your
Jobseeker's Allowance, for example, <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/maintenance_and_social_welfare_payments.html">maintenance</a>,
<a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/how_parents_income_can_affect_jobseekers_allowance.html">benefit

(including savings and investments). In this worksheet we are only looking at

income from work can affect your payment</a>.</p>

<p>A person is entitled to Jobseeker's Allowance (JA) only for periods of
unemployment. You must be unemployed for at least 4 days in a period of 7
consecutive days to get JA. More information on the qualifying criteria is
available in our document on <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's

<p style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Find
your assessable weekly earnings.</p>

<p style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">The

        any contribution towards superannuation, union dues, PRSA or AVC. He

      </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Step
2: Find out if your assessable weekly earnings are over the limit</h3>

<p style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Before
you calculate how much JA you can get, you must find out if your weekly means
are more than the maximum JA payment for your situation. The maximum
Jobseeker’s Allowance payment includes the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Publications/sw19/Pages/sw19_sect6.aspx">personal
payment</a> and any increases for an <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">adult

children</a>. If your <em>means</em> are halved, an increase for a qualified
adult is not included in the maximum Jobseeker’s Allowance payment for your
situation and you will only get a half-rate increase for each qualified child.
</p>

<p style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">In
this step you are not calculating the actual amount of JA you will get, you are
just checking to see if you have any possibility of getting JA. </p>

<p style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">To
do this take your assessable weekly earnings from Step 1 and deduct €20 per
day for each day you have worked up to a maximum of €60. Next get 60% of the
balance. This is assessed as your weekly means. </p>

<p style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Assessable
weekly earnings - €20 = total x 60% = weekly means from work.</p>

<p style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none"><strong>Your
means are halved</strong> if your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is:</p>

  </li>
</ul><p>Note: If your means are halved, you will not get an increase for a qualified
adult but you will get a half-rate increase for each qualified child when
finding the maximum Jobseeker’s Allowance payment for your situation.</p>

<p style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none"><strong>If
your weekly means are less than the maximum Jobseeker’s Allowance payment for
your situation then</strong> <strong>go to Step 3 and start to calculate the
actual amount of JA you will get.</strong></p>

        €150 per week. He works 3 days.</p>

        <p>€150 - €60 (3 days) = €90 x 60% = €54</p>

        <p>Weekly means from work = €54 </p>

        <p>In this example, Jim’s weekly means are below the basic JA payment
        for his situation. Go to Step 3.</p>

<h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Step
3: Average daily earnings</h3>

<p style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Now
that you know you are entitled to a JA payment, you can start to calculate the
rate of your JA payment.</p>

<p style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Calculate
your average daily earnings: to do this get your total weekly assessable
earnings from employment and divide by the number of days you worked that week.
</p>

<p style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Total
weekly earnings ÷ number of days worked = average daily earnings.</p>

4: Daily means from work</h3>

<p style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Calculate
your daily means from work.</p>

<p style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">To
do this, you must disregard any income not taken into account. Income not taken
into account is €20 for days worked. Next get 60% of the balance. This is
assessed as your daily means. </p>

<p style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Average
daily earnings - €20 = total x 60% = daily means from work.</p>

        Wednesday) and gets €50 per day. His average daily earnings are €50
        (see Step 3).</p>

        <p>€50 - €20 = €30</p>

        <p>Get 60% of total (€30 in this example) = €18</p>

5: Weekly means from work</h3>

<p style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Multiply
your daily means by the number of days worked (including Sunday). If you get
paid for a public holiday and don't work that day, it will be included in the

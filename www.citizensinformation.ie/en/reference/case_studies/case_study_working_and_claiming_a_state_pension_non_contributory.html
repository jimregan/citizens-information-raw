<h3>This case study shows the effect of work on State Pension
(Non-Contributory) in 2016</h3>

<h3>Case study</h3>

<p>Joe is 67 years of age and has been claiming a State Pension
(Non-Contributory) for a little over a year now. He receives an increase in his
payment for his wife Jean. Jean is 62 years old and works part-time as a
book-keeper. She earns €130 a week net. (<em>Net earnings</em> are total
earnings less deductions for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">PRSI</a>,
private health insurance, superannuation and union dues.) They have no other
income but have savings of €56,000.</p>

<p>At the moment Joe's pension payment is the maximum State Pension
(Non-Contributory) €368.70. Their total weekly income is €498.70.</p>

<p>Joe has been offered some part-time work as a caretaker in a local school.
If he takes the job his net weekly wage will be €260. Jean is thinking of
increasing the number of hours she works. Her new net weekly income would be
€206. </p>

<p>Joe wants to know how his State Pension (Non-Contributory) will be affected
if he starts work in the local school and Jean increases the number of days she
works. </p>

<p><strong>Joe and Jean's new assessable means</strong>.<br>
Joe's assessable income from work (See note 1) €60 </p>

<p><strong>Add</strong> Jean's assessable income from work (See note 2) €6
</p>

<p><strong>Add</strong> income from savings (See note 3) <u>€16 </u></p>

<p><strong>Total </strong> €82 </p>

<p><u>÷ 2 </u> </p>

<p>Divide by 2 to get their assessable weekly means: €41 </p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Total assessable weekly means </strong>(See note 4) <strong>€41
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Weekly State Pension (Non-Contributory) </strong>(See note 5)
€<strong>347.90</strong></p>

<p>Their new total weekly income will be €813.90<br>
(Total income is made up of Joe's State Pension (Non-Contributory) and their
income from work).</p>

<p><strong>Note 1</strong></p>

<p>Joe's assessable income from work: Joe will earn €260 (net) per week.
€200 is not taken into account. Therefore Joe's assessable income from work
is €60.</p>

<p><strong>Note 2</strong><br>
Jean's assessable income from work: Jean will earn €206 (net) per week.
€200 is not taken into account. Therefore Jean's assessable income from work
is €6.</p>

<p><strong>Note 3</strong><br>
Income from savings for a couple is calculated as follows:</p>

<table style="WIDTH: 403px; HEIGHT: 159px" border="1" summary="" width="403" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">First €40,000 </td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Nil</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Next €20,000</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€1 per €1,000 per week</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Next €20,000</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€2 per €1,000 per week</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Excess €80,000</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€4 per €1,000 per week</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Note 4</strong><br>
If you are married or are cohabiting with another person as husband and wife,
your means will be taken as half the joint means of you and your spouse/civil
partner/cohabitant. </p>

<p><strong>Note 5</strong><br>
Joe's new personal rate of State Pension (Non-Contributory) is €209.50. He
also gets an extra amount or increase of €138.40 for Jean as a qualified
adult. You can find out more about <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Publications/sw19/Pages/sw19_sect2.aspx">the

study showing how Jobseeker's Allowance is affected by a spouse or partner's
income in 2012</h3>

<p>Anna is getting Jobseeker's Allowance and is living with her partner Paul.
Paul has been getting Invalidity Pension for a couple of years now. He has been
offered some rehabilitative work for three mornings each week. He knows his
earnings of €110 from rehabilitative work will not affect his Invalidity
Pension. However, Anna wants to know if her Jobseeker's Allowance will be
affected if Paul takes up rehabilitative work. Her payment is already reduced
because they are living together.</p>

<p><strong>Note that from 2012 people gettting Invalidity Pension can no longer
get exemptions for rehabilitative work.</strong></p>

<h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Step
1: Find Anna's current rate of Jobseeker's Allowance (JA)</h3>

<p>Maximum payment to Anna and Paul (<strong>note 1</strong>) €331.60</p>

<p></p>

<p>Paul's rate of Invalidity Pension €193.50 </p>

<p>Anna's rate of Jobseeker's Allowance (<strong>note 1</strong>)
<u>€138.10</u></p>

<p>Total social welfare payments €331.60</p>

<h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Step
2: Find Anna's rate of JA after Paul's income from rehabilitative earnings is
taken into account</h3>

<p>Anna's current reduced rate of Jobseeker's Allowance €138.10</p>

<p><strong>Less</strong> assessable income from Paul's rehabilitative work
€15 (<strong>note 2</strong>)</p>

<p><strong>Anna's new rate of Jobseeker's Allowance €123.10</strong></p>

<p></p>

<h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Note
1</h3>

<p>If one of a couple is claiming Jobseeker's Allowance and the other is
getting of one of the social welfare payments listed below, the total amount
paid to the couple cannot exceed the amount paid to one person and his/her
adult dependant.</p>
<ul><li>Illness Benefit </li>
  <li>Disablement Pension (when paid with Injury Benefit or Incapacity
    Supplement) </li>
  <li>Injury Benefit </li>
  <li>Invalidity Pension </li>
  <li>State Pension (Non-Contributory) </li>
  <li>State Pension (Contributory) </li>
  <li>State Pension (Transition) </li>
  <li>Jobseeker's Benefit </li>
</ul><p>However, you can choose the higher-rate payment as the primary payment. For
example, Anna and Paul have choosen Paul's Invalidity Pension as the primary
payment rather than Anna's Jobseeker's Allowance because Invalidity Pension is
paid at a higher weekly rate. </p>

<p>Claimant on Invalidity Pension (IP) under 65 years rate €193.50<br>
Qualified Adult rate for IP under 65 years <u>€138.10</u><br>
Maximum payable to Anna and Paul €331.60</p>

<h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Note
2</h3>

<p>Paul's income will affect Anna's rate of Jobseeker's Allowance.</p>

<p>Paul’s income from employment is €110. </p>

<p>€20 per day from casual work (up to a maximum of €60) will be deducted
from his average assessable weekly earnings and 60% of the balance will be
assessed as his means from employment.</p>

<p>€110 - €60 (3 days worked) = €50 x 60% = €30</p>

<p>Means of €30 is halved because Paul is getting a social welfare
payment.</p>

<p>Total weekly means = €15</p>

<p><strong>Note that from 2012 people gettting Invalidity Pension can no longer
get exemptions for rehabilitative work.</strong></p>

<p>The following allowances are always deducted from your gross earnings to get
your assessable earnings. </p>
<ul><li>PRSI contributions</li>
  <li>Union dues </li>
  <li>Superannuation </li>
  <li>PRSA (Personal Retirement Savings Account) </li>
  <li>AVCs (Additional Voluntary Contributions). </li>
</ul><p></p>

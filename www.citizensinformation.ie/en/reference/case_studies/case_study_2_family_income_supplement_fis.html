<h3>This is an example showing how income is assessed for Family Income
Supplement in 2017</h3>

<h3>Case study</h3>

<p>John is living with his partner Mary and their four children. He has been
working for a company for some time but his hours are irregular, varying from
30 to 48 hours per week. As a result, he can earn between €300 and €480
gross per week. Mary is getting Carer’s Allowance of €209 and also works
part-time as a home-help for the Health Service Executive (HSE) earning €96
per week. Their daughter is 15 years old and has a part-time job at the
weekend, earning €45 per week. John and Mary get Child Benefit of €560 per
month for their four children.<br><br>
Weekly net income from employment (See note 1) €349.71 plus €96 = 445.71</p>

<p><strong>Add</strong> weekly net income from self-employment 0</p>

<p><strong>Add</strong> social welfare payments (See note 2) €209</p>

<p><strong>Add</strong> Income from occupational pensions 0 </p>

<p>Total income €654.71 </p>

<p>The maximum income limit for a family with four children is €834. The
difference between €834 and €654.71 is €179.29. 60% of the difference is
€107.57</p>

<p><strong>John will get a FIS payment of €108 each week (rounded up to
nearest euro).</strong></p>

<h3>Note 1</h3>

<p>John’s hours are irregular and therefore the amount he earns can vary from
week to week. To find his total weekly income the Department can average his
income over a period of six to eight weeks. The most recent P60 is often used
to calculate the average income from employment. In this case, his income
averaged out over six weeks is €349.71.</p>

<p>John’s income from employment is assessed and Mary’s casual income from
working as a home help for the HSE is also assessed. Their daughter’s income
is not assessed because she is under 22 years of age and in full-time
education. </p>

<h3>Note 2</h3>

<p>Child Benefit is not included in the assessment of Family Income Supplement.
However all of Mary's Carer's Allowance will be assessed as income - this is
€209. </p>

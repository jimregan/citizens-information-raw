	<h1>Case study: Taking parental leave</h1>
	
<ul class="anchorlinks"></ul>
<div>
<p>John and Mary want to take parental leave in respect of their son Michael,
who is 5 years old. John has been working for his employer for 9 months and
wants to take the leave in 2 months' time. The employer has told John that he
cannot spare him at this time and anyway, he is not entitled to parental leave
as he hasn't been working for him for a year. </p>

<p>John's employer is correct about the length of service. After 3 months'
service, an employee is entitled to reduced parental leave if the child is
nearing the upper age limit. Since the child will not be 8 for another 3 years
however, this will not apply to John's claim. John should consider taking his
leave when he has one year's service. John's employer could postpone the leave
then on the grounds of for example, the nature of John's duties. Unless John is
involved in work with a seasonal variation however, the leave could only be
postponed once for up to 6 months. </p>

<p>Mary has been with her employer for 15 months. Her employer says that
parental leave is only for emergencies and in any case, it doesn't apply if the
employee has already had 18 weeks' maternity leave. Is this right? </p>

<p>No, Mary's employer is mistaken. Parental leave is not confined to emergency
situations and the only stipulation is that the parent uses the leave to care
for the child. Mary's employer may be confusing parental leave with force
majeure leave. Furthermore, the fact that Mary took maternity leave does not
affect parental leave as they are completely separate types of leave set down
by different laws. </p>

<p>As a first step, Mary should give her employer at least 6 weeks' written
notice of her intention to take parental leave, the starting date and duration.
Mary should keep a copy of this notice. If she has continuing difficulties with
her employer, Mary should make a complaint to the <a href="../../employment/enforcement_and_redress/labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace
Relations Commission</a> using the online complaint form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.</p>

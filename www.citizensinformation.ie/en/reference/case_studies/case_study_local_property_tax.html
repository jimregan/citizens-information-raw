<h3>Example 1: Couple (no outstanding mortgage) who qualify for full
deferral</h3>

<p>Seán and Eileen are married and owner-occupiers. They have calculated that
their LPT liability for 2015 is €405. Their estimated gross income for 2014
is €23,000. They are under the limit (€25,000) to qualify for a full
deferral so they can decide to opt for a full deferral of their LPT liability.
A charge for the deferred amount, including interest, will be placed on the
property.</p>

<h3>Example 2: Single person (no outstanding mortgage) who qualifies for
partial deferral</h3>

<p>Emma is single and an owner-occupier. She has calculated that her LPT
liability for 2015 is €315. Her estimated gross income for 2014 is €18,000.
Therefore her gross income is over the limit (€15,000) to qualify for a full
deferral but under the limit (€25,000) to qualify for a partial (50%)
deferral. </p>

<p>If Emma decides to opt for a partial deferral she must confirm which payment
option she will use to pay the balance of her LPT (€157.50). A charge for the
deferred amount, including interest, will be placed on the property.</p>

<h3>Example 3: Single person (with mortgage) who qualifies for partial
deferral</h3>

<p>Ross is single and an owner-occupier. He has calculated that his LPT
liability for 2015 is €202. His estimated gross income for 2014 is €27,000
and his anticipated gross mortgage interest for 2014 is €6,000. To qualify
for a full deferral Ross’s gross income must not exceed €15,000 plus 80% of
his gross mortgage interest:</p>

<p>Gross income threshold: €15,000 + 80% of Ross’s gross mortgage interest
(80% of €6,000): € 4,800</p>

<p><strong>Ross’s adjusted income threshold for full deferral =
€19,800</strong></p>

<p>As Ross’s gross income (€27,000) is greater than his full deferral
adjusted income threshold (€19,800) he does not qualify for a full deferral.
However, he may qualify for a <em>partial deferral</em>.</p>

<p>To qualify for a partial deferral Ross’s gross income must not exceed
€25,000 plus 80% of his gross mortgage interest:</p>

<p>Gross income threshold: €25,000 + 80% of Ross’s gross mortgage interest
(80% of €6,000): €4,800</p>

<p><strong>Ross’s adjusted income threshold for partial deferral =
€29,800</strong></p>

<p>As Ross’s gross income (€27,000) is less than his partial deferral
adjusted income threshold (€29,800) he qualifies for a partial (50%)
deferral. </p>
<!--If Ross decides to opt for a partial deferral of his LPT liability he should select the partial deferral option on his LPT return and confirm which payment option he will use to pay the balance of his LPT (€101). A charge for the deferred amount, including interest, will be placed on the property.this section produces the further information bit at the bottom of the document.

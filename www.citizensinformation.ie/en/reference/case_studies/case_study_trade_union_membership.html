	<h1>Case study: Trade union membership</h1>
	
<ul class="anchorlinks"></ul>
<div>
<p>Gerry has been working part-time (10 hours a week) for 6 months with a
takeaway restaurant. He decides that he will join a <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/industrial_relations_and_trade_unions/trade_unions.html">trade
union</a> because the conditions in the job are bad. None of the other
employees is in a union. He is showing some information he got from the union
to a fellow employee when his employer comes into the takeaway and sees what
Gerry is doing. At finishing time that day, the employer tells Gerry he no
longer needs his services as demand has dropped. What rights does Gerry
have?</p>

<p>Gerry has been working for the employer for less than a year, so in normal
circumstances he would not be able to bring a claim for <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfair
dismissal.</a> However, this requirement does not apply to a dismissal for
trade union activity. It would appear that Gerry’s dismissal is related to
his employer’s discovery that he had been in contact with a union. This gives
Gerry a strong case to argue that this discovery was the reason for the
dismissal and not a drop in demand.</p>

<p>Gerry could bring his case for unfair dismissal to the <a href="../../employment/enforcement_and_redress/labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace
Relations Commission</a> using the online complaint form available on <a href="http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Referring-a-Dispute/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.</p>

<h2 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">This
case study looks at the choices available to people getting Jobseeker’s
Allowance, One-Parent Family Payment and Disability Allowance. </h2>

<h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Anne
has been getting Jobseeker’s Allowance for 9 months and is starting a
full-time course of further education at second level:</h3>

<p>Anne cannot get Jobseeker’s Allowance (JA) and attend full-time education.
She should apply for the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA). Her rate of
payment on BTEA will be the same as the rate of Jobseeker’s Allowance she is
getting and she can keep any secondary benefits she is currently getting. She
will not get the maintenance component of a student grant with BTEA, but she
will be financially better off on BTEA than she would be on the maintenance
grant alone.</p>

<p>Since Anne is doing a Post-Leaving Certificate (PLC) course and getting the
BTEA she is exempt from the student participant charge (€200). She may have
to pay a course charge for books, exam fees and other costs.</p>

<p>If she was getting the BTEA for another type of course (for example, a
third-level course) she would have to apply to SUSI to be assessed for the fee
component of the student grant, covering the student contribution and any
tuition fees/essential field trip costs.</p>

<p></p>

<h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Peter
has been getting a One-Parent Family Payment for 3 years and is starting a
full-time course in higher education at third level:</h3>

<p>Peter is getting a One-Parent Family Payment which means he has two options
and will need to work out which will give him the higher income.</p>

<p>1. Peter can stay on his One-Parent Family Payment and get a student grant
(both maintenance and fee components). If he chooses this option he will
continue to get his One-Parent Family Payment at his current rate as well as
the grant. However, he will lose any secondary benefits such as Rent
Supplement. If he is nearing the end of his entitlement to One-Parent Family
Payment, the Back to Education Allowance may be of greater benefit to him
because it is paid for the duration of his course. </p>

<p>2. Peter can transfer from One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) to the Back to
Education Allowance (BTEA). If he chooses this option, he will not get the
maintenance component of the student grant. His rate of payment on BTEA will be
the same as the rate of One-Parent Family Payment he was getting and he can
keep any secondary benefits he is currently getting. </p>

<p>He must still apply to SUSI to be assessed for the fee component of the
student grant, covering the student contribution and any tuition fees/essential
field trip costs.</p>

<h3 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Maria
has been getting a Disability Allowance for a number of years and is starting a
full-time course in higher education at third level:</h3>

<p>Maria is getting a Disability Allowance which means she has two options and
will need to work out which will give her the higher income.</p>

<p>1. Maria can stay on Disability Allowance and get a student grant (both
maintenance and fee components). If she chooses this option she will continue
to get Disability Allowance at her current rate. However, she will lose any
secondary benefits she is already getting such as Rent Supplement or Mortgage
Interest Supplement. If she is living at home, her parents’ income may affect
the amount of maintenance grant she will get. It may mean she will get a
reduced amount of maintenance grant, or just the fee component of the student
grant, or neither. She must notify the Disability Allowance Section in the
Department of Social Protection that she is starting a course of study.<br><br>
2. Maria can transfer from Disability Allowance (DA) to the Back to Education
Allowance (BTEA). If she chooses this option and qualifies for BTEA she will
not get the maintenance component of the student grant. Her rate of payment on
BTEA will be the same as her rate of Disability Allowance and she can keep any
secondary benefits she is currently getting. </p>

<p>She must still apply to SUSI to be assessed for the fee component of the
student grant, covering the student contribution and any tuition fees/essential
field trip costs. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>This case study shows how tax credits and bands are adjusted by
Revenue to account for Maternity Benefit. Note that these examples do not refer
to people who are jointly assessed with their spouse or civil partner.
</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<p>Employees are entitled to a personal tax credit (€1,650 in 2015) and a
PAYE tax credit (€1,650 in 2015). Their standard rate cut-off point is the
amount of their personal standard rate tax band. For each pay period, they pay
tax at the standard rate of tax (20%) up to their standard rate cut-off point.
Any income over the standard rate cut-off point is taxed at the higher rate of
40%. When the total amount of tax has been calculated their tax credits are
subtracted from this figure to give the total amount of tax owed.</p>

<p>When a woman goes on maternity leave she may qualify for 26 weeks of
Maternity Benefit. The standard rate of Maternity Benefit is €230 each week
so a woman who qualifies for the standard payment will be paid €5,980 of
Maternity Benefit in total. Revenue will reduce her tax credits and weekly
standard rate cut-off point to account for the tax payable on her Maternity
Benefit. The tax due on the weekly Maternity Benefit (€230 x 20% = €46)
will be deducted from her weekly tax credits and the total amount of Maternity
Benefit will be deducted from her weekly cut-off point. If a woman does not
have her Maternity Benefit topped up by her employer a refund of tax may arise
which can be calculated when she returns to work (see Example 2 below)</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l0ca00">Example 1: Ann is paid her full salary while
on maternity leave</h2>

<p>Ann is on maternity leave. She continues to receive her normal gross salary
of €700 per week and Maternity Benefit of €230 per week is paid directly by
the Department of Social Protection (DSP) to Ann’s employer.</p>

<p>Revenue will receive the Maternity Benefit details directly from the DSP,
reduce Ann’s annual tax credits and rate band by the Maternity Benefit amount
(see above for how this is done), and send a revised tax credit certificate to
her employer. Ann’s revised weekly rate band will be €400.76 and her weekly
tax credits will be €17.46.</p>

<p>Ann’s weekly salary of €700 while she is on maternity leave is made up
of:</p>

<p><strong>Maternity Benefit:</strong> €230</p>

<p><strong>Company Salary:</strong> €470</p>

<p><strong>Total:</strong> €700</p>

<p>The company salary portion (€470) has tax, USC and PRSI deducted by the
employer. The tax payable on the Maternity Benefit portion (€230) is
collected by the reduction in Ann’s tax credits and rate band. Maternity
Benefit is not chargeable to USC or PRSI.</p>

(€470):</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lc9c26">Example 2: Sally is not paid any top-up
by her employer while she is on maternity leave. Her Maternity Benefit is paid
directly to her while she is on leave.</h2>

<p>Sally is not paid by her employer while on maternity leave so the following
applies. Sally earned €700 per week (€36,400 a year). She paid tax, PRSI
and Universal Social Charge weekly. Her tax and Universal Social Charge were
deducted on the assumption that she would continue to earn the same amount for
the rest of the year.</p>

<p>When she goes on maternity leave and starts getting Maternity Benefit she is
no longer liable to pay the Universal Social Charge or PRSI (since these are
not charged on Maternity Benefit). She may get a refund of Universal Social
Charge. When she returns to work she will probably also get a refund of tax
since while she is on maternity leave her tax credits are more than the tax due
on her Maternity Benefit and she may also have paid extra tax on her salary
before going on maternity leave.</p>

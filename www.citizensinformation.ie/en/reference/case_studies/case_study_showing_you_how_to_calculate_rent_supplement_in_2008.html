is an example showing how Rent Supplement is calculated in 2015</h3>

<h2 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Case
study</h2>

<p>Susan and Paul have 2 children aged 6 and 12. Paul has been unemployed for 1
year but has recently found work and will start his new full-time job in a
couple of weeks. His net income from work will be €440 each week. </p>

<p>Susan had been getting half-rate Carer’s Allowance because Paul was
getting Jobseeker’s Benefit and claiming for her as an adult dependant. When
Paul returns to work she will get full-rate Carer’s Allowance. She will not
get any increases for their children because Paul's income is over €400 a
week. Their 6-year old child is getting Domiciliary Care Allowance. Their only
other income is from Child Benefit. However, they may also apply for Family
Income Supplement when Paul starts work.</p>

<p>Susan wants to know if they can keep any of their Rent Supplement when Paul
starts work.</p>

<p>Their rent is €950 per month which is within the limit for their area.
They have been assessed by their local authority as in need of housing under
the Rental Accommodation Scheme so they can retain their Rent Supplement while
Paul is in full-time employment. </p>

<h2 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Step
1: Calculate the household's <em>gross assessable weekly income</em> from all
sources</h2>

<table border="1" style="width: 100%"><caption></caption>
  <col><col><tbody><tr><td><strong>Income source</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Amount</strong></td>
    </tr><tr><td>Assessable income from employment</td>
      <td>€440 </td>
    </tr><tr><td>Carer's Allowance</td>
      <td>€204 </td>
    </tr><tr><td>Family Income Supplement </td>
      <td>€25.20</td>
    </tr><tr><td><em>Gross assessable weekly income</em></td>
      <td><strong>€669.20</strong></td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>Note that Child Benefit and Domiciliary Care Allowance are not included as
income. Susan may also get a Respite Care Grant in June from the Department of
Social Protection. The Respite Care Grant is not taken into account as income.
</p>

<h2 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Step
2: Find out what your <em>income in excess of the Supplementary Welfare
Allowance (SWA) rate</em> is</h2>

<p>To do this you deduct the Over 65 disregard, the Carer’s disregard, travel
costs, PRSI and the <a href="../checklists/checklist_swa_rates_for_rent_supplement.html">Appropriate
SWA rate for your circumstances</a> from your gross assessable income to find
out what your <em>income in excess of the SWA rate</em> is.</p>

<table border="1" style="width: 100%"><caption></caption>
  <col><col><tbody><tr><td>Gross assessable weekly income (see <strong>Step 1</strong>) </td>
      <td>€669.20</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Less Carer's disregard*</td>
      <td>-€79.20</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Less PRSI (4% of €440)</td>
      <td>-€17.60</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Less appropriate SWA rate for a couple with 2 children</td>
      <td>-€370.40</td>
    </tr><tr><td><em>Income in excess of the SWA rate</em></td>
      <td>€202</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<p>*The amount of Carer's Allowance (CA) in payment above the appropriate SWA
rate for the carer is not taken into account. The appropriate SWA rate for the
carer is either the Increase for a Qualified Adult (if you are a couple) or the
personal rate (if you are a single person). </p>

<p>Susan is living with her partner Paul. The SWA rate for a qualified adult is
subtracted from her Carer’s Allowance and the remainder is not taken into
account.</p>

<p>Carer’s Allowance: €204</p>

<p>Less IQA: <strong></strong><u>€124.80</u><br><strong><strong><strong>Susan's Carer's disregard is</strong>
€79.20</strong></strong></p>

<h2 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Step
3: Calculate the <em>Additional income disregard</em> </h2>

<table border="1" style="width: 100%"><col><col><tbody><tr><td>Additional income = <strong>(A+B) - C</strong> </td>
      <td><strong>Income</strong></td>
    </tr><tr><td><p><strong>A</strong> = Gross income from: </p>
        <ul><li>Full or part-time work</li>
          <li>Family Income Supplement</li>
        </ul></td>
      <td><p>€440</p>

        <p>€25.20</p>
      </td>
    </tr><tr><td><strong>Total A:</strong></td>
      <td>€465.20</td>
    </tr><tr><td><strong>B</strong> = assessable income from other sources: 
        <ul><li>Carer’s Allowance/Benefit </li>
          <li>Subtract Carer’s disregard (Subtract SWA IQA rate from actual
            carer's payment)</li>
        </ul></td>
      <td><p>€204</p>

        <p>-€79.20</p>
      </td>
    </tr><tr><td><p><strong>Total B:</strong></p>
      </td>
      <td>€124.80</td>
    </tr><tr><td><strong>C</strong> = SWA rate for family circumstances</td>
      <td>€370.40</td>
    </tr><tr><td><p><strong>Total C:</strong></p>
      </td>
      <td></td>
    </tr><tr><td>(A+B) – C = Additional Income</td>
      <td>€219.60</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Subtract PRSI, pension contributions, income continuance</td>
      <td>-€17.60</td>
    </tr><tr><td><em>Additional Income for disregard</em></td>
      <td>€202</td>
    </tr><tr><td><p>If <em>Additional Income for disregard</em> is less than or equal
        to €75 this figure is the Additional income disregard.</p>

        <p>If not do this calculation:</p>
      </td>
      <td></td>
    </tr><tr><td>Subtract €75</td>
      <td>-€75</td>
    </tr><tr><td><strong>Subtotal</strong></td>
      <td>€127</td>
    </tr><tr><td><p>25% of subtotal</p>
      </td>
      <td>€31.75</td>
    </tr><tr><td><p>Add €75 + 25% of subtotal to get <em>Additional Income
        disregard</em></p>
      </td>
      <td>€106.75</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<h2 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Step
4: Subtract the <em>Additional Income disregard</em> from your <em>income in
excess of the SWA rate</em> (figure at the end of Step 2). This figure is your
<em>contribution from means</em>. </h2>

<p>Income in excess of the SWA rate: €202</p>

<p>Less Additional Income disregard: €106.75</p>

<p><em>Contribution from means</em>: €95.25</p>

<h2 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Step
5: Find your <em>total weekly contribution to rent</em> by adding your
<em>contribution from means</em> to your <em>minimum Household
Contribution</em>. </h2>

<p>Contribution from means: €95.25</p>

<p>Plus Minimum Household Contribution: €40</p>

<p><em>Total weekly contribution to rent</em>: €135.25</p>

<p>You must pay a minimum contribution towards your rent in addition to any
assessable income. This is €30 for a single person and €40 for a couple.
This minimum contribution may be increased depending on the number of
non-dependent members in the household getting social welfare payments. In this
case, the minimum household contribution is €40.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Step 6: Find your Rent Supplement payment by subtracting your <em>total
weekly contribution to your rent</em> from your weekly rent.</h2>

<p>Susan and Paul are paying €950 per month for accommodation. </p>

<p>To get the weekly rent figure, multiply €950 by 12 and divide by 52.</p>

<p>Monthly rent €950 x 12 ÷ 52 = €219.23</p>

<p>Weekly rent: €219.23</p>

<p>Less Susan and Paul's total weekly contribution to rent: €135.25<br></p>

<p><strong>Susan and Paul will get a weekly Rent Supplement of
€83.95</strong></p>

studies on how to calculate your tax in 2017</h3>

<p>These examples show the different factors involved in <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/how_your_tax_is_calculated.html">calculating
your tax</a> in 2017. </p>

<h2 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Tax
credits</h2>

<p>Joan is single and earns €28,000 a year. She receives her notice of
determination of tax credits and standard rate cut-off point from Revenue. </p>

<p>Joan’s tax credits are listed on the notice as:<br>
Single Person Tax Credit = €1,650 <br>
Employee (PAYE) Tax Credit = €1,650 <br><strong>Tax credit total </strong>= €3,300</p>

<p>The standard rate cut-off point for a single person is €33,800. Because
Joan’s income is below the cut-off point, all of her income is taxed at the
standard rate, (20%), to give her gross tax.<br>
28,000 x 20% = €5,600 gross tax.</p>

<p>All her tax credits are deducted from the gross tax to give the tax that is
payable:<br>
€5,600 - €3,300 = €2,300</p>

<p>Joan is also liable to pay the Universal Social Charge (USC). Find out more
about <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">the
Universal Social Charge</a>.</p>

<p>USC = €690.46</p>

<p>The total amount deducted from her income is:</p>

<p>€2,300 (income tax) + €690.46 (USC) = <strong>€2,990.46</strong></p>

<p>You can get the monthly or weekly amount of the total tax that should be
deducted from wages by dividing this annual figure by 12 or by 52
respectively.</p>

<h2 style="BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-RIGHT: medium none">Tax
rates and the standard rate cut-off point</h2>

<p>A single taxpayer who earns €40,000 a year will have their tax calculated
as follows:</p>

<p>The standard rate band for a single taxpayer is €33,800.<br>
This means that the first €33,800 is taxed at the standard rate of tax, 20%,
and the remainder (€6,200) is taxed at the higher rate of tax, 40%.<br>
€33,800 x 20% = €6,760 <br>
€6,200 x 40% = <u>€2,480</u><br>
Total = €9,240</p>

<p>Tax credits are deducted from this amount to give the tax due. A single PAYE
(Pay As You Earn) taxpayer is entitled to <br>
Single Person Tax Credit = €1,650 <br>
Employee (PAYE) Tax Credit = <u>€1,650</u><br>
Total = €3,300</p>

<p>In this example, the taxpayer is not entitled to any <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/">other tax credits</a>
so the total tax due is:<br>
Gross tax of €9,240</p>

<p>Minus tax credits of <u>€3,300</u><br>
Tax due = €5,940</p>

<p>The USC on gross income is also payable. The total amount deducted from
income in the year is:</p>

<p>€5,940 (income tax) + €1,290.46 (USC) = <strong>€7,230.46</strong></p>

<h3>This case study shows the affect of work on Jobseeker's Allowance in
2017</h3>

<h3>Case study</h3>

<p>John is living with his partner Mary and their two children. He recently
lost his job as a barman but has managed to get some part-time work in a local
restaurant. He is working two days a week. His assessable earnings for social
welfare purposes are €110 per week. (Assessable earnings are gross earnings
less deductions for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">PRSI</a>,
superannuation and union dues.) His wife cares for her mother, who lives
nearby, and is getting full-rate <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/carers/carers_allowance.html">Carer's
Allowance</a>. She is also getting <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child
Benefit</a> for each of their two children.</p>

<p>John wants to go back to bar work and has applied to a number of local pubs
and hotels. He heard that he can get Jobseeker's Allowance (JA) for the days
the he is not working and wants to know how much JA he is entitled to.</p>

<p>Other than Mary's social welfare payments and John's part-time work they
have no other income. However, they have savings of €17,500.</p>

<p>He is entitled to JA only for periods of unemployment. The minimum period a
person must be unemployed in order to receive JA is 4 days in a period of 7
consecutive days. </p>

<p>Jobseeker's Allowance rate (<strong>note 1</strong>) €222.80</p>

<p><strong>Less</strong> average weekly means (<strong>note 2</strong>)
<u>€21</u></p>

<p><strong>Total Jobseeker's Allowance weekly rate</strong>
<strong>€201.80</strong></p>

<h3>Note 1</h3>

<p>Calculate the maximum JA payment John would be entitled to if he didn’t
have any means. John’s maximum payment is €222.80. </p>

<p>This is made up of his personal payment of €193 and €14.90 for each of
his two children (John gets a half-rate <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_and_increase_in_your_payment_for_a_child_dependant.html">Increase
for a Child Dependant)</a>. </p>

<p>His wife also gets a half-rate increase for child dependants with her
Carer's Allowance payment. He will not get an <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">Increase
for a Qualified Adult</a> because his wife Mary is getting her own social
welfare payment, full-rate Carer’s Allowance. (However, John could claim an
Increase for a Qualified Adult if Mary agrees to getting <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/carers/half_rate_carers_allowance.html">half-rate
Carer's Allowance</a>. The family can check to see if this would be of greater
benefit to them.) </p>

<h3>Note 2</h3>

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>John's average assessable weekly earnings are €110.</p>

<p>First you must find out if John's weekly means disqualify him from getting
JA. €20 per day from casual work (up to a maximum of €60) will be deducted
from his average assessable weekly earnings and then 60% of the balance will be
assessed as his weekly means.</p>

<p>€110 – €40 (2 days worked) = €70 x 60% = €42</p>

<p>John's weekly means from employment of €42 is less than the maximum amount
he would be entitled to for his circumstances (€222.80). </p>

<p>Now you know he is entitled to a certain amount of Jobseeker's Allowance the
next step is to calculate the <strong>actual amount</strong> of Jobseeker's
Allowance he is entitled to. To do this you must calculate his
<strong>'assessable daily earning'</strong></p>

<p>He is entitled to JA only for periods of unemployment. The minimum period a
person must be unemployed in order to receive JA is 4 days in a period of 7
consecutive days. John has 4 consecutive days of unemployment. He is employed
for 2 days. </p>

<p>John's average assessable daily earnings are (€110 ÷ 2 days work) =
€55.</p>

<p>Less disregard for day worked €55 - €20 = €35 </p>

<p>60 % of his assessable daily earnings of €35 = €21</p>

<p>Weekly means is €21 x 2 (number of days worked) = €42</p>

<p>John's weekly means from employment is €42</p>

Jobseeker's Allowance is affected by income from employment</a> and in our <a shape="rect" href="../worksheets/worksheet_jobseekers_allowance_and_income_from_work.html">Worksheet
on Jobseeker's Allowance and income from work</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Capital</strong></p>

<p>His savings are not taken into account because they are below the €20,000
threshold. </p>

and social welfare payments</a>.</p>

<h3>Cash income</h3>

<p>His wife's Carer's Allowance and Child Benefit are not taken into account in
the assessment of means. As she is getting her own social welfare personal
payment (Carer's Allowance) he cannot claim a qualified adult increase for
her.</p>

<p>More information is available in our document <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/cash_income_not_included_in_the_social_welfare_means_test.html">Cash
income and social welfare payments</a>.</p>

<h3>Weekly means</h3>

<p>His means of €42 is halved because his wife is getting a social welfare
payment. </p>

<p>More information is available in our document about the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/means_test.html">means
test</a></p>

<p><strong>Therefore, his total means is assessed as €21.</strong></p>

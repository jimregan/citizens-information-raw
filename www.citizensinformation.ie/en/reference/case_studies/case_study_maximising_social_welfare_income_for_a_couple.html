	<h1>Case study: Maximising a couple&#39;s income from jobseeker&#39;s
  payments</h1>
	
<ul class="anchorlinks"></ul>
<div>
<p>Mary is working and earning €224 a week. Her days at work have been
reduced permanently to 3 days. She has an entitlement to Jobseeker’s Benefit
(JB). As her days at work are permanently reduced she will be assessed for JB
as a part-time worker and not a systematic short-time worker. </p>

<p>John has been out of work for some time and his JB claim has come to an end.
He has applied for Jobseeker’s Allowance (JA). He has been offered a
part-time job and will be working 2 days and earning €100 each week. </p>

<p>John and Mary have 2 children aged 7 and 12. They have no assessable means
other than that from employment. </p>

<p>What social welfare payments can John and Mary claim and which payments will
maximise their household income? </p>

<h3>Answer </h3>

<p>In the case of Mary and John, you must do 4 separate calculations to find
out which social welfare payment or combination of payments will maximise their
income. </p>

<p>You must calculate their social welfare entitlement based on the 4 following
situations: </p>
<ol><li>John claims JA for the whole family – see ‘Assessment 1’ below </li>
  <li>Mary claims JB for the whole family – see ‘Assessment 2’ below </li>
  <li>John claims JA and Mary claims Family Income Supplement (FIS) – see
    ‘Assessment 3’ below</li>
  <li>John and Mary claim separate social welfare payments: John claims JA and
    Mary claims JB – see ‘Assessment 4’ below.</li>
</ol><h3>Assessment 1: John claims JA for the family </h3>

<p>Personal rate €193 </p>

<p>IQA* rate €128.10 </p>

<p><u>IQC** rate €59.60</u> (for 2 children)</p>

<p>Total €380.70 </p>

<p>Less means €98.00 (from Mary’s employment – see Note 1 below) </p>

<p><u>Less means €36 </u>(from John’s employment – see Note 2 below) </p>

<p><strong>Total JA for John €246.70 </strong></p>

<p>*Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA) </p>

<p>** Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC) </p>

<table border="1"><caption></caption>
  <col><tbody><tr><td>Total income for Assessment 1: 

        <p>Add their sources of income together to find their total income: </p>

        <p>John’s JA + Mary’s income from work + John’s income from work
        = total income €246.70 + €224 + €100 = €570.70 </p>

        <p><strong>Total income = €570.70 </strong></p>
      </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<h3>Assessment 2: Mary claims JB for the family </h3>

<p>Personal rate €193 </p>

<p>IQA €128.10 (not reduced as John’s earnings are only €100) </p>

<p><u>IQC €59.60</u> (for 2 children) </p>

<p>Total JB €380.70 </p>

<p>However, because Mary is working part-time 3 days each week, she is only
eligible to claim for JB for 2 days. She will get two-fifths (40%) of
€380.70.</p>

<p><strong>Mary’s JB payment is €152.28 payment</strong> for 3 days of
unemployment. </p>

        = total income </p>

        <p>€152.28 + €224 + €100 = €476.28 </p>

        <p><strong>Total income = €476.28</strong> </p>
      </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<h3>Assessment 3: John claims JA and Mary claims FIS</h3>

<p>1. John’s JA claim: </p>

<p>Personal rate €193 </p>

<p>No IQA </p>

<p><u>Half-rate IQC €29.80</u> (for 2 children)</p>

<p>Total €222.80 </p>

<p>Less means €49 (half Mary’s means – see Note 1 and 3 below) </p>

<p><u>Less means €18 </u>(half John’s means – see Note 2 and 3 below)
<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Total JA for John €155.80</strong> </p>

<p></p>

<p>2. Mary’s FIS claim: </p>

<p>Add their assessable income together: </p>

<p>Mary’s income from work* €224 John’s income from work* €100 </p>

<p><u>John’s JA payment €155.80</u> </p>

<p>Total assessable income €479.80</p>

<p>*Income from work less disregards </p>

        <p>€80 + €224 + €100 + €155.80 = €559.80</p>

        <p><strong>Total income = €559.80 </strong></p>
      </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<h3>Assessment 4: John and Mary claim separate jobseeker’s payments </h3>

<p>1. John’s JA claim for himself only: </p>

<p>Personal rate €193</p>

<p>No IQA </p>

<p>Half IQC €29.80 (for 2 children) </p>

<p>Total €222.80 </p>

<p>Less means €49 (half Mary’s means – see Note 1 and 3 below) </p>

<p>Less means €18 (half John’s means – see Note 2 and 3 below) </p>

<p><strong>Total JA for John €155.80 </strong></p>

<p>2. Mary’s JB claim for herself only: </p>

<p>Personal rate €193 </p>

<p>No IQA </p>

<p>Half IQC €29.80 (for 2 children) </p>

<p>Total JB €222.80 </p>

<p>However, because she is working part-time 3 days each week, she will get two
fifths of €222.80. </p>

<p><strong>Mary’s JB payment is €89.12</strong> - payment for 3 days of
unemployment. </p>

<p><strong>Maximum payment rule: </strong></p>

<p>Where separate payments are being claimed you must allow for maximum payment
in your calculation – see Note 4 below. </p>

<p>€155.80 + €222.80 = €378.60, this amount is not greater than the
maximum payment of €380.70, so John’s JA payment will not be reduced. </p>

<table border="1"><caption></caption>
  <col><tbody><tr><td>Total income for Assessment 4: 

        <p>Add their sources of income together to find their total income: </p>

        <p>John’s JA payment + John’s income from work + Mary’s JB
        payment + Mary’s income from work = total income </p>

        <p>€155.80 + €100 + €89.12 + €224 = €568.92</p>

<h3>Conclusion </h3>

<p>In this case study, the family are very slightly better off with Assessment
1 (John claims JA for the whole family). However Assessment 4 (John and Mary
claim separate jobseeker payments) might be better since both partners are
eligible for training and education schemes in their own right. </p>

<p><strong>Note 1 </strong></p>

<p>Mary’s means from work for John’s JA assessment are calculated as
follows: </p>

<p>Income from work of €224 less €20 for each day worked up to a maximum of
€60 (3 days). 60% of the balance is assessed as means. </p>

<p>€224 - €60 = €164 </p>

<p>60% of €164 = €98 (rounded off) </p>

<p><strong></strong>Mary’s means are calculated as <strong>€98 </strong></p>

<p><strong>Note 2 </strong></p>

<p>John’s means from work for JA are calculated as follows: </p>

<p><strong>1. Calculate John’s average daily earnings: </strong></p>

<p>Get his total weekly assessable earnings from employment and divide by the
number of days he worked that week. </p>

<p>Total weekly earnings ÷ number of days worked = average daily earnings. </p>

<p>€100 ÷ 2 = €50</p>

<p><strong>2. Next calculate John’s daily means from work </strong></p>

<p>First disregard any income not taken into account. Income not taken into
account is €20 for each day worked up to a maximum of €60 (3 days). Then
60% of the balance is assessed as means. </p>

<p>Average daily earnings - €20 = total </p>

<p>Total x 60% = daily means from work. </p>

<p>€50 – €20 = 30 </p>

<p>30 x 60% = €18 </p>

<p><strong>3. Finally, find John’s weekly means from work </strong></p>

<p>Multiply his daily means by the number of days worked. </p>

<p>Daily means from work x number of days worked = weekly means from work. </p>

<p>€18 x 2 = €36 </p>

<p><strong></strong>John’s means are assessed as <strong>€36</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note 3 </strong></p>

<p><strong>Joint means are halved if</strong> spouse, civil partner or
cohabitant is:</p>
<ul><li>Getting a social welfare payment (except Child Benefit, Early Childcare
    Supplement, Disablement Pension, a guardian's payment, Supplementary
    Welfare Allowance, Domiciliary Care Allowance or half-rate Carer's
    Allowance)</li>
  <li>On a Further Education and Training (FET) course or on a VTOS course and
    getting an allowance in their own right</li>
</ul><p>Mary’s means from work is €98 – see ‘Note 1’ above. John’s means
from work is €36 – see ‘Note 2’ above. </p>

<p>In Assessments 3 and 4 the couples combined means is halved because both are
getting social welfare payments. In Assessment 3 Mary is getting FIS and John
is getting JA. In Assessment 4 Mary is getting JB and John is getting JA. </p>

<p>As a result, Mary’s means is €49 and John’s means is €18 for
Assessments 3 and 4. </p>

<p><strong>Note 4 </strong></p>

<p>Maximum payment rule: </p>

<p>If one of a couple is claiming Jobseeker's Allowance and the other is
getting of one of the social welfare payments listed below, <strong>the total
amount paid to the couple cannot exceed the maximum amount paid to one person
(including dependants) on one social welfare payment</strong>. However, you can
choose the higher-rate payment as the primary payment. </p>
<ul><li>Illness Benefit</li>
  <li>Disablement Pension (when paid with Illness Benefit or Incapacity
    Supplement)</li>
  <li>Injury Benefit</li>
  <li>Invalidity Pension</li>
  <li>State Pension (Non-Contributory)</li>
  <li>State Pension (Contributory)</li>
  <li>Jobseeker's Benefit</li>
  <li>Jobseeker's Allowance</li>
  <li>Pre-Retirement Allowance (PRETA)</li>
  <li>Farm Assist </li>
</ul><p>Where the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of a JA claimant is getting
JB, the Department of Social Protection assesses the maximum payment based on
the premise that the person is fully unemployed. This means, if the claimant is
getting a reduced JB (for example 2 days JB) because they are working, they
will be assessed as though they are getting full-rate JB. </p>

<p>In the case study above the maximum payment for the family is: Personal rate
+ IQA + IQC (full rate for 2 children) = maximum payment for the family </p>

<p>€193 + €128.10 + €59.60 = €380.70</p>

<p>In Assessment 4 of the case study, John’s JA payment and Mary’s JB
payment combined are less than the maximum payment for the family, as a result,
there is no change to John’s JA payment. </p>

<p>If Mary and John’s combined JA and JB payment was greater than the maximum
payment for the family, John’s JA payment would be reduced by the difference.

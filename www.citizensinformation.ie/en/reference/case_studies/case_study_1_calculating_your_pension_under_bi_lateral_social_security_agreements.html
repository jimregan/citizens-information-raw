study</h3>

<p>Peter is turning 66 years of age and wants to know if he will qualify for a
State Pension (Contributory). </p>

<p>Peter entered into insurable employment 40 years ago. He started his working
life in Ireland and worked in Ireland for 2 years in total. He has worked in
Ireland for the last 5 years and before that he worked in Germany for 23 years
and paid 1,196 contributions there. He doesn't have any breaks in his
employment record in Germany, that is, he worked in Germany continuously for 23
years immediately before coming back to Ireland. He therefore has 364 Irish
contributions and 1,196 German contributions. </p>

<p>Peter's wife Maria is 61 years of age, her only income is from work. She
earns €250 per week.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>

<p>Firstly you must check whether Peter would qualify for an Irish State
Pension based on his Irish contributions alone. </p>

<p>Peter's Irish contributions: 364</p>

<p>Total number of years worked (since entering into insurable employment to
the end of the last complete tax year before reaching pension age): 40 years</p>

<p>Total number of contributions by the number of years worked: 364 ÷ 40 =
9.1</p>

<p>Peter's yearly average number of contributions is 9.1. He would not qualify
for an Irish State Pension (Contributory).</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>

<p><strong></strong>Calculate Peter’s notional rate of pension. This is the
rate of State Pension (Contributory) Peter would be entitled to if all his
contributions were assessed as Irish contributions. </p>

<p>To calculate the notional rate of pension, find the total of all Peter’s
contributions (both foreign and Irish) divided by the number of years since he
entered into insurable employment to get his yearly average.</p>

<p>Total of all Peter's assessable contributions: 364 +1,196 = 1,560
contributions</p>

<p>Total number of years since entering into insurable employment to the end of
the last complete tax year before reaching pension age: 40 years</p>

<p>Total number of contributions by the number of years worked: 1,560 ÷ 40 =
39. </p>

<p>Peter's yearly average number of contributions is 39. </p>

<p>Peter's notional rate of pension is €209.70 (the rate paid in 2016 for
people with a yearly average of contributions between 30 and 39). </p>

<p>He is entitled to an increase in his payment for his wife. However, he is
not entitled to the maximum rate of increase for a qualified adult because she
is earning €250 per week. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Payments-for-retired-or-older-people.aspx">rate
of qualified adult increase payable is tapered for earnings between €100 and
€310</a>. The increase for his wife as a qualified adult is €59.40.</p>

<p><strong>Add</strong> Peter's rate of notional pension together with the
increase he gets for his wife: €209.70 + €59.40 = €269.10</p>

<p><strong>Total</strong> notional pension rate: €269.10</p>

<p><strong>Step 3<br></strong>Then apply the formula (A x B) ÷ C = rate of State Pension
(Contributory)</p>

<p>A = the notional rate of pension</p>

<p>B = the number of Irish contributions</p>

<p>C = total number of contributions (Irish and foreign)</p>

<p>You take the figure for the notional rate of pension and multiply by the
total number of Irish contributions: </p>

<p>€269.10 x 364 = €97,952</p>

<p>Next divide €97,952 by the total number of Irish and foreign contributions
which we calculated earlier to be 1,560: </p>

<p>€97,952 ÷ 1,560 = €62.79</p>

<p><strong>Peter’s rate of State Pension (Contributory) including an increase
for his wife as a qualified dependant is €62.79</strong></p>

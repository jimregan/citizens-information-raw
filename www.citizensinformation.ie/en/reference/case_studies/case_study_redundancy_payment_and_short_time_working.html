<p>Mary has worked for the same employer for the past 15 years. Two years ago
she was put on a three-day week on the understanding that this was temporary
and that full-time work would be resumed. She has now been told however that
she is to be made redundant. Over the years she has never received a pay
increase. How will her redundancy payment be calculated?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>

<p>Mary would be entitled to two weeks' pay for each year of service plus one
extra week's pay.<br>
The present ceiling (since 1 January 2005) on earnings is €600 per week
(previously €507 per week).</p>

<p>The payment would normally be calculated on her earnings at the time she is
let go. She had been working full-time for 13 years however before being put on
reduced working hours. That is, a three-day week. If she was made redundant
within one year of being put on reduced hours, her redundancy payment would be
based on her earnings for a full week. </p>

<p>In this case she is being made redundant having been on a three-day week for
more than a year. How her payment will be calculated depends on whether she
accepted being on reduced hours or not. If she fully accepted the reduced
working hours as her normal week and never asked to return to full-time work,
then her redundancy payment will be based on her gross pay for the reduced
working hours.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, she never accepted the reduced working hours as her
normal hours and continually asked to be put back on full-time working, then it
is clear she did not accept her reduced working hours as normal. In this
situation, her redundancy payment should be calculated based on her full-time
rate of pay.</p>

<p>If she had asked to be placed on reduced working hours for her own reasons
and the employer agreed, then the redundancy entitlement would based on the
reduced hours.</p>

<p>If she has a dispute about this with her employer she could make a claim to
the <a href="../../employment/enforcement_and_redress/labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace
Relations Commission</a> using the online complaint form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.

<h3>This is an example showing how income is assessed for Family Income
Supplement in 2017</h3>

<h3>Case study</h3>

<p>Mary has three children. Her youngest child is five years old. She is
getting a One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) and was recently offered work
part-time. If she takes the job, she will work three days each week and earn
€300. Mary wants to take the job as all of her children are now in school but
she knows her One-Parent Family Payment will be affected. </p>

<p>Would Mary be better off financially if she takes the job offer? She has
lived in her home for 20 years and has a small mortgage. She gets a weekly
maintenance payment of €80 for her mortgage costs which does not affect her
One-Parent Family Payment. Her 18-year-old daughter is a student has a
part-time job in a local shop. <br></p>

<p>Weekly net income from employment (See note 1) €300.00 </p>

<p><strong>Add</strong> Weekly net income from self-employment €0.00 </p>

<p><strong>Add</strong> reduced OFP (See note 2) €194.90 </p>

<p><strong>Add</strong> Income from occupational pensions €0.00 </p>

<p><strong>Add</strong> Maintenance received €80.00 </p>

<p>Total income €574.90 </p>

<p>The Family Income Supplement (FIS) maximum income limit for a family with
three children is €713. The difference between €713 and €574.90 is
€138.10. 60% of the difference (€138.10) is €82.86</p>

<p><strong>Mary will get a FIS payment of €83 (rounded up) each
week.</strong></p>

<p>Her current income is €362.40 (€282.40 OFP payment for herself and 3
children plus €80 maintenance).</p>

<p>If she takes the job her total gross income including FIS will be €657.90
(€194.90 OFP plus €83 FIS plus €300 income from work plus €80 from
maintenance).</p>

<h3>Note 1</h3>

<p>Mary’s net income from employment is assessed for FIS, however her
daughter’s income is <strong>not assessed</strong> because she is under 22
years of age and in full-time education.</p>

<h3>Note 2</h3>

<p>If Mary gets €300 from employment, her One-Parent Family Payment will be
reduced. (€110 of income from employment is disregarded and 50% of the
remaining €190 - which is €95 - is assessed as means). <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Jobseekers-supports.aspx">A person with
means of €95 gets an OFP payment of €105.50</a>. She gets €29.80 for each
child so her total payment will be €194.90.<br><a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">More
information is available about how income from employment affects your
One-Parent Family Payment</a>.</p>

	<h1>Case study: Minimum wage</h1>
	
<ul class="anchorlinks"></ul>
<div>
<p>Sean works 43 hours per week including three hours on a Saturday. He is
entitled to the minimum wage of €9.25 as he is an experienced adult employee
and isn't on a training or study course. He is paid a gross wage of €400 per
week. Sean's pay includes a €20 premium for working Saturdays. He asked his
employer about the national minimum wage and his employer gave him the
following information:</p>
<ul><li>The pay reference period is weekly </li>
  <li>Dividing the gross pay (€400) by the hours worked (43), this gives an
    average hourly pay of €9.30</li>
</ul><p>This is slightly above the current national minimum wage of €9.25 per
hour. Is Sean's employer correct?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong><br>
No, Sean's employer is incorrect. The €20 premium for working on Saturdays
should not be included for national minimum wage purposes. This means that only
€380 should be divided by 43, giving an average hourly pay of €8.84 - below
the national minimum wage of €9.25. </p>

<p>Sean's entitlement is a basic wage of €397.75 (€9.25 x 43) plus €20
Saturday premium which comes to a total of €417.75.</p>

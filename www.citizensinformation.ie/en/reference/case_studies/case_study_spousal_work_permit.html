<div>
<p>Alice came to Ireland from the Philippines with her husband who is employed
on a <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/green_card_permits.html">Critical
Skills Employment Permit.</a> She has been looking for work and found a
position in a local shop. The shop owner looked into getting an employment
permit for Alice but have told her that it is too expensive for them to
organise the employment permit for her. Alice was very disappointed and went to
her local Citizens Information Centre to get more information about employment
permits and her options. </p>

<p>In fact, because Aliceâ€™s husband is already working in Ireland on a
Critical Skills Employment Permit, Alice is eligible for a <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/spousal_work_permit_scheme.html">Dependant/Partner/Spousal
(DPS) Employment Permit.</a> There is no fee for this permit and the employer
does not have to advertise the role to see if an Irish or EEA citizen is
available. Alice told her potential employer this and they have applied for and
received a DPS Employment Permit for Alice. Now that Alice is working, <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/">employment
protection legislation</a> applies to her in the same way that it applies to
all other workers in Ireland. <br></p>

	<h1>Case study: Claiming constructive dismissal</h1>
	
<ul class="anchorlinks"></ul>
<div>
<p>Jean worked as the area manager of a company for 10 years. Brian worked as
the accountant of the company. Three years ago, Jean went on <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/maternity_leave.html">maternity
leave</a> and after she returned to work, she found that many of her
responsibilities were being gradually removed and given to Brian. Jean claimed
her position was intolerable. <br><br>
She contacted her manager to complain and was assured her responsibilities
would soon be transferred back to her and that her work situation would return
to normal. When there was no improvement in the situation, she wrote to the
manager again. Her letter said that unless she received a reply within 7 days
confirming her functions and responsibilities as area manager were the same as
before, she would consider herself constructively dismissed and leave her
employment. <br><br>
Jean then made a claim for constructive dismissal against her employer but was
her claim successful?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>

<p>The Employment Appeals Tribunal decided that the company had appointed Brian
as joint area manager without consultation or notice to Jean and this conduct
had undermined the relationship of confidence and trust between her and the
company. The Tribunal found that it reasonable that she found this undermining
of her confidence and trust in her. The managing director had failed to
communicate with her to reassure her about her position and to maintain the
relationship of confidence and trust. </p>

<p>This conduct indicated that the company no longer intended to be bound by
the terms of her contract as area manager. Therefore she was entitled to
terminate her employment because of the conduct of her employer and was
<em>constructively dismissed</em>. <br></p>

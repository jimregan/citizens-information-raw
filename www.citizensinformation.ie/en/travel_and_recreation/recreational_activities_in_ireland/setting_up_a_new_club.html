<p>If you are considering setting up a club, such as a sports club, there are 3
important issues that need to be considered:</p>
<ul><li>Are there enough potential members?</li>
  <li>Are there enough volunteers to run the club?</li>
  <li>Is there another club in the area that is already meeting the need for
    such a club?</li>
</ul><p>If there is a national governing body (NGB) for the sport or activity you
should contact it for advice.</p>

<p>Once there is a general agreement to set up a club there will be a number of
things that will need to be decided and agreed on.</p>

<h3>Club structure</h3>

<p>One of the first things that will have to be decided on is what is the best
legal structure to use for the club. The most common and simplest structure for
a club is an unincorporated association and is the one this document assumes is
being used.</p>

<p>It involves drawing up a set of rules, known as its constitution, to
regulate the relationship between the members of the club and it usually
provides for a committee to run the club's affairs. However, under this
structure the club has no separate legal personality and the members are
personally liable for the actions or debts of the club. If the club wishes to
employ staff or lease property, it may find that an unincorporated association
is too limited a structure for this.</p>

<p>Sport Ireland provides information on the <a href="http://www.irishsportscouncil.ie/Governing_Bodies/NGB_Support_Kit/">various
types of legal structures</a> there are, along with the advantages and
disadvantages of each type, in the NGB Support Kit on its website.</p>

<h3>Club name</h3>

<p>A club name is necessary in order to draw up formal documents and to open a
bank account. The name can be anything you decide but you should check to make
sure that no other local club has the same name.</p>

<h3>Club constitution</h3>

<p>The club constitution is a written document that states the rules and
structures that govern the club. It outlines the functions of the club and the
procedures for membership, meetings and committees. A club constitution is
usually required for funding and if applying for tax relief.</p>

<p>If there is a national governing body, it may be able to provide you with a
model constitution which you could adapt. Sports clubs often have copies of
their constitutions on their websites. You can find <a href="https://www.charitiesregulatoryauthority.ie/en/CRA/Pages/WP16000065">guidance
on constitutions</a> on the Charities Regulator website.</p>

<h3>Club officials</h3>

<p>A club needs a number of officials to run the club. The minimum requirement
is:</p>
<ul><li>Chairperson</li>
  <li>Secretary</li>
  <li>Treasurer</li>
</ul><p>These are elected posts and the holders are members of the club committee.
There can be other members on the committee as laid out in the club’s
constitution such as:</p>
<ul><li>Child Protection Officer*</li>
  <li>Fundraising Officer</li>
</ul><p>A club can have other roles outside of formal club positions that people in
the club may volunteer to carry out.</p>

<p>* Under the <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/Publications/ChildrenFirst.pdf">child
protection guidelines</a> operated by the Department of Children and Youth
Affairs, it is good practice for all organisations that have contact with
children and young people to introduce a child protection policy.</p>

<h3>Annual general meeting</h3>

<p>An annual general meeting (AGM) is held each year as laid down in the club
constitution so that all members can have an input into the running of the
club. It is at the AGM that the club committee is elected.</p>

<h3>Committee meetings</h3>

<p>The club committee is the group of members who are formally responsible for
managing the club. Establishing a committee with clearly identified roles can
help to identify who does what in the club and can help to spread the workload.
The committee should meet several times a year at a minimum. Information on a
code of practice for good governance of community, voluntary and charitable
organisations is available at <a href="http://www.governancecode.ie/">governancecode.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>

<p>Funds to run the club will have to be raised. Initially these funds are
likely to come from membership subscriptions. It is also advisable to produce a
list of costs to run the club throughout the year. This will help in creating a
budget of income and expenditure for the next 12 months.</p>

<p>A bank account in the name of the club will be required. The bank will
usually ask for two signatories for the withdrawal of cash or signing of
cheques.</p>

<p>The Treasurer must maintain either:</p>
<ul><li>A bound account book for recording details of the financial affairs of
    the club or</li>
  <li>A computer programme from which printouts can be made in the format of an
    account book. Appropriate back-up arrangements should be made to avoid
    irretrievable loss of data</li>
</ul><p>All monies and cheques received should be paid into the club bank account,
recorded in the account book and, for cash received, a receipt issued. The
accounts may have to be audited each year.</p>

<p>There is a scheme of tax relief on income for certain eligible charities and
other approved bodies, including sporting bodies. Information on tax relief for
<a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/gs1.pdf">sporting bodies
(Leaflet GS 1) (pdf)</a> and for <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/chy1.pdf">charities (Leaflet CHY
1) (pdf)</a> is available on <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/index.html">Revenue’s
website</a>.</p>

<h3>Insurance</h3>

<p>As an unincorporated association, the club members are personally liable for
the actions or debts of the club. Therefore, the club should obtain adequate
insurance to cover its members. It should have suitable public liability
insurance and professional indemnity insurance for its activities. Advice on
insurance may be available from the national governing body, if there is
one.</p>

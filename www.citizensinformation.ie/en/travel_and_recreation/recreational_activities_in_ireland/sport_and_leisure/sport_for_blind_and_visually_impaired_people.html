<h3>Vision Sports Ireland</h3>

<p>Vision Sports Ireland (formerly Irish Blind Sports) is the national
governing body in Ireland for sporting activities for blind and visually
impaired people. The organisation was founded in 1989 to encourage the
participation in sport by blind and visually impaired people at all levels. The
organisation has an executive committee and a constitution that outlines the
rules and guidelines under which the activities are undertaken. Funding for
Vision Sports Ireland comes from the Sport Ireland. </p>

<p>Sports are conducted at all levels (including elite). Each sport undertaken
by the organisation has its own principal co-ordinator who is responsible for
promoting and organising activities within that sport. In recent years, the
organisation has significantly expanded the <a href="http://www.visionsports.ie/Sports.aspx">range of sports</a> it has become
involved in. </p>

<p>Membership consists of people of all ages, backgrounds and sporting ability
(including elite athletes). Sighted people can also become members of the
organisation. </p>

<h3>Volunteers, coaches and guides</h3>

<p>In addition to being participants in sport, sighted members frequently act
as guides and volunteers. Volunteers, coaches and guides form an integral part
of Vision Sports Ireland. </p>

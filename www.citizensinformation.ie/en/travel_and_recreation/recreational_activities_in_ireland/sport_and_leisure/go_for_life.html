<h3>Go for Life</h3>

<p>Go for Life is the national programme for sport and physical activity for
older people. The aim of Go for Life is to involve greater numbers of older
adults in all aspects of sport and physical activity. It is run by Age &amp;
Opportunity in partnership with the <a href="https://www.healthpromotion.ie/health/health_promotion/">Health Promotion
and Improvement Offices</a> of the <a href="../../../health/health_service_agencies/health_boards.html">Health
Service Executive (HSE)</a> and the <a href="http://www.irishsportscouncil.ie/Participation/">Local Sports
Partnerships</a>.</p>

<p>The Go for Life programme has 4 different elements:</p>
<ul><li>Leadership Programme</li>
  <li>Targeted initiatives</li>
  <li>National Grant Scheme</li>
  <li>Physical Activity Awareness Programme</li>
</ul><h3>Leadership Programme</h3>

<p>The Leadership Programme aims to promote greater participation by
independent older people in all aspects of health-enhancing physical activity
and recreational sports. Go for Life tutors are available to train local
physical activity leaders (PAL) in physical activity with older people. PALs
tend to be members of community groups, such as <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/retirement/retirement_from_work/active_retirement.html">active
retirement</a> associations or <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/health_services_for_people_with_disabilities/day_centres.html">day
centre</a> workers. Around the country, there are over 1,200 active PALs.</p>

<h3>Targeted initiatives</h3>

<p>The targeted initiatives promote greater participation by dependent or
disadvantaged older people. </p>

<h3>National Grant Scheme</h3>

<p>The National Grant Scheme for Sport and Physical Activity for Older People
is a government initiative aimed at encouraging older members of the community
to participate in sport and physical activity.</p>

<p>The scheme is aimed at:</p>
<ul><li>Helping clubs and organisations to enhance existing opportunities for
    their members in recreational sport and activities </li>
  <li>Helping clubs and organisations to progress new initiatives geared at
    involving older people in recreational sport and activities </li>
</ul><p>Applications for funding under the National Grant Scheme are usually invited
from local clubs and organisations wishing to implement initiatives, through
advertisements in the press and media. </p>

<h3>Physical Activity Awareness Programme</h3>

<p>The Physical Activity Awareness Programme aims to increase older peopleâ€™s
awareness of the benefits of an active lifestyle and of the wide range of
opportunities for involvement in active living and recreational sport. </p>

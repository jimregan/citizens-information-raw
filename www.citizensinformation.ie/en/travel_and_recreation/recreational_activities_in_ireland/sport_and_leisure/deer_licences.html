<p>Deer are a protected species in Ireland under the terms of the Wildlife Act,
1976 (as amended) and it is a serious offence to hunt them without a licence.
The wild deer population in Ireland, which consists of red, fallow, sika,
muntjac and hybrid deer, is managed by conservation rangers employed by the
National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS). The NPWS is part of the Department
of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. </p>

<p>Applications for deer hunting licences are processed by the NPWS. Licences
are issued free of charge, subject to compliance with certain rules. </p>

<p>The number of wild deer hunting licences issued by the NPWS varies from year
to year, depending on demand, and the management of the deer population. The
open season in Ireland also varies from year to year depending on the location
and species of deer. Outside of the open hunting season, landowners can apply
for a Section 42 licence to control deer on their lands if damage is being
caused. </p>

<p>The following is the open season for deer in Ireland:</p>

<p>If you wish to hunt deer on another person's land, you must show evidence of
permission from the landowner when you apply for your licence. The land must
total a minimum of 100 acres (42 hectares).</p>

<p>You can apply for a licence during the open or closed season but you can
only hunt deer when permitted. </p>

<p>You must supply your firearm (gun) details when applying for a licence. The
legal minimum requirement for a firearm to hunt deer is at least .220/.250
calibre which uses bullets of no less than 60 grain weight. All firearms in

<p>Your local police may require you provide evidence of adequate security in
your home, land folio numbers if this weapon is to be discharged on your land
and a deer hunting licence before they issue you with a firearms certificate.

<p>There is no charge for deer hunting licences. </p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You can apply for a deer hunting licence for the upcoming season from the
end of April, however, the licence can not be issued until August.</p>

<p>To get your licence in time for the new season you must apply before the end
of June and it is advisable to apply as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Complete the <a shape="rect" href="https://www.npws.ie/sites/default/files/files/deer-hunting-application-form-2017.doc">Application
for a Licence to Hunt Deer</a> form which is available from the National Parks
and Wildlife Service. If you do not intend to shoot on your own land, you must
also supply written evidence of permission from the landowner allowing you to
hunt on his/ her lands that hold deer. You will also have to supply the folio
number of the lands. Folio numbers can be obtained from the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.prai.ie/#contactDiv">Land Registry Service of the Property
Registration Authority</a>.</p>

<p>Applications are only considered on receipt of a fully completed application
form and, if granted, are valid for the hunting season in a particular year.
The application form is issued to existing licence holders each April. </p>

<p>Your application will be examined by the National Parks and Wildlife
Service, together with the landowner's permission. If you were issued with a
deer hunting licence in the previous year, details of the deer you shot (bag
returns) are sought on the application form for each applicant. Conservation
rangers throughout the country employed by National Parks and Wildlife Service
ensure that hunters have appropriate deer hunting licences. Rangers also
examine new licence applications. </p>

<p>It is your responsibility to ensure that you have the appropriate deer
hunting licence and a firearm of the appropriate calibre. You will be
prosecuted for hunting deer with an inappropriate firearm or by any other
means. </p>

<p>The Blue Flag is an international environmental award made to beaches and
marinas thoughout the world that demonstrate good environmental standards and
good sanitary and safety facilities. The award is made by the Foundation for
Environmental Education (FEE), an independent non-profit organisation. The Blue
Flag award is in place in <a href="http://www.blueflag.org/">over 45 countries
internationally</a>. You can find information on the beaches and marinas in
Ireland that have received awards at <a href="http://www.blueflagireland.org/">blueflagireland.org</a>.</p>

<p>In Ireland, the Blue Flag is operated by <a shape="rect" href="http://www.antaisce.ie/">An Taisce</a>. An Taisce also operates a <a shape="rect" href="http://cleancoasts.org/homepage/">Green Coast Award</a>
scheme for beaches that meet <a shape="rect" href="http://www.epa.ie/water/wm/bathing/">EU bathing water quality
standards</a> but also retain their natural, unspoilt environment. You can find
out the water quality at Ireland's designated bathing areas at <a shape="rect" href="http://splash.epa.ie/#">splash.epa.ie</a>. There is a <a href="http://www.blueflagireland.org/home/blue-flag-app.1467.html">Blue Flag

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>A Blue Flag award is awarded to a beach or marina for one season (July to
August) only. </p>

<p>The award of a Blue Flag to a beach depends on compliance with 32 criteria
covering the following aspects:</p>
<ul><li>Water quality </li>
  <li>Environmental education and information </li>
  <li>Environmental management </li>
  <li>Safety and services </li>
</ul><p>There are 24 criteria that a marina must comply with. They cover the same
areas of water quality, environmental education and information, environmental
management, safety and services. A marina can be part of a larger harbour with
other activities, if it is clearly separated from other harbour activities.</p>

<p>The criteria <span>must be adhered to</span> in order to gain a Blue Flag.
If the criteria are not fulfilled during the season or the conditions change,
the Blue Flag may be withdrawn. </p>

<p>The Blue Flag criteria are minimum criteria. A country can choose to have
stricter criteria.</p>

<p>You can view the <a href="http://www.blueflagireland.org/criteria/beaches.1169.html">Blue Flag
beach criteria</a> and the <a href="http://www.blueflagireland.org/criteria/marinas.1170.html">Blue Flag
marina criteria</a> on the blueflagireland.org website. </p>

The local authority in question files the application form (with enclosed
documentation) and sends it to the National Jury. For applications for beaches,
approved bathing water data from the previous year has to be submitted as
documentation together with the application as well. </p>

<p>The marina owner is responsible for applying for a Blue Flag award for a
marina</p>

<p>To be eligible for the Blue Flag a beach/marina has to fulfill all
imperative requirements, and in addition, the fulfillment of a maximum number

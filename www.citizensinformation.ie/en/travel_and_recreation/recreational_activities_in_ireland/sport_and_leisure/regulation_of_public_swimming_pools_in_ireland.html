<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>Public swimming pools in Ireland are provided to the public and maintained
by <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/local_and_regional_government/local_authorities.html">local
authorities</a>. Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0037/index.html">Local
Government Act, 2001</a>, the provision of recreational facilities such as
swimming pools is a function of local authorities. Although this does not
compel a local authority to provide a swimming pool, in practice there is at
least one public swimming pool in most local authority areas. </p>

<p>The Government provides capital grants to local authorities to build and
renovate public swimming pools. The current scheme in operation is the <a href="http://www.dttas.ie/sport/projects/swimming_pool.aspx">Local Authority
Swimming Pool Programme</a>, which is managed by the Department of Transport,
Tourism and Sport. The closing date for applications for the current programme
was July 2000. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Water quality</h3>

<p>All bathing areas in Ireland must meet the quality standards set out in <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1429714342971&amp;uri=URISERV:co0018">Directive
2006/7/EC on Bathing Waters</a> implemented by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2008/en/si/0079.html">Bathing Water
Quality Regulations 2008 (SI 79 of 2008)</a>. Transitional measures are in
place until the 2008 Regulations are fully implemented in 2015.</p>

<p>The legislation applies to freshwater and seawater bathing areas. It does
not include swimming pools. The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local
Government, through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is responsible
for <a href="http://epa.ie/water/wm/bathing/">monitoring the quality of water
in all public bathing water areas</a>. Swimming pools are not currently subject
to any statutory quality requirements. </p>

<p>The EPA has to ensure that all freshwater and seawater areas where citizens
may swim conform to a minimum water quality standard, as set out in the
directive. Each State is required to retest their freshwater and seawater areas
at regular intervals. The EPA report for 2011 indicated that 98.5% of bathing
areas around Ireland were up to EU minimum standards. </p>

<h3>Water safety</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.iws.ie/">Irish Water Safety</a> is the
statutory body that deals with water safety and swimming rescue. The
organisation is financed by a combination of Government, local authority and
private funding. Its function is to promote water safety in Ireland by
providing information, running lifesaving training courses and advising local
authorities. </p>

<p>Each local authority has a water safety development officer. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.iws.ie/structure/area-contacts.212.html">Contact details for
each water safety development officer in the country</a> are available from
Irish Water Safety. </p>

<p>Public amenities such as swimming pools are required to have fire exits and
a designated place of assembly, often the car park outside, under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1985/en/si/0249.html">Fire
Safety in Places of Assembly Regulations 1985</a> . </p>

<h3>Lifeguarding</h3>

<p>Anyone over 16 years of age who is a competent swimmer can join a course to
become a qualified lifeguard. To work as a lifeguard in a swimming pool, you
must have an Irish Water Safety Pool Lifeguard Award, which is given to people
who complete the Irish Water Safety Pool Lifeguard examination and to those who
complete the Lifeguarding training offered by Quality and Qualifications
Ireland. </p>

<p>The Irish Water Safety course requires a minimum of 24 hours of lessons in
resuscitation, water safety and life guarding to be completed. To get the
award, candidates must then pass two physical examinations and a written
examination. Irish Water Safety also has <a shape="rect" href="http://www.iws.ie/events.169.html">details of water safety courses
currently running in each county</a> on its website.</p>

<p>Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) is the national awards agency that
certifies vocational courses run in local education centres around the country
by local <a href="http://www.etbi.ie/">Education and Training Boards (ETB)</a>.
Through QQI, some local VECs offer foundation modules in Swimming and in Water
Safety, but to be certified as a lifeguard, candidates must complete the Water
Safety module and two further modules called Swimming and Water Safety (a level
one module) and Lifeguarding (a level two module). The third module is similar
in content to the Irish Water Safety course. Candidates for the Lifeguarding
module must be competent swimmers and must have already completed the
foundation module and the Level 1 module, be certified with the Irish Water
Safety's Rescue 2 Award or have relevant life experience. Candidates are
assessed by skills demonstration and a theoretical examination and are then
given a pass, merit or distinction grade. Candidates who complete the Level 2
module receive a certificate and are also automatically awarded with
certification as a lifeguard from Irish Water Safety.</p>

<h3>Hygiene</h3>

<p>There is no statutory provision for monitoring hygiene and water quality in
private swimming pools. Ireland Active and An Taisce run a voluntary <a shape="rect" href="white_flag_recreational_facilities_in_ireland.html">White
Flag Award scheme</a> that seeks to promote high quality leisure facilities,
including swimming pools. The criteria for the award include quality of access,
hygiene, safety, environmental policy, indoor and outdoor facilities, water
quality and information and education. </p>

<h3>Swimming classes</h3>

<p>Most public swimming pools and many private swimming pools offer courses in
swimming for swimmers of all levels, ability and ages. For details of courses
in your area, contact your local authority to find out where your nearest
swimming pool is and what classes and courses are on offer. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Grant funding for the construction or refurbishment of swimming pools is
subject to a maximum award of 3.8 million euro and may not exceed 80 per cent
of the total cost of the application. In certain disadvantaged areas, funding
of up to 90 per cent is available. </p>

<p>The grants are available for building or updating a swimming pool, toddler
pool, sauna and steam room. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<h3>Public Authority Swimming Pool Programme </h3>

<p>Applications under the Public Authority Swimming Pool Programme are made to
the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport by local authorities. Civil
groups such as sports clubs can also apply for funding under the scheme. </p>

<p>If a project to build a swimming pool is planned by an organisation other
than a local authority, that organisation must first apply to its local
authority for approval. Before the local authority can support such a project,
it must be satisfied that the balance of funding is available and that the
project when completed will have a satisfactory level of access available to
the general public. There is no specific definition of what a satisfactory
level of access is, but in practice, most local authorities would try to have a
lower entrance fee than local private pools to facilitate greater public
access. </p>

<p>The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport gives approval to
applications that comply with the Department's Procedures for the Planning,
Approval and Financing of Swimming Pools and Technical Guidelines. This means
that the proposals for a pool must satisfy a number of conditions. These
include:</p>
<ul><li>The need for a swimming pool in the area </li>
  <li>The suitability of the site where the applicant authority wants to build
    the pool </li>
  <li>The future viability of the pool, in particular whether there will be
    enough money available to cover the pool's operation and maintenance costs
  </li>
  <li>The construction and operating standards of the proposed project in
    comparison to existing facilities </li>
  <li>A satisfactory financial plan </li>
  <li>The need to achieve an even spread of grant awards around the country.
  </li>
</ul><p>If an application is approved, the project will be completed in four stages.
These stages are the Preliminary Report Stage, the Contract Document Stage, the
Tender Stage and the Construction Stage. Technical advisors from the Office of
Public Works (OPW) supervise each project and the OPW's approval is required
before a pool project can proceed from one stage to the next. </p>

<h3>Making a complaint</h3>

<p>If you want to complain about the lack of a swimming pool in your area or
about the standard or condition of swimming facilities in your area, you should
first contact your local authority to find out who processes complaints in that
local authority. </p>

<p>Most local authorities have a complaints officer or customer care officer
who deals with complaints. Within a few days of sending a letter, you will
receive a notice in the post confirming that the local authority has received
your complaint. A decision on your complaint will then be made within four
weeks. </p>

<p>If you are not happy with the decision, you can write back to the local
authority and request a review of your case. If you are not happy with the
outcome of this appeal, you can take your case to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/office_of_the_ombudsman.html">Office
of the Ombudsman</a>, whose decision is final. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l07de2">Introduction </h2>

<p>Public libraries are open to everyone. You do not have to be a member of the
library if you just want to read something in the library, ask a question or
consult a reference work (for example, a telephone directory or a dictionary or
an encyclopaedia).</p>

<p>You will, however, need to join the library if you want to borrow books or
other items or, in most cases, if you want to use the internet.</p>

<p>There are differences in the services particular libraries provide,
depending on the size and location of the branch and on the policies of the
library service.</p>

<h3>Lending services</h3>

<p>All public libraries provide books which can be borrowed by members of the
library. All kinds of books can be borrowed, fiction (such as the latest
bestseller or a classic novel) and non-fiction (such as history, biography,
science, travel or self-help). In addition to standard books, libraries also
have many books in large print format, which are popular with readers with a
visual impairment.</p>

<h3>Children's lending service</h3>

<p>In most libraries there are adult and junior sections. Children up to a
certain age use the junior section only which provides books and other
materials especially for children. Books for children of all ages, from babies
up to teenagers are available in the junior library.</p>

<h3>Reserves and requests</h3>

<p>If the book you want is already out on loan, you can reserve it. The library
will notify you when the book is available for you to borrow.</p>

<p>If the library does not have the book you want, you can request it, again by
filling in a form. The library may purchase the book or may look for a copy
through the <em>inter-library loan</em> system. This is a system through which
libraries in Ireland, the UK, and around the world, loan items to each other
for the use of library members.</p>

<h3>Other materials</h3>

<p>In addition to books, in most libraries you can borrow audio-books, which
are recorded readings of books. Books of all kinds are available on recording
and they come on both cassettes and CDs. In some libraries you can borrow
ebooks.</p>

<p>In many libraries you can borrow compact discs and cassettes of music. These
range from popular chart music to traditional and classical music.</p>

<p>Some libraries have selections of prints and paintings which can also be
borrowed.</p>

<h3>Magazines and newspapers</h3>

<p>Public libraries carry a range of journals and periodicals including
national and local newspapers and magazines on a variety of topics (for
example, business, health and lifestyle, gardening, science, nature,
history).</p>

<h3>Reference and general information services</h3>

<p>All public libraries have <em>reference</em> sections, containing books and
other materials which can be consulted in the library. Reference sections
typically include resources such as dictionaries, directories, encyclopaedias,
government publications, business information, yearbooks and atlases. Some
reference material, in particular business-related material, is available on CD
or over the internet.</p>

<p>Public libraries can also provide contact details and information on the
services provided by the county council or corporation and by government
departments, for example, social welfare information.</p>

<p>Most libraries also hold a lot of local information about clubs and
societies and events in their locality.</p>

<h3>Local studies</h3>

<p>All public libraries collect materials about the history of their county or
locality. There is a huge range of material available including county and
parish histories, maps, photographs, drawings, old records, and newspapers. In
some cases the main local history collection will be in the county library so
you should check this at your local branch.</p>

<h3>Internet services</h3>

<p>All public library services now have computers which the public can use to
access the internet. In most cases you must be a member of the library to use
the computers. Usually you will have to book a session in advance but you
should check this in your local branch. Many libraries now offer introductory
sessions for new users.</p>

<p>Individual library catalogues can be searched online by author, title or
keyword. The system is accessed using library borrower number and a personal
identification number (PIN). In addition, it is possible to request a book,
renew loans and check borrower information such as loans and reservations
online.</p>

<p>Online access to digitised content from public libraries is available
through, for example, <a href="http://www.askaboutireland.ie/">askaboutireland.ie</a>. Through the <a href="http://www.borrowbooks.ie/">BorrowBooks</a> service, library members can
borrow items from across the public library authorities via their local library
service. All public libraries are becoming part of <a href="http://www.librariesireland.ie/">Libraries Ireland</a> which will allow
anyone with a public library card borrow and reserve items from any public
library. Ebooks and eaudio books can be borrowed via the <a href="https://librariesireland.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/19000076578">BorrowBox</a>
service.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="http://www.housing.gov.ie/local-government/community-services/public-libraries/online-services">more
information on online services</a> on the Department of Housing, Planning,
Community and Local Government website.</p>

<h3>Self-directed learning</h3>

<p>Many public libraries, particularly the larger ones, <a href="http://www.housing.gov.ie/local-government/community-services/public-libraries/learning-library">provide
resources to enable users learn</a> or follow a course of study themselves.
These include learning packs, online learning modules, learning booths,
training materials and short courses. Ask for details at your local branch.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Anyone can use and/or join their public library.</p>

<p>The number of items you can borrow at any one time and the length of time
you may keep them varies. You should ask for details at your local library.</p>

<p>You may need to book some services, such as language learning or the
internet in advance.</p>

<p>Children may only borrow items from the junior library. The age at which
young people may use the adult library varies so you should check this at your
local library.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Although most services in most public libraries are free, there are some
charges which you may have to pay. Some libraries have a small membership
charge and most levy fines for the late return of books or other borrowed
items. There is usually a small charge for reservations or requests. Ask at
your local library for details. All public libraries charge for
photocopying.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>Some requirements will vary, depending on the library service, but the
following apply to most, if not all, library services:</p>
<ul><li>In order to join the library you need to fill out an application form at
    any branch.</li>
  <li>You must produce some proof of your identity and of your address.</li>
  <li>If you are under 18 years of age you will have to have get someone aged
    over 18 (for example, a parent or guardian) to sign as a guarantor.</li>
  <li>Each library service issues its own library card which can only be used
    in the branches of that library service. If you want to use the branches of
    more than one library service then you need to be a member of each of them.
    If, for example, you want to use the libraries run by Dublin City Council
    and by Fingal County Council, you must become a member of both.</li>

<p>Angling is regulated by <a shape="rect" href="http://www.fisheriesireland.ie/">Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI)</a>, a
State body established in July 2010 following the amalgamation of the Central
Fisheries Board and the seven former Regional Fisheries Boards into a single
agency. The main function of Inland Fisheries Ireland is to advise the Minister
on policy relating to the conservation, protection, management, development and
improvement of inland fisheries and sea angling. It ensures that national and
local fisheries laws are observed in both inland waterways and out to the 12
mile fishing limit off the coast. It also ensures that Ireland's fisheries
resources are protected and conserved. </p>

<p>Angling in Ireland is divided into the following categories: <a shape="rect" href="http://www.fishinginireland.info/coarse/index.htm">coarse</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.fishinginireland.info/salmon/index.htm">game</a>,
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.fishinginireland.info/sea/index.htm">sea</a>,
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.fishinginireland.info/pike/index.htm">pike</a>, and <a shape="rect" href="http://www.fishinginireland.info/trout/index.htm">river
trout</a>. Protected fisheries species in Ireland include salmon, sea trout,
sea bass, molluscs, eels and all freshwater fish. State licences are required
in order to fish for salmon or sea trout in any part of Ireland. </p>

<h3>Fish farms</h3>

<p>One of the effects of water pollution, fish kills and other problems is that
fish populations in inland waterways can be affected. The IFI has a fish stock
management programme in place to restore fish populations in affected areas.
Fish stock mangement has also been used to enhance the status of fisheries and
to address issues such as protection and conservation of species. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.fisheriesireland.ie/Fish-Farm/fishfarm.html">Read
more about fish farms in Ireland</a> here. </p>

<h3>Protection of resources</h3>

<p>Inland Fisheries Ireland, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.military.ie/en/naval-service/">Irish Naval Service</a>, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.military.ie/en/air-corps/">Aer Corps</a> and an
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.garda.ie/">Garda Siochana</a> are all involved
in the protection of Irish inland and sea fishery resources. Under a national
patrol plan all protection and surveillance operations are co-ordinated. </p>

<p>The aim of the patrol and surveillance services is to create a deterrant to
illegal activity by ensuring maximum visible presence in waters and to
prosecute offencers and confiscate illegal nets, equipment, tackle and catch.
</p>

<h3>Tagging and logging salmon catches</h3>

<p>A system of tagging and recording details of all commercial and recreational
salmon catches in Ireland was introduced in 2000. This system of tagging and
recording details of salmon caught is similar to systems in place in Canada,
France, Spain and in the US. The tagging scheme provides valuable catch
statistics and estimations of stocks on rivers. </p>

<p>All salmon (and sea trout over 40cm) kept must be tagged and the logbook
filled out accordingly. You are required to return your completed logbook and
any unused tags by the 19th October of the relevant year. Even if you did not
fish or catch any fish, you <span>must return your logbook and tags</span>.
Further information on the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.fishinginireland.info/salmon/salmontagging.htm">Salmon and Sea
Trout Tagging Scheme</a> is available on Inland Fisheries Ireland's angling
website <a shape="rect" href="http://www.fishinginireland.info/">fishinginireland.info</a>. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>
<ul><li>The majority of waters in Ireland are owned either privately or are owned
    by the State. A fishing permit issued by the owner of the waterway gives
    you the right to fish for varying periods ranging from a day to a season.
  </li>
  <li>The only legal way to catch freshwater fish in Ireland is by rod and
    line. It is illegal for one person to use more than two rods at a time.
  </li>
  <li>It is illegal to use live fish as bait. </li>
  <li>You must obtain a State Fishing licence, tags and a separate fishing
    permit in order to fish for salmon and sea trout. Prices and duration of
    permits will vary. (See how to apply). </li>
  <li>Most fisheries close on 30 September each year (with a few exceptions
    that close on various dates between 15 September and 12 October). Check
    with <a href="http://www.fisheriesireland.ie/About-Us/contact-us.html">your
    local IFI office</a> for further information. </li>
  <li>It is illegal to keep or kill any sea trout in Connemara (western
    Ireland) or the Ballinakill district (above Connemara). </li>
  <li>It is illegal to sell rod-caught salmon or sea trout over 40cm between 1
    January and 31 October in any year. </li>
  <li>On some waters, "fly-only" regulations or other restrictions may in
    place. Check with the owner of the waterway or your local Fisheries
    District Office for more information. </li>
</ul><p>More <a shape="rect" href="http://www.fishinginireland.info/regulations.htm">information on fishing

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>A State Licence is required to fish for salmon and sea trout. You can
purchase a licence for a period of one day up to a licence for a year.
Information on the range of licences available and their cost is available on
Inland Fisheries Ireland's angling website where you can also <a shape="rect" href="http://www.fishinginireland.info/salmon/salmon_licence.htm">purchase the
licence online</a>.</p>

<p>While a licence is required to fish for salmon and sea trout it does not
entitle you to fish. Fishing permits or permission from fisheries owners is
also usually required and must be obtained separately. In general, a fishing
permit costs from €20 to €50 a day.</p>

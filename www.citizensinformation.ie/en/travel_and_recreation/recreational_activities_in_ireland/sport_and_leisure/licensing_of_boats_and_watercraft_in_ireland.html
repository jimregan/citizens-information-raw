<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>Recreational boats in Ireland are regulated in different ways depending on
their size and what they are used for. The use of safety equipment is governed
by different laws for commercial, fishing and private vessels. Age restrictions
apply to the use of certain mechanically propelled pleasure craft such as
jet-skis and the consumption of alcohol or drugs while using these craft is
also restricted. Sailing is governed by the Irish Sailing Association, which
offers details of courses in sailing around Ireland. If a person owns a boat
and wishes to install radio equipment on it, he or she must apply for a licence
and may have to sit a radio operation examination. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Safety equipment</h3>

<p>Safety regulations governing the use of boats are specific to different
kinds of vessel. Every shipping vessel, regardless of size, must carry
lifejackets/personal flotation devices for each person on board. </p>

<p>Everyone on board a vessel of less than 23 feet (7.0 metres) in length must
wear a lifejacket/personal flotation device. </p>

<h3>Passenger ships licensed to carry more than 12 people</h3>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0002/index.html">Merchant
Shipping Act 1992</a>, passenger ships that are licensed to carry more than 12
people are required to pass an annual safety inspection carried out by the
Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. </p>

<h3>Fishing vessels</h3>

<p>The use of safety equipment on fishing boats is regulated by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/si/0586.html">Fishing
Vessel (Personal Flotation Devices) Regulations, 2001</a>. The Regulations
state that a lifejacket or personal flotation device must be provided for every
crew member on any fishing vessel registered and licensed in Ireland. The crew
members must wear a lifejacket or personal flotation device at all times when
on an exposed deck or at all times on open vessels that do not have internal
accommodation. This applies equally whether the boat is at sea, in harbour or
coming to and from moorings. Each lifejacket or personal flotation device
should be marked with the initials "CE" to show that it complies with a 1996 EU
Directive on marine safety equipment standards or is marked with the mark of
conformity in the form of the symbol set out in the 1996 Directive on marine
equipment. </p>

<h3>Pleasure craft</h3>

<p>Under the Merchant Shipping Act 1992, as amended by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0014/index.html">Merchant
Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000</a>, a pleasure craft is
defined as any vessel in private ownership used wholly or mainly for sport and
recreation purposes. It also covers private vessels that are hired out by third
parties, provided that the vessel will be operated only by the hirers and will
not require a crew to operate it. </p>

<h3>Mechanically Propelled Pleasure Craft</h3>

<p>The use of safety equipment on any mechanically-propelled pleasure craft is
covered by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/si/0921.html">Pleasure Craft
(Personal Flotation Devices and Operation) (Safety) Regulations 2005</a>. This
includes motorboats, powerboats, fast powerboats (those than can travel at a
speed of 17 knots) and personal watercraft, commonly referred to as jet skis.
</p>

<p>Under the 2005 Regulations, every motorboat and powerboat (other than
personal watercraft) must have a lifejacket or personal flotation device for
every person on board, regardless of the size of the pleasure craft. Anyone
using a personal watercraft or jet ski must wear a lifejacket or personal
flotation device at all times. Anyone being towed behind a motorboat or
powerboat must also wear a lifejacket or personal flotation device at all
times. </p>

<p>Certain age restrictions apply to the use of lifejackets or personal
flotation device on mechanically propelled pleasure craft. All persons under 16
years of age must wear a lifejacket at all times on all pleasure craft. </p>

<p>Certain age restrictions on the use of mechanically propelled pleasure craft
also apply. Under the Regulations, it is illegal for anyone under the age of 16
to operate or control a fast powerboat or a jet ski. For persons under 12, it
is illegal to operate or control any mechanically propelled pleasure craft with
an engine more powerful than 3.7 kilowatts. </p>

<p>The consumption of alcohol or drugs on board is also restricted by the
regulations. Persons operating all pleasure craft must not consume alcohol or
drugs and any person on board any mechanically propelled pleasure craft may
only consume alcohol or drugs in a manner that does not affect safety or cause
a disturbance to the person in control of the craft.</p>

<p>If an offence is committed under these regulations, an on-the-spot fine of
€150 may be imposed or the offence may be prosecuted in the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a>. </p>

<h3>Water sports and recreational boating training </h3>

<p>The Irish Sailing Association (ISA) is the national governing body
representing sailing, windsurfing, power boating and personal watercraft in
Ireland. It advises on all aspects of boating safety and has a network of
teaching establishments that offer <a shape="rect" href="http://www.sailing.ie/Training.aspx">training for all leisure craft</a>
in Ireland. This training includes courses in how to operate dinghies,
keelboats, catamarans, powerboats, personal watercraft or jet skis and windsurf
boards. There are also courses offered in how to become a sea-based or
shore-based '<span>Yachtmaster</span>'. </p>

<h3>Radio installations</h3>
<ul><li><strong>Merchant ships:</strong> Under the Merchant Shipping (Radio)
    Rules 1992, every passenger ship or cargo ship of 300 Gross Tons or above
    is required to install a radio installation in compliance with the
    requirements of the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS).
  </li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Fishing vessels:</strong> Under the Merchant Shipping Fishing
    Vessel (Radio Installations) Regulations 1998, every registered fishing
    vessel must install a radio installation in compliance with the
    requirements of the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS).
  </li>
</ul><p>The radio installation must be capable of transmitting and receiving
different types of radiocommunications such as distress alerts and messages,
urgency and safety messages, meteorological information and public
correspondence. In addition, the installation must be capable of transmitting
and receiving locating signals. </p>

<p>The Maritime Radio Affairs Unit (MRAU), which is a unit within the Marine
Survey Office of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is responsible
for the implementation of these Rules and Regulations and is responsible for
surveying and inspecting radio installations and the issuing of Safety Radio
Certificates. </p>

<p>The MRAU may also survey or inspect Foreign Registered vessels and in such
cases, carries out these tasks in accordance with the standards of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.imo.org/About/Conventions/ListOfConventions/Pages/International-Convention-for-the-Safety-of-Life-at-Sea-(SOLAS),-1974.aspx">Safety
of Life at Sea Convention (SOLAS)</a> of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.imo.org/">International Maritime Organization (IMO)</a>. Where
a vessel is found to be contravention of any of the above Rules, Regulations
and standards and the deficiency is deemed by a Radio Surveyor to have a
potentially major impact on the safety of the vessel at sea, the Surveyor has
the power to detain the vessel until such time as the deficiency is remedied.
</p>

<h3>Radio licences</h3>

<p>The licensing of maritime radio systems is regulated by the Wireless
Telegraphy Act, 1926. Every ship that has a radio system installed must also
carry a Ship Radio Licence.</p>

<p>While owners of recreational craft, e.g., yachts, sail cruisers, motor
cruisers, etc., are not required to install a radio system, nevertheless if
they opt to install a radio system on a voluntary basis, they must also carry a
Ship Radio Licence on board. </p>

<p>Ship Radio Licences are issued by the MRAU. An applicant for a licence is
required to submit the technical details of the radio equipment installed on
the vessel. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dttas.ie/maritime/english/maritime-radio-affairs-unit-mrau-0">Download
an application form for a ships radio licence here</a>. </p>

<p>Every vessel that is equipped with radio equipment must also carry at least
one qualified marine radio operator. The qualification(s) of the operator(s)
depends on a number of factors, including the level of radio equipment
installed and the trading area of the vessel. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dttas.ie/sites/default/files/corporate/SRC%20Course%20Providers%2028%2002%2014.pdf">Details
of Ships Radio Licence Training Course Providers (pdf)</a> are available from
the Maritime Safety Directorate in the Department of Transport, Tourism and
Sport.</p>

<h3>Inland waterways</h3>

<p>Waterways Ireland is the agency responsible for the maintenance and
development of inland navigable waterways in Ireland, mainly for recreational
purposes. It is also responsible for the enforcement of the navigational rules
or bye-laws applying to the waterways under its remit. </p>

<p>While a licence is not required to operate a boat on these waterways, if you
own a boat, you may have to register it with Waterways Ireland or purchase a
permit. There is no charge for registration and if you buy the boat
second-hand, it may already be registered. The waterways for which registration
or permits are required are :</p>
<ul><li><strong>Shannon Navigation</strong> and <strong>Shannon-Erne
    Waterway:</strong> All boats with an engine more powerful than 11.2
    kilowatts must be registered and display their registration number. </li>

    7.5 kilowatts must be registered and display their registration number.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Barrow Navigation, Grand Canal and Royal Canal:</strong> All
    boats require a permit which must be displayed. There are 3 types of permit
    – a 12-month Combined Mooring &amp; Passage Permit, an additional
    12-month Extended Mooring Permit and a 1-month Visitor Permit.</li>
</ul><p>You can <a href="http://www.waterwaysireland.org/Pages/Commercial%20Activity/Boating-Permits.aspx">get
more information on registration and permits</a> on Waterways Ireland's

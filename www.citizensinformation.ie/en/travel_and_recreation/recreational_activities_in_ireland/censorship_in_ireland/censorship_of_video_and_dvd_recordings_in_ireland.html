<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>The Irish Film Classification Office (IFCO), formerly called the Irish Film
Censor's Office is responsible for examining all video/DVD recordings for sale
or distribution in Ireland. The primary legislation covering censorship of
video/DVD recordings is the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1989/en/act/pub/0022/index.html">Video
Recordings Act 1989</a>, as amended by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2006/2006/b20c06d.pdf">Civil
Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008 (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>A video or DVD can be:</p>
<ul><li>Classified as being suitable for a specific age group </li>
</ul><p><span>Or</span></p>
<ul><li>Classified as not suitable for viewing. </li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Each video/DVD is classified as being suitable for a specific age group
unless it is prohibited under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1989/en/act/pub/0022/sec0003.html#zza22y1989s3">Section
3 (1)</a> of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1989/en/act/pub/0022/index.html">Video
Recordings Act, 1989</a>. </p>

<p>A video/DVD can be prohibited if, in the opinion of IFCO the viewing of
it:</p>
<ul><li>Would be likely to cause people to commit crimes, </li>
  <li>Would be likely to stir up hatred against a group of people in the State
    or elsewhere or </li>
  <li>Would tend, because it is obscene or indecent, to deprave or corrupt,
  </li>
</ul><p><span>Or</span></p>
<ul><li>It depicts acts of gross violence or cruelty (including mutilation and
    torture) towards humans or animals. </li>
</ul><p>IFCO is not obliged to give a video/DVD the same classification as the <a shape="rect" href="censorship_of_films_in_ireland.html">feature film</a> and a
video and DVD may be classified differently from each other if they contain
different material. In general, Irish classifications are broadly similar to
those in existence in other countries. </p>

<h3>Video/DVD classifications currently in use</h3>

<p>The current classifications are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><span>G:</span> suitable for viewers generally, (including children of
    school going age). </li>
  <li><span>PG:</span> suitable for viewers generally, but parental guidance is
    recommended for children under 12 </li>
  <li><span>12:</span> suitable for people aged 12 or over. </li>
  <li><span>15:</span> suitable for people aged 15 or over. </li>
  <li><span>18:</span> suitable for persons age 18 or over </li>
</ul><h3>Offences and penalties under the Video Recordings Act</h3>

<p>There are a number of offences under the Video Recordings Act, including the
importation, possession or supply of prohibited or wrongly certified
videos/DVDs or supplying videos/DVDs without a licence. It is an offence to
supply a video/DVD to someone who is younger than the class the video/DVD is
certified as suitable for.</p>

<p>Members of the public may report violations (and suspected violations) of
the Act directly to the IFCO or to the Gardai who are authorised to seize
prohibited or wrongly classified videos/DVDs from suppliers. The penalties for
breaches of the Act include fines and, in certain cases, imprisonment. </p>

<h3>Making a complaint</h3>

<p>You can make a complaint about IFCO decisions on classification. If you are
not satisfied with IFCO’s decision on your complaint you can escalate your
complaint to the relevant Ombudsman. For complaints regarding children contact
the <a href="../../birth_family_relationships/children_s_rights_and_policy/the_ombudsman_for_children.html">Office
of the Ombudsman for Children</a>, for all other complaints contact the <a href="../../government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/office_of_the_ombudsman.html">Office
of the Ombudsman</a>.</p>

<h3>Appealing against a classification of a video/DVD</h3>

<p>The Classification of Films Appeal Board has 9 members who are appointed by
the Minister for Justice and Equality. An appeal against a decision of IFCO in
relation to the classification of a video/DVD to the Classification of Films
Appeal Board must be made within three months of the date of classification.
</p>

<h3>Records held by IFCO</h3>

<p>IFCO holds registers of certified and prohibited works and also registers of
licences of video/DVD retailers and wholesalers. These registers may be
examined at their office. At present, no fee is charged for this service. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<h3>Fees</h3>

<p>There is no fee for making a complaint to an Ombudsman.</p>

<p>IFCO, which is self-financing, charges fees to video/DVD distributors and
suppliers to offset the costs of licensing, certification, classification and
appeals. </p>

<p>The fee for an appeal to the Censorship of Films Appeals Board is €1,000.
The fee is refunded if the appeal is successful.</p>

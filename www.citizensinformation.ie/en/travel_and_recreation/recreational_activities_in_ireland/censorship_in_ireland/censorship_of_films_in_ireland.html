<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>The Irish Film Classification Office (IFCO), formerly called the Irish Film
Censor's Office is responsible for examining all films, <a shape="rect" href="censorship_of_video_and_dvd_recordings_in_ireland.html">videos and
DVDs</a> intended for public distribution in Ireland. In addition, IFCO is
responsible for certifying that they are fit to be viewed by members of the
public. IFCO may prohibit a film, video or DVD or, more usually, classify it
according to its suitability for different age groups. <br></p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Banning a film</h3>

<p>A film can be certified as unfit for viewing (in other words, banned)
because IFCO is of the opinion that the film is likly to cause harm to
children, or is indecent, obscene or blasphemous, or that viewing it might be
contrary to, or undermine public morality. IFCO may also rule that certain
parts of a film must be removed before it can be certified for viewing. The
Director of Film Classification must also view and approve the advertising
material connected to the film to ensure it is appropriate. A copy of the
Certificate must be shown for <span>at least 10 seconds</span> immediately
before the film is shown. </p>

<h3>Censorship and private film clubs</h3>

<p>Private film clubs (for example, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishfilm.ie/">Irish Film Institute</a>) are not obliged to
seek classification for films that are shown only to their club members. </p>

<h3>Film classifications currently in use</h3>

<p>Irish film classifications are broadly similar to those in use in other
countries. Film trailers are also classified and may only be shown with a film
of a similarly suitable classification. </p>

<p>An overview of the current system of film classification for Ireland is as
follows:</p>
<ul><li><span><a shape="rect" href="http://www.ifco.ie/website/ifco/ifcoweb.nsf/web/gguidelines?OpenDocument&amp;type=graphic">G
    (General)</a></span>: The film is suitable for everyone, including young
    children </li>
  <li><span><a shape="rect" href="http://www.ifco.ie/website/ifco/ifcoweb.nsf/web/pgguidelines?OpenDocument&amp;type=graphic">PG
    (Parental Guidance)</a></span>: While the film may be watched by
    unaccompanied children, parental guidance is recommended as to its
    suitability for children under 12 years of age. The film may contain adult
    themes or concepts that parents may wish to be aware of. If it has a
    romantic theme, it might have some sexual scenes or very brief nudity. It
    might also have some violence or mild bad language. </li>
  <li><span><a shape="rect" href="http://www.ifco.ie/website/ifco/ifcoweb.nsf/web/12pgguidelines?OpenDocument&amp;type=graphic">12A</a></span>:
    While the film is, in the opinion of IFCO, suitable only for people over 12
    years of age, a person under that age may be admitted to see this film if
    he or she is accompanied by a parent or guardian. </li>
  <li><span><a shape="rect" href="http://www.ifco.ie/website/ifco/ifcoweb.nsf/web/15pgguidelines?OpenDocument&amp;type=graphic">15A</a></span>:
    While the film is, in the opinion of IFCO, suitable only for people over 15
    years of age, a person under that age may be admitted to see this film if
    he or she is accompanied by a parent or guardian. </li>
  <li><span><a shape="rect" href="http://www.ifco.ie/website/ifco/ifcoweb.nsf/web/16guidelines?OpenDocument&amp;type=graphic">16</a></span>:
    Films classified in this category are considered to be suitable for persons
    of sixteen or over. Children under this age cannot be admitted to
    screenings. Violent content and depicition of violence may be stronger than
    in films designated 15A. </li>
  <li><span><a shape="rect" href="http://www.ifco.ie/website/ifco/ifcoweb.nsf/web/18guidelines?OpenDocument&amp;type=graphic">Over
    18</a></span>: Only people over the age of 18 may attend a screening of
    this film. There will be adult themes and there may be explicit scenes of
    sex or violence. There may also be bad language, including strong sexual
    swear words. </li>
</ul><h3>Making a complaint</h3>

<p>You can make a complaint about IFCO decisions on classification. If you are
not satisfied with IFCO’s decision on your complaint you can escalate your
complaint to the relevant Ombudsman. For complaints regarding children contact
the <a href="../../birth_family_relationships/children_s_rights_and_policy/the_ombudsman_for_children.html">Office
of the Ombudsman for Children</a>, for all other complaints contact the <a href="../../government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/office_of_the_ombudsman.html">Office
of the Ombudsman</a>.</p>

<h3>Censorship of Films Appeal Board</h3>

<p>The Classification of Films Appeal Board has 9 members who are appointed by
the Minister for Justice and Equality. The decision of the Appeal Board is
final, but the film may be re-submitted to IFCO after seven years. </p>

<h3>Offences and Penalties under the Censorship of Films Acts</h3>

<p>There are a number of offences under the Censorship of Films Acts, including
exhibiting a film without a certificate, failing to comply with the terms of a
restricted certificate and displaying publicity material that has not been
approved by IFCO. </p>

<p>It is also an offence in Ireland for a cinema to allow entry to a film by
someone below the classified age. (In other words, if someone under 18 is
allowed view a film for over 18's). If you see this happening, you should
report the offence to your local Gardai and they will initiate proceedings
under the Censorship of Films Acts.</p>

<p>The fines for breaches of the Acts are <span>under review</span> at present.
</p>

<h3>Records held by IFCO</h3>

<p>Various registers, not all of which are computerised, are held by IFCO. The
Register of Films gives basic information for each film and trailer examined,
including the certification. The Cuts Register records details of cuts made in
particular films and the Rejects Register gives details of prohibited films.
The Appeal Board Register records details of appeals and decisions made by the
Classification of Films Appeal Board. There is also an Accounts and Payments
Register. </p>

<p>The above information may be examined at IFCO's Office. At present, no fee
is charged for this service. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<h3>Fees</h3>

<p>There is no fee for making a complaint to an Ombudsman.</p>

<p>IFCO, (which is self-financing), charges fees to film distributors to offset
the costs of certification and classification. </p>

<p>A distributor is not charged a fee if the film, in the opinion of IFCO, is
an educational film. </p>

<p>The fee for receiving a copy of IFCO's decisions under Section 8(2) of the
Censorship of Films Act 1923 is €20. </p>

<p>The fee for appealing to the Classification of Films Appeals Board is
€1,000. The fee is refunded if the appeal is successful.</p>

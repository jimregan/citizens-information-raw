<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>While recreation and the environment in which young people participate in
recreation is changing, young people in Ireland are still involved in a wide
range of traditional recreational activities. These include sports, clubs,
music, dance and volunteering.</p>

<p>There is a strong focus on organised activities, particularly in the case of
younger teenagers. As they get older there is also a move towards more casual
activities that young people control themselves. These more casual activities
can include skateboarding, biking and using the internet, as well as just
‘hanging out’ with friends.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lc1607">National Recreational Policy</h2>

<p>In 2007 the Office of the Minister for Children published <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2Fyouthaffairs%2Fnatrecpol.htm">Teenspace
- the National Recreation Policy for Young People</a>. The overall objective of
the National Recreation Policy is to provide a framework for the promotion of
appropriate recreational opportunities for young people between the ages of 12
and 18. The policy aims to cover both organised activities as well as the more
casual activities that young people engage in during their free time.</p>

<h3>Youth cafés</h3>

<p>During the drafting of the policy, the need for casual recreational
opportunities in particular, such as drop-in centres and youth cafés, was
identified by young people. In 2010 the Department of Children and Youth
Affairs published <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/publications/Youth_Cafe_Best_Practice_Guide.pdf">Youth
cafés in Ireland - a best practice guide (pdf)</a> and <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/publications/Youth_Cafe_Toolkit.pdf">Youth
café toolkit - how to set up and run a youth café in Ireland (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Local Authority Play and Recreation Network</h3>

<p>In February 2012, the Department established the Local Authority Play and
Recreation Network (LAPRN) to introduce a more coordinated and interagency
approach to achieving the main goals of the play and recreation policies at
both national and local level. The network has developed and expanded a <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2FPlayandRec%2FPlayandRecPage.htm">National
Recreation Week</a> which takes place annually in local authority areas across
the country.</p>

<h3>Funding programmes</h3>

<p>The Department provides support to community and voluntary organisations
providing youth services, including recreational activities, through its <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2Fyouthaffairs%2Ffunding.htm&amp;mn=youb&amp;nID=5">grants
and funding programmes</a>.</p>

<h3>Youth arts</h3>

<p>In partnership with the Department and the Arts Council, the National Youth
Council of Ireland operates a <a href="http://www.youtharts.ie/">youth arts
programme</a> to promote and develop youth arts.</p>

<h3>Local Sports Partnerships</h3>

<p>Sport Ireland has developed a network of <a href="http://www.irishsportscouncil.ie/Participation/">Local Sports
Partnerships</a> to promote participation in sport.</p>

<h3>President's Award</h3>

<p>The President's Award is the National Challenge Award for young people
between the ages of 15 and 25 years. The purpose of the award is to reward

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>The Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA), which was established in May 1991, is
the country's leading national institution for the <a href="http://www.imma.ie/en/nav_9.htm">collection</a> and <a href="http://www.imma.ie/en/nav_8.htm">exhibition</a> of contemporary art. The
collection of artworks owned by or on long-term loan to the Museum consists of
works by Irish and non-Irish artists. The collection has been developed by
purchase, loans and donations, as well as by the commissioning of new works.</p>

<p>The Museum, which is housed in the <a href="http://www.imma.ie/en/subnav_92.htm">Royal Hospital in Kilmainham
(Dublin)</a>, presents retrospectives, solo exhibitions, group exhibitions and
projects. It also shows its collection in rotating temporary displays, as well
as exhibitions and projects organised by the Museum's Engagement and Learning
Department. </p>

<h3>Artists' Residency Programme</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.imma.ie/en/nav_11.htm">Artists' Residency
Programme</a> is the Museum's studio/residency programme, which provides
opportunities for artists to research and develop their artistic practice. This
programme is open to artists of all nationalities working in any medium -
artists either apply to the Museum or are invited to take part in the programme
by the Museum.</p>

<h3>Engagement and Learning Programme</h3>

<p>The Museum has developed a number of <a href="http://www.imma.ie/en/nav_10.htm">programmes and projects</a> intended to
address the needs of specific groups, such as schools and colleges. It provides
a range of options, including guided tours, workshops, talks, discussions and
studio visits, all of which can be tailored to meet the needs of a particular
group. </p>

<h3>National Programme</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.imma.ie/en/nav_12.htm">National Programme</a> is a
programme that distributes the assets, resources and skills of the museum to a
variety of situations and locations in Ireland, both north and south. Using the
museum's collection and exhibitions generated by the museum, the National
Programme facilitates the creation of exhibitions and other projects for
display in a range of locations around Ireland. The exhibitions are formed and
organised in partnership with local venues and groups. </p>

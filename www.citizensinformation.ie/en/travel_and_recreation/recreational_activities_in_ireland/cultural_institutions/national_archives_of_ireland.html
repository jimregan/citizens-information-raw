<p>The National Archives of Ireland is located in Bishop Street, Dublin 8.
These Archives contains many documents that are important and useful research
tools for researchers and citizens alike. The documents held in the Archives
help to provide an understanding of the social, economic and political history
of Ireland. The National Archives was formed in 1988, when the Public Record
Office (founded 1867, formerly at the Four Courts) and the State Paper Office
(founded 1702, formerly at Dublin Castle) were merged to create a single
institution. </p>

<p>The functions of the National Archives include the following: </p>
<ul><li>the preservation, restoration, arrangement and description of archives;
  </li>
  <li>the preparation of guides, lists, indexes and other finding aids to
    archives; </li>
  <li>making archives available for public inspection; </li>
  <li>making and providing copies of archives; </li>
  <li>the publication of archives, finding aids and other material relating to
    archives; </li>
  <li>the provision of educational services relating to archives. </li>
</ul><p>Many of the archives accessioned by the Public Record Office of Ireland
before 1922 were destroyed by fire and explosion at the beginning of the Irish
Civil War in June 1922. Consequently, the archives that are now held by the
National Archives date mainly from the 19th and 20th centuries, although some
date back as far as the 13th century. They can be summarised as follows: </p>
<ul><li>archives of Government Departments relating mainly to the period
    1922-1985; </li>
  <li>archives of the Chief Secretary's Office and its associated offices for
    the period 1790-1922; </li>
  <li>archives of other state agencies operating mainly in the 19th and 20th
    centuries, but including some archives from the 17th and 18th centuries;
  </li>
  <li>archives of the courts and probate registries dating mainly from the late
    19th and 20th centuries, but including a few items dating back to the 14th
    century; </li>
  <li>archives acquired from other sources, including Church of Ireland
    parishes, harbour boards, Health Service Executive (HSE) Areas (formerly
    known as '<span>health boards</span>'), hospitals, schools, charities,
    trade unions, business firms, solicitors' offices, estate offices and
    private individuals, relating especially to the 19th and 20th centuries,
    but including material from the 17th and 18th centuries; </li>
  <li>transcripts, calendars, abstracts and indexes of archives dating from the
    13th to the 19th century that were destroyed in 1922. </li>
</ul><p>You can find <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.ie/research/archives-held-in-the-national-archives/introduction/">more
information on the records held here</a>.</p>

<p>Documents cannot be removed from the National Archives building, but you can
inspect them in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nationalarchives.ie/services/service-for-our-visitors/the-reading-room/">Reading
Room</a>. The Reading Room is open to all members of the public holding a
current Reader's Ticket, which can be applied for on arrival at the National
Archives. </p>

<p>When a reader orders archives that are held in offsite storage, the archives
are normally produced in the Niall McCarthy Reading Room at Bishop Street at
10.00 am on the following day. </p>

<p>The archives of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are not
housed at the National Archives in Bishop Street but at the <a href="http://www.military.ie/info-centre/military-archives">Military Archives
in Cathal Brugha Barracks, Rathmines, Dublin 6</a>. Likewise, the <a href="http://www.gsi.ie/Services/Archives/">archives of the Geological Survey
of Ireland</a> are housed at the Geological Survey Building, Beggars Bush,
Dublin 4. To view these archives, you are advised to write or phone in advance.
</p>

<h3>Research Guides</h3>

<p>These research guides contain detailed information on specific research
topics and collections and are intended both for prospective researchers and
general readers. They may provide contextual information to record series
created by specific Government agencies, in addition to administrative
histories of those same bodies. <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.ie/research/research-guides-and-articles/introduction-2/">Further
information on research guides is available here</a>.</p>

<h3>Genealogy</h3>

<p>Many records relevant to Irish family history can be found within the
National Archives. These include census returns, wills and other testamentary
records, the Tithe Applotment Books and the Primary Valuation (also known as
Griffith's Valuation). Although the staff of the National Archives will assist
you in finding any relevant records in their custody, they cannot undertake
research on your behalf. They do, however, hold a list of <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nationalarchives.ie/genealogy1/genealogy-researchers-nationwide/">genealogy
researchers</a>. </p>

<p>Records relating to births, marriages and deaths are not held in the
National Archives. For these, you must contact the General Register Office â€“
see 'Where to apply' below. </p>

<h3>Reprographic Service</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.nationalarchives.ie/services/service-for-our-visitors/obtain-copies-of-archives/">Copies
of the archives</a> are available at the National Archives. These will
generally be in the form of photocopies, copies from microforms or copies from
digital images, depending on whether the document is suitable for photocopying
or whether a microform or digital image already exists. Bound volumes, maps or
fragile documents cannot be photocopied and alternative methods of copying
should be discussed with National Archives staff. </p>

<p>You will not be able to copy the archives yourself. You may order copies in
the Reading Room by e-mail or through the post. You may collect them or have
them posted to your address, depending on your requirements. </p>

re-emergence in the 17th century through to the work of Jack B. Yeats,
Ireland's most important 20th century artist. </p>

chiefly from the 17th to the 20th centuries. Irish portrait busts make up the
largest number of sculptures. </p>

<h3>Prints, drawings and watercolours</h3>

the 17th to the 20th centuries. The drawings and watercolours collection
includes most movements in European art from the 16th century to modern times.

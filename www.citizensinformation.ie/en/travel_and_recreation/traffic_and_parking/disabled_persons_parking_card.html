<p>Disabled Person's Parking Permits or Cards (also known as European Parking
Cards or Disabled Parking Badge) are available to people living in Ireland with
certain disabilities and those who are registered blind, whether they are
drivers or passengers. The parking card can be used by a disabled person in any
vehicle in which he or she is travelling. This means that a disabled person who
is being driven at different times by different people can bring the parking
card with himself or herself and display it in the appropriate vehicle. The
parking card is valid for 2 years from date of issue. Generally, the card is
not issued to anyone under 5 years of age. </p>

<p>The parking card scheme for disabled drivers and passengers applies to
public car parking areas only. However, the scheme also enables private car
parks, supermarkets, etc., to more effectively monitor parking in areas that
they have designated for people with disabilities. If you have a parking card,
the disabled parking spaces provided by local authorities are free of charge
and no time limits will apply to your parking. Some private car parks may
charge for use of a disabled parking space, but this will vary depending on the
operator. You can read more about <a shape="rect" href="parking_facilities_for_people_with_disabilities.html">parking facilitites
for people with disabilities in Ireland</a> here. Provision for the disabled
parking card scheme is set down in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0007/sec0035.html#zza7y1994s35">Section
35 of the Road Traffic Act 1994</a> and <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/si/0182.html">SI 182/1997 Road
Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997</a>. </p>

<p>Disabled (also known as 'European') Parking Cards can be used by disabled
people within the 28 member states of the EU and are also recognised in the US
and Canada. This means that when you travel abroad, you can bring your European
Parking Card with you. However, it is important to remember that you must
observe the motoring laws and restrictions on parking in other countries. The
EU Commission has produced a publication, <a shape="rect" href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/discrimination/files/parking_card_leaflet_en.pdf">Parking
card for people with disabilities in the European Union (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>The parking card scheme is administered by the Disabled Drivers Association
of Ireland (DDAI) and the Irish Wheelchair Association (IWA). </p>

<p>In June 2011, following a review of the Disabled Parking Scheme, <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/si/0239.html">SI 239/2011 Road
Traffic (Traffic and Parking) (Amendment) Regulations 2011</a> introduced
changes to the Scheme which included:</p>
<ul><li>Changes to the medical eligibility criteria to focus more on the level of
    mobility impairment </li>
  <li>New measures to reduce the fraudulent use of permits</li>
  <li>An increase in the size of some types of parking bays</li>
  <li>The introduction of new types of disabled parking bays</li>
  <li>Giving powers to local authorities to introduce time restricted parking
    spaces</li>
  <li>New set-down and pick-up only disabled spaces </li>
</ul></div>
The Regulation also removed the exemption which applied to Parking Card holders
from the rule against parking again in the same public space within one
hour.<p></p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You will automatically qualify for a parking card if you hold a Primary
Medical Certificate (<a shape="rect" href="../transport_and_disability/tax_relief_for_disabled_drivers_and_disabled_passengers.html">exempting
you from payment of VAT, motor tax and Vehicle Registration Tax</a>), however,
you must still formally apply for the parking card. </p>

<p>Local Health Offices of the <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/how_health_is_organised/health_boards.html">Health Service
Executive (HSE)</a> process applications for a Primary Medical Certificate. If
the HSE refuses your application for a Primary Medical Certificate, you may
appeal the refusal to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, National
Rehabilitation Hospital, Rochestown Avenue, Dun Laoghaire, Co. Dublin. </p>

<h3>Parking offences and disabled spaces</h3>

<p>It is an offence to park a vehicle in a disabled parking space unless you
have a current, valid Disabled Parking Card. If you illegally park in a
disabled parking space, you will incur a fixed charge parking fine. <a shape="rect" href="parking_fines_and_vehicle_clamping.html">More information on
parking offences is available here</a>. </p>

<p>Both traffic wardens and members of An Garda Siochana have the power to
request and inspect a parking card to ensure it is not being misused.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>A parking card costs €35. </p>

<p>Illegally parking in a disabled parking space will result in an €80 fine,
rising to €120 if unpaid within 28 days.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>To obtain an application form for a parking card, you can <a href="http://www.ddai.ie/parking-permit-application-enquiry">request a form
online from the Disabled Drivers Association</a> or write to the Irish
Wheelchair Association, enclosing a stamped self-addressed
envelope. In your letter you should give details about your disability
and how it affects your mobility. You should mention your age and the type of
mobility aids that you use, if any. If you have a Primary Medical Certificate
or are registered blind you should also mention it. </p>

<p>The application form must be completed and certified by your doctor and must
be countersigned by a Garda. Decision makers within the issuing authorities
will determine if you are eligible based on the information provided.</p>

<h3>Primary Medical Certificate</h3>

<p>To obtain a Primary Medical Certificate obtain an application form from your
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">Local Health
Office</a>. You must complete the application form and return it to the Senior
Medical Officer of the Local Health Office. The Senior Medical Officer then
appoints a HSE doctor to visit your home and carry out an assessment of the
level of your disability. If you satisfy the requirements, you are then granted
a Primary Medical Certificate by the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p>

<h3>Replacing a lost parking card</h3>

<p>Applications to have lost/misplaced cards replaced should be made directly
to either the Disabled Drivers Association or the Irish Wheeelchair Association
(whichever organisation issued the card).</p>

<h3>Renewing a parking card</h3>

<p>The parking card must be renewed every 2 years. You will be sent a renewal
form several weeks before your parking card is due to expire. Therefore, if you
change address you should tell the organisation that issued the card. </p>

<p>If you have had any corrective surgery or treatment that may have altered
the level of your mobility, you should report it in the mobility section of the
renewal form.</p>

<h3>Further information</h3>

<p>Information on how to apply, replace or renew a parking card is available on
the websites of the <a href="http://www.ddai.ie/index.php/parking-permit">Disabled Drivers
Association</a> and the <a href="http://www.iwa.ie/services/motoring/disabled-parking-permit-scheme">Irish
Wheelchair Association</a>.</p>

<p>Information on using the parking card abroad is available in the <a href="http://www.disabledmotorists.eu/">FIA Guide for the disabled
traveller</a>. </p>

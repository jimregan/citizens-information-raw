<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>There are a range of parking facilities available to people with
disabilities in towns and cities throughout Ireland. Disabled parking bays are
slightly wider than an average parking space to allow for easy access. They are
always located in "prime" parking spots beside building entrances, in city/town
centres, etc. These parking bays are clearly marked for use by disabled people
by both signs and road markings. (Road markings normally consist of the
"accessibility" symbol). </p>

<p>Although local authorities have no legal obligation to provide parking bays
for people with disabilities, a certain number of spaces are available in all
local authority on-street parking, local authority car parks and public
building car parks. The location of these spaces will be laid down in local
authority bye-laws. Information about the location of disabled parking spaces
may be available online or you can contact your <a shape="rect" href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">local
authority</a>. </p>

<p>Commercial premises like supermarkets and shopping centres have no legal
obligation to provide disabled parking facilities for their customers. Building
regulations have specific requirements about the indoor facilities for people
with disabilities and the approach to a building (e.g., a ramp to allow
wheelchair access) but the external environment of a building (e.g., parking
facilities) is not covered by any legislation. Planning permission will not be
refused if disabled parking facilities are not included in a planning
application. However, local authority planners may recommend that parking
spaces for disabled people be made available and a condition can be attached to
the application requiring the builder and architect to include these
facilities.</p>

<h3>Penalties for misusing disabled parking spaces</h3>

<p>Local authorities around the country operate a strong policy of enforcement
regarding spaces reserved for people with disabilities. A fixed charge <a shape="rect" href="parking_fines_and_vehicle_clamping.html">parking fine</a> of
€80 will be issued to drivers without a valid <a shape="rect" href="disabled_persons_parking_card.html">European Parking Card</a> who park
their cars in disabled parking spaces. In areas where clamping is in operation
(Dublin, Cork and Galway), cars parked illegally in these spaces will be
clamped and the fee for release will be €80 or more. </p>

<p>Private car park operators are responsible for policing the use of
designated disabled parking bays in their own car parks and cars parked
illegally in these bays may be clamped. Fees for release will vary depending on
the operator. Gardai and traffic wardens will not issue tickets for cars
illegally parked in disabled parking spaces in a <span>private</span> car park.
</p>

<p>Each accessible parking space is designated as reserved by a vertically
mounted or suspended sign showing the symbol of accessibility. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2002/en/act/pub/0012/index.html">Road
Traffic Act 2002</a> introduced a fixed charge system for common parking
offences. The fixed charge system came into effect in April 2006. A
fixed-charge fine for misuing a disabled parking spaces is €80 with 28 days
to pay. If unpaid in that timeframe, the fine increases to €120 with a
further 28 days to pay. Both traffic wardens and the Gardai may issue these
parking fines. Drivers are also obliged to show evidence if requested of a
European Parking Card and a traffic warden or Garda may inspect the Card. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You must have a valid European Parking Card prominently displayed on your
windshield to use a disabled parking bay. The card will show the signature and
photograph of the holder and is available from the Irish Wheelchair Association
or the Disabled Drivers Association. </p>

<p>Disabled parking places can only be used if the card holder (the disabled
person) is driving or travelling in the car. Able-bodied relatives or friends
may not use this card for their own benefit. If you park in a local authority
disabled parking space, a traffic warden or Garda may ask to see your European
Parking Card. If you or your passengers cannot produce this card or if the card
is in someone else's name, a fixed charge parking fine of €80 may be imposed.
</p>

<p>European Parking Cards (also known as Disabled Parking Permits) can be used
by disabled people within the 28 member states of the EU. If you are visiting
Ireland or are from outside of the EU you should bring your Disabled Parking
Permit/European Parking Card with you. Your Disabled Parking Permit/European
Parking Card should be visibly displayed in your parked car. </p>

<p>Private car parks will generally have parking spaces available for people
with disabilities, as will car parks for shopping centres, supermarkets,
universities, hotels and hospitals. To use these spaces, you will need the
European Parking Card. If there are time limits imposed in these car parks,
they may not apply to people with disabilities. The conditions of parking
should be clearly stated on signs.</p>

<p>Having a valid European Parking Card does not guarantee you a parking space
if none is available. </p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>If you have a valid European Parking Card, the disabled parking spaces
provided by local authorities are free of charge and no time limits will apply
to your parking. Some private car parks may charge for use of a disabled
parking space, but this will vary depending on the operator. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>Some <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Links/LocalAuthorities/">local
authorities</a> have lists of disabled parking spaces available on their web
sites. If you are unsure of the parking facilities available to you, you should
telephone ahead to your destination. The local authority in the area you will
be travelling to, will be able to give you information on the type of disabled
parking facilities available in its area. </p>

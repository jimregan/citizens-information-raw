<p>Responsibility for enforcing the law relating to illegal parking and
stopping of motor vehicles rests with traffic wardens and <a href="../../justice/law_enforcement/garda_siochana_national_police_force.html">an
Garda Síochána</a>. Illegal parking and stopping of vehicles on public roads
are considered traffic offences. Together with an Garda Síochána, traffic
wardens are empowered to issue <a href="../motoring_1/driving_offences/driving_offences.html">fixed-charge
fines</a> for these offences. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/local_and_regional_government/local_authorities.html">Local
authorities</a> employ traffic wardens to monitor instances of these offences
in their areas. The principal legislation governing this area is the <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1975_0014.htm">Local
Authorities (Traffic Wardens) Act 1975</a> as amended. The offences for which
traffic wardens can issue fixed-charge fines are parking and motor tax disk
offences, and are set out in the Local Authorities (Traffic Wardens) Act 1975
(Fixed Charge Offences) Regulations 2006 (<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2006/si/136/made/en/print">SI
136/2006</a>). </p>

<h3>Duties of a traffic warden</h3>

<p>In situations where a traffic warden has reasonable grounds for believing
someone is committing or has committed an offence, they may deliver a
fixed-charge notice on a prescribed form. This form is commonly known as a
"parking ticket". This form will state that you have committed an offence and
will state the date, time and location of the offence and will detail your <a shape="rect" href="../vehicle_standards/vehicle_registration_numbers.html">vehicle
registration</a>. </p>

<p>Most traffic wardens use a hand-held computerised device to issue tickets
and the local authority keeps a record of all tickets issued in a main
database. Using this database, the local authority can find out how many
parking fines a particular individual has accumulated. </p>

<p>Parking is restricted in certain place. For example, in certain towns and
cities, the local authorities have the power to restrict parking at certain
times and in certain places. These parking restrictions are clearly indicated
through signs clearly displayed at the roadside. You can read more about <a shape="rect" href="parking_fines_and_vehicle_clamping.html">parking fines and
restrictions here</a>. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>A system of fixed-charge fines for illegal parking and non-payment of
parking fees is in place. Both traffic wardens and members of the Gardaí issue
fines. </p>

<p>The parking ticket will contain the following details: a reference number,
the location of the offence, the registration number of the car, the amount of
the fine and the date and time the ticket was issued. </p>

<p>If you have been given a parking ticket or notified by a traffic warden of
an offence, you have 28 days commencing on the beginning of the date of the
notice to pay the fine. If it is not paid within 28 days, the fine is increased
by 50% and if it is still unpaid after a further 28 days then court proceedings
are initiated. </p>

<p>It is an offence to remove or interfere with a parking ticket that has been
placed on the vehicle of another person. If you do so, you could be liable to a
fine. </p>

<p>Anyone obstructing a traffic warden acting in the course of their duty is
guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine. </p>

<p>Traffic wardens can request or demand your name and address. They are
obliged to carry identification with them and to identify themselves as traffic
wardens. Failure to give your name and address on demand is also an offence and
you may be liable on a summary conviction to a fine. </p>

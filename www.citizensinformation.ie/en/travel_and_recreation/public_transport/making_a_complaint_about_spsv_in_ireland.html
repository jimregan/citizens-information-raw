<p>The <a href="http://www.nationaltransport.ie/">National Transport
Authority</a> operates a national complaints and enforcement system for taxis,
hackneys and limousine operators. The purpose of this system is to create
national standardised rules about how complaints should be made and to commend
drivers for standards of excellence and professionalism in customer service.
The Authority also has a national consumer information telephone line,
providing information and advice to customers about how to make a complaint.

<h3>Which complaints can be made to the National Transport Authority?</h3>

<p>The law (<a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/act/pub/0037/sec0064.html#sec64">Section
64 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013</a>) sets out the type of complaints that
may be made. These complaints are complaints relating to:</p>
<ul><li>The condition, roadworthiness and cleanliness of the vehicle</li>
  <li>The conduct, behaviour and identification of a driver </li>
  <li>Overcharging or other matters relating to fares charged by a driver </li>
  <li>Matters relating to the hiring and booking of an SPSV</li>
  <li>The identification and the general appearance of the vehicle </li>
</ul><p>If you booked the service through a dispatch operator, you should first make
a complaint to the dispatch operator. If you are not satisfied with the
response you receive, you can then make your complaint to the National
Transport Authority.</p>

<p>There is no charge to make a complaint about a Small Public Service Vehicle
operator. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you wish to make a complaint in relation to a Small Public Service
Vehicle operator, you can <a href="http://transportforireland.ie/taxi/taxi-compliments-complaints/">make
your complaint online</a>. The National Transport Authority also provides an information line on 0761 06 4000.</p>

<p>Remember to provide all relevant details regarding the incident and also to
enclose a copy of any receipt obtained for the journey in question. The
National Transport Authority must have sufficient evidence to identify the
person or vehicle that is the subject of a complaint. </p>

<p>The complaint will be investigated by the National Transport Authority's
enforcement team. The National Transport Authority may invite all relevant
witnesses to provide a statement of the events. The investigation will assess
evidence provided by all parties in a disputed situation. Once this evidence
has been collected and evaluated, a decision will be made as to how to proceed
with the complaint. </p>

<h3>How are complaints concluded?</h3>

<p>Complaints may be concluded in one of 4 ways. These are: </p>
<ul><li>No further action is taken</li>
  <li>Advice is given to the operator </li>
  <li>A formal warning is issued</li>
  <li>The complaint proceeds to prosecution in court</li>
</ul><p>Action will only be taken against an individual where evidence is of a
sufficient standard. You should be aware that all complainants should be
prepared to attend court (if necessary) to give evidence regarding the
incident. Please note, complaints cannot be proceeded with
<strong>anonymously</strong>. </p>

<h3>What if the complaint is criminal in nature? <br></h3>

<p>Criminal offences in Ireland are a matter for An Garda Síochána. If you
wish to make a complaint about a taxi, hackney or limosuine driver concerning a
criminal offence you should contact your local Garda Station immediately and
fill in an incident report. In an emergency situation, you should telephone 112
to be put through to the Gardai.</p>

<h3>Who do I make a complaint to about smoking in a Small Public Service
Vehicle?</h3>

<p>It is illegal for a driver or passenger to smoke in a Small Public Service
Vehicle, as they are considered enclosed places of work. If you wish to make a
complaint where a driver or passenger is smoking, you should first ask the
person to stop. If you do not receive a satisfactory response, you should note
as much information about the circumstances as possible. For example, write
down the details of the journey including the location, date, time, type of
vehicle, vehicle registration details and driver's identification. </p>

<p>You can then contact the National Tobacco Control Office, HSE Lo-call
compliance line at 1890 333 100 to register the complaint. <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/environ/Contact.html">Environmental
Health Officers of the HSE</a> enforce most of the tobacco control legislation.
All complaints are prioritised by the enforcement agency and dealt with
accordingly. </p>

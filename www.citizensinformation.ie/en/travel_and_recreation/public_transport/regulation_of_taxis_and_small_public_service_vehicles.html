<p>A <span>Small Public Service Vehicle</span> (SPSV) is defined as a public
service vehicle with seating for up to eight people. Small Public Service
Vehicles include taxis, wheelchair accessible taxis, hackney cabs and
limousines. The purpose of this document is to explain how these public
transport vehicles are regulated and your rights. </p>

    a private hire small public service vehicle (SPSV) for which a hackney
    licence has been granted. Hackney cabs should be pre-booked on a private

  <li><a href="http://www.nationaltransport.ie/public-transport-services/taxi/limousines/">Limousine</a>:
    a private hire SPSV for which a limousine licence has been granted. A

</ul><h3>How are taxis and other SPSVs regulated?</h3>

all SPSVs. An Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles gives advice
to the Authority on issues regarding SPSVs and their drivers. This group
consisted of representatives from the taxi, hackney and limousine industry,
local authorities, An Garda Síochána, the tourist industry and disability
action groups.</p>

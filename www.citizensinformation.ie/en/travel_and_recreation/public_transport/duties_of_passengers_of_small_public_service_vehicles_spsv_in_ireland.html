<h3>What are my responsibilities as a small public service vehicle
passenger?</h3>

<p><strong><span>To co-operate with the driver’s
instructions</span>:</strong> If you are travelling in a small public service
vehicle (SPSV), you are required under Section 29 of the Taxi Regulation Act
2013 to co-operate with any reasonable request by the driver. This includes <a shape="rect" href="../roads_and_safety/seatbelts_when_motoring_in_ireland.html">wearing a
seatbelt</a>, locking the door, behaving in a civilised manner and not asking
the driver to take more passengers than they are legally allowed to take.</p>

<p>A driver can ask you <span>not</span> to enter the vehicle or to <span>leave
the vehicle</span> if they have reason for concern. An example of this would be
if the driver feels threatened by you or suspects you to be intoxicated. In
this case you must obey the driver’s instructions.</p>

<p><strong><span>Not to damage the vehicle</span>:</strong> As a passenger, you
must not cause damage to or soil the vehicle in any way. This includes not
eating, drinking or smoking while in the vehicle. A soiling charge is payable
by a passenger who soils or damages the vehicle to the extent that it has to be
taken out of service, or will have to be cleaned or repaired.</p>

<p><strong><span>Not to put the driver at risk</span>:</strong> You must not
leave any sharp objects in the vehicle that may put the driver in danger. These
include syringes or sharp objects. As a passenger of a SPSV you must not behave
in any way that may put the driver at risk or compromise their safety.</p>

<p><strong><span>To obey the rules regarding the carriage of
animals</span>:</strong> The driver of an SPSV is not required to carry an
animal unless you have a disability and require the use of a guide dog or other
assistance dog. If you do, the driver is obliged under Regulation 39 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2015/en/si/0033.html">Taxi Regulation
(Small Public Service Vehicle) Regulations 2015</a> to take the dog onboard
unless the driver is unable, for medical reasons, to carry a dog in their
vehicle. </p>

<p><strong><span>To pay the appropriate fare</span>:</strong> If you are
travelling in a taxi, you must pay the maximum fare as shown on the taximeter
at the end of the journey (if the journey is within the taximeter area). If you
are travelling outside the taximeter area in a taxi, or travelling in a hackney
or limousine, you must agree to pay the fare before the journey begins,
including any booking fee. You must also be able to prove to the driver that
you can afford to pay the fare or give a deposit before the journey begins.</p>

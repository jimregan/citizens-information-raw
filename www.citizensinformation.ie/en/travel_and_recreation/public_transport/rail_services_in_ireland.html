<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Iarnród Éireann (or Irish Rail), a subsidiary company of a State-owned
company, Coras Iompair Éireann (CIÉ), is responsible for operating rail
services. Iarnród Éireann falls under the remit of the Department of
Transport, Tourism and Sport. The company operates passenger rail services
nationwide and provides commuter rail services, including the DART service in
Dublin.</p>

<p>Many stations have <em>park and ride</em> facilities to encourage commuters
to leave their cars in <a href="http://www.irishrail.ie/travel-information/car-parking">station car
parks</a> and reduce the volume of traffic. </p>

<p>Free travel on State rail services is available to everyone permanently
living in Ireland that is aged 66 and over. Certain people under that age are
also entitled. Read <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/extra_social_welfare_benefits/free_travel.html">further
information about Free Travel</a> here. </p>

<p>Smoking is illegal on all public transport in Ireland. <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/health_and_safety/ban_on_smoking_in_the_workplace_in_ireland.html">Read

<h3>European Rail</h3>

<p>You can find information about tickets for <a href="http://www.irishrail.ie/fares-and-tickets/sailrail">UK rail services</a>
and for <a href="http://www.irishrail.ie/fares-and-tickets/interrail">European
rail services</a> on Iarnród Éireann's web site. Registered blind passengers
travelling by rail or sea to Europe are entitled to buy one full fare ticket
and receive another one free of charge. You must produce your Companion Free
Travel Pass when booking to avail of discount. Details are available directly

<h3>Services for passengers with disabilities</h3>

<p>Special arrangements can be made for passengers with disabilities but it is
recommended that you contact the relevant station or Iarnród Éireann's
Mobility Impaired Liaison Office at least 24 hours before your journey and give
them some details of your travel plans. These details should include:</p>
<ul><li>When your train is scheduled to depart from </li>
  <li>Where you are going and if you need to change trains on your journey </li>
  <li>The nature of your disability </li>
  <li>Whether you will be travelling alone or with a companion </li>
  <li>Whether you need help arriving or departing from the station. </li>
</ul><p>If there is a change or cancellation of your journey you should notify the
relevant Iarnród Éireann staff. </p>

<p>Some stations can arrange for a car-parking space for wheelchair users and
all stations have disabled access to at least one platform. Portable ramps are
available at most stations for wheelchair users travelling on intercity and
commuter trains to enable them to board from the platform to the carriage. If a
group of people using wheelchairs are travelling together, Iarnród Éireann
will need to be notified in advance so that the necessary accommodation can be
provided.</p>

<p>DART trains can be accessed directly from platforms and the trains have wide
doors and a large area to accommodate wheelchairs. </p>

<p>Most mainline and suburban and all DART stations have public address systems
giving details of trains and services for people with visually impairments.
Tactile tiles have been put in place in some stations to help people with
visually impairments and Braille-coded buttons and a talking lift mechanism are
features of newer station lifts. You can check the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishrail.ie/travel-information/disabled-access">facilities
for disabled passengers available at any station</a> in the Iarnród Éireann
network by checking its web site. You can also find a <a href="http://www.irishrail.ie/travel-information/disabled-access">guide for
rail passengers with disabilities</a> on its website.</p>

<h3>Animals</h3>

<p>Guide and assistance dogs are permitted to travel on all services without
restriction. <a href="http://www.irishrail.ie/travel-information/travelling-with-animals">Pets</a>
are allowed to travel on DART or commuter trains provided they are properly
restrained. Dogs can only travel on intercity trains in the guard's van
(non-passenger compartment). </p>

<h3>Luggage</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.irishrail.ie/travel-information/luggage">Luggage</a>
should be placed in the specially provided luggage racks, overhead racks or
<em>in-between seat</em> spaces. You must also make sure your luggage is not
causing inconvenience for other passengers. <a href="http://www.irishrail.ie/travel-information/bicycle-information">Information
on carrying bicycles on trains</a> is available on the Iarnród Éireann
website.</p>

<h3>Complaints</h3>

<p>If you have <a href="http://www.irishrail.ie/travel-information/irish-domestic-rail-travel#puttingthingsright">complaints
about Iarnród Éireann services</a>, you should bring them to the attention of
the relevant station manager. If you want to take your complaint further, you
can contact Customer Relations, Connolly Station, Dublin 1. It is recommended
that you write a letter of complaint, including as much detail as possible
(date and time of travel, where you were travelling from and to and a phone
number). You should also send your ticket, if you still have it. You may get an
immediate response to your complaint but if not, you will get an
acknowledgement within 3 days and you should have a full response within 15
days. You may also <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishrail.ie/contact-us">make complaints or raise customer
services issues online</a>. </p>

<h3>Compensation and refunds</h3>

<p>If your service is seriously delayed for any reason within the control of
Iarnród Éireann, you could be <a href="http://www.irishrail.ie/travel-information/irish-domestic-rail-travel#compensation">entitled
to a discount voucher</a>. The value of discount voucher is based on the length
of delay and the fare you have paid for your single journey (that is,
approximately half the value of a return fare). </p>

<p>Refunds in discount vouchers are also given if your seat reservation is not
honoured and no seat of the same standard is available to you.</p>

<p>If the train you planned to catch is delayed or cancelled and you decide not
to travel, you will be given a full cash refund if you return your unused
ticket immediately to the ticket office where you bought it. </p>

<p>If you decide for some other reason not to use a rail ticket you have
bought, you can <a href="http://www.irishrail.ie/travel-information/irish-domestic-rail-travel#refunds">apply
for a refund</a> at any main InterCity station, the Dart office in Pearse
Station or any Travel Centre. There may be an administration fee. If you did
not buy your ticket from Iarnród Éireann, you should return it to the place
where you bought it. The ticket issuer will arrange any refund due and may make
a reasonable administration charge. </p>

<h3>Lost property </h3>

will be handed in and kept for collection. For more details, you should <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishrail.ie/travel-information/find-a-station">contact the

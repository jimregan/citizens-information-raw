<p>Luas is a Light Rail Transit (LRT) system (a public transport tram system)
that operates in Dublin, Ireland. The name Luas (<span>pronounced
"Lou-As"</span>) is the Irish word for speed. This tram system connects
suburban parts of Dublin city with the city centre on two separate tramlines.
These tramlines are:</p>
<ul><li><span>The Green Line</span>: connecting Brides Glen to St Stephen's Green
    in the city centre. This journey takes, approximately 40 minutes. </li>
  <li><span>The Red Line</span>: connecting Tallaght to The Point in Dublin
    Docklands. This journey will take approximately 53 minutes. </li>
</ul><p>The Green Line opened in June 2004 and the Red Line opened in September
2004. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.luas.ie/interactive-map.html">View a map
showing routes along the Green and Red lines here</a>. </p>

<p>The Red and Green lines do not connect. There is a 15-minute walk between St
Stephen's Green on the Green Line and Abbey Street on the Red Line. </p>

<h3>Frequency of Luas trams</h3>

<p>Luas trams will run every 4-5 minutes at peak time and every 10-15 minutes
at off-peak times. </p>

<p>Operating times for Luas trams are: </p>
<ul><li>Monday to Friday from 5.30 to 00.30 </li>
  <li>Saturday from 6.30 to 0.30 </li>
  <li>Sunday from 7.00 to 23.30. </li>
</ul><p>There are electronic displays telling you the time of the next tram at every
Luas stop. In addition, there are electronic displays and announcements
informing passengers of the next stop on board every Luas tram. </p>

<p>Special services operate during the Christmas season, New Year and on other
occasions. <br></p>

<h3>Luas services for disabled passengers </h3>

<p>Each tram makes audio announcements and has electronic displays so you can
tell where you are on your journey.</p>

<p>You are allowed to bring your <a shape="rect" href="../transport_and_disability/mobility_training_for_people_with_a_visual_impairment.html">guide
dog</a> on board Luas trams. No other animals however are allowed on Luas
trams.</p>

<p>All Luas tram and tram stops are wheelchair-accessible and there are
designated parking spaces for people with disabilities. The stops that have
been built in a cutting or on an elevated track have lifts to make then as open
to wheelchair users as they are to pedestrians.</p>

<p>Each tram has a low floor and level threshold with a minimal gap between the
floor of the tram and the edge of the platform. This makes it easier for anyone
using a wheelchair to board the trams.</p>

<p>If you use a wheelchair, you must enter through the double doors in the
middle of the tram where information on where and how to position the
wheelchair is shown. Make sure that you are facing the rear of the tram while
travelling.</p>

<p>There are two designated spaces per tram, which can cater for up to four
wheelchair users, complete with comfortable arm rests, which will come with
adequate signage to let people know that they are there for wheelchair users if
necessary. There is also enough space in the entry and exit areas on the trams
for a number of additional wheelchair users.</p>

<h3>Free travel on Luas</h3>

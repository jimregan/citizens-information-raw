duties of drivers of taxis and other small public service vehicles. <a href="http://www.nationaltransport.ie/public-transport-services/taxi/">Small

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>What are the duties of small public service vehicle drivers? </h3>

<p><strong><span>Information display:</span></strong> Drivers must display
their SPSV driver licence number on their badge. The regulations require all
drivers to also have the following information on display: </p>
<ul><li>The Driver County Identification and the five digit National Licence
    Number on the front and back of the roof sign of a taxi. </li>
  <li>National Licence Number and expiry date, vehicle registration number and
    number of passengers the vehicle is licensed to carry (on a tamper proof
    disc on the front and rear windscreen). </li>
  <li>The Driver ID Card on the dashboard inside the vehicle.</li>
  <li>Details on the <a shape="rect" href="charges_for_taxi_hackney_and_limosuine_services.html">national taxi
    fare</a> and information on <a href="making_a_complaint_about_spsv_in_ireland.html">how to make a
    complaint</a> and report good service (This is displayed in the front
    passenger area, such as on the sun visor or dashboard). </li>
  <li>The appropriate <a href="http://transportforireland.ie/taxi/information-cards-in-irish-english/">Passenger
    Information Card</a>, which provides useful information for passengers and,
    in the case of taxis, fare information (This is displayed in the back of
    the vehicle).</li>
</ul><p>It is an offence for a driver not to have the required information on
display. If found guilty, the driver can be subject to a <a href="../../justice/criminal_law/criminal_trial/maximum_fines_on_summary_conviction.html">class
C fine</a>.</p>

<p>Since January 2013, all taxis are required to have branding fitted in order
to renew the vehicle licence. The semi-permanent branding is fitted to the
driver’s and the front passenger’s doors, and it includes the vehicle
licence number.</p>

<p><strong><span>Right to refuse a passenger</span>:</strong> Drivers have the
right to refuse to take a fare from you if you are unable to prove that you can
pay the fare. They cannot unreasonably refuse to take you up to a distance of
30 kilometres. They may, however, refuse to take you any further.</p>

<p><span><strong>Taking the shortest route:</strong></span> Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/act/pub/0037/sec0023.html#sec23">Section
23 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013</a>, drivers must take the shortest possible
route when taking you to your destination. </p>

<p><strong><span>Fares:</span></strong> <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/act/pub/0037/sec0023.html">Section
23 of the 2013 Act</a> also makes it an offence for an SPVC driver to charge
you more than the fare agreed at the start of the journey. If found guilty they
can be subject to a class C fine. </p>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/act/pub/0037/sec0024.html">Section
24 of the 2013 Act</a>, a taxi driver found guilty of charging more than the
maximum fare shown on the taximeter can be subject to a class B fine.</p>

<p><strong><span>Operation of equipment:</span></strong> Taxi drivers must use
a taximeter that has been tested and sealed by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nsai.ie/LegalMetrology.aspx">Legal Metrology Service (LMS)</a>
to calculate the fare if the journey is within their taximeter area. Drivers
must ensure that the meter is in good working order as set out in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0027/index.html">Metrology
Act 1996</a>. Since September 2006, taxi drivers have been required to have the
national fare structure programmed into their meters. It is an offence to
operate a taxi without the meter being set up to charge accordingly. </p>

<p><span><strong>Issuing of receipts:</strong></span> All taxis are required to
issue you with a printed receipt from the taximeter upon payment of the fare.
Hackneys and limousines must also issue you with a receipt (which may be
handwritten). </p>

<p><strong><span>Accessibility:</span></strong> SPSV drivers are obliged to
facilitate passengers who use wheelchairs if they have a wheelchair accessible
vehicle and licence. Wheelchair accessible vehicles have to meet the standards
set out in the Authority's publication <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nationaltransport.ie/downloads/taxi-reg/nat-vehicle-standards-reqments.pdf">National
Vehicle Standards (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p><span><strong>Lost Property:</strong></span> SPSV drivers are obliged to
hand in any lost property left in their vehicle to An Garda Síochána. </p>

<h3>Compliance with road traffic legislation </h3>

<p>Drivers of SPSVs in Ireland must comply with Road Traffic legislation as
laid out in the various Road Traffic Acts. This means that they are obliged to
obey the <a shape="rect" href="../roads_and_safety/road_traffic_speed_limits_in_ireland.html">national
road speed limits</a>, wear <a shape="rect" href="../roads_and_safety/seatbelts_when_motoring_in_ireland.html">seatbelts</a>
at all times when driving, carry their <a shape="rect" href="../motoring_1/driver_licensing/full_driving_licence.html">driving
licence</a> with them at all times and ensure that their have adequate and
current motor tax and motor insurance. </p>

<p>In common with all motorists, SPSV drivers may receive penalty points and
fines if found guilty of certain <a shape="rect" href="../motoring_1/driving_offences/driving_offences.html">driving
offences</a></p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Public bus services are <a href="https://www.nationaltransport.ie/bus-licensing/">regulated by the
National Transport Authority</a> under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0037/index.html">Public
Transport Regulation Act 2009</a>. There is a range of public bus transport
services (both private and State-owned) offering services on a number of
routes. Operators providing public bus passenger services are required to be <a href="https://www.nationaltransport.ie/bus-licensing/do-i-need-a-license/">licensed</a>
unless the service is subject to a <a href="http://www.nationaltransport.ie/public-transport-services/public-service-obligation-contracts/">Public
Services Obligation Contract</a>.</p>

<p>The National Transport Authority has developed the <a href="http://www.transportforireland.ie/">transportforireland.ie</a> website,
as well as <a href="http://www.transportforireland.ie/available-apps/">smartphone apps</a>,
to help you when using public transport services. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cie.ie/">Coras Iompair Éireann</a> (CIE) is a State
company that operates the largest volume of services nationally - the following
information about bus services relates mainly to State-owned services.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dublinbus.ie/">Dublin Bus</a> is a subsidiary of CIE and
provides <a href="http://www.dublinbus.ie/en/Your-Journey1/Timetables/">bus
services</a> within Dublin, as well as to and from the surrounding areas. These
services include city bus services, Airlink and Nitelink.</p>

<p><strong>Xpresso:</strong> <a href="http://www.dublinbus.ie/en/Your-Journey1/Timetables/Xpresso/">Xpresso
routes</a> have fewer stops and, therefore, offer passengers a quicker
service.</p>

service</a> connects Dublin Airport to a number of city centre locations as

<h3>Dublin Bus fares and tickets</h3>

<p>In general, the <a href="http://www.dublinbus.ie/en/Fares-and-Tickets/Adult/">fare you pay</a> is
based on the number of stages you travel. There is also a <a href="http://www.dublinbus.ie/en/Fares-and-Tickets/Fare-Information/">city

Dublin Bus and only coins (not notes) are accepted. No change is given. If you
overpay, the driver will issue a Refund Due receipt with the ticket which can
be redeemed at Dublin Bus Head Office, 59 Upper O’Connell Street, Dublin
1.</p>

<p><strong>Prepaid tickets:</strong> You can also pay your fare with a prepaid
ticket. Magnetic prepaid tickets must be inserted into the bus validator when
boarding. Prepaid smartcard tickets must be validated by holding the smartcard
on the reader target for at least a second or until a light appears.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nationaltransport.ie/public-transport-services/rural-transport-programme/">Rural
Transport Programme</a> provides services to people whose travel needs are not

provided by CIE companies or by private transport operators.</p>

Programme to provide services. The Programme is currently being restructured
and involves establishing 18 Transport Co-ordination Units in place of the 35

<p>There are certain rules in place regarding how fares for taxi, hackney and
limousine services are structured and set. The National Transport Authority has
overall responsibility for determining fares for these services. </p>

<p>This document examines the current rules concerning how maximum fares are
set out, explains how taxi fares are calculated and recorded and the duties of
passengers and drivers.</p>

<p>Ireland is treated as one taximeter area. The maximum taxi fares are
provided for by Regulation 52 and Schedule 10 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/si/0165.html">Small Public Service
Vehicle (Consolidation and Reform) Regulations 2014</a>. They set the maximum
fares for the national taximeter area. </p>

<p>Since 31 January 2015, the remainder of the 2014 Regulations have been
replaced by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2015/en/si/0033.html">Taxi Regulation
(Small Public Service Vehicle) Regulations 2015</a>. Under the Regulations all
taxi fares for all taxi journeys are calculated on the meter. Where a fare is
agreed in advance, you can only be charged whichever is the lower - the
pre-agreed fare or the meter fare.</p>

<p>As of 30 April 2015, the maximum fares are set by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2015/en/si/0127.html">Taxi Regulation Act
2013 (Maximum Fares) Order 2015</a>.</p>

<h3>What is the maximum taxi fare?</h3>

<p>There is a standard rate and a premium rate National Maximum Taxi Fare. The
standard rate applies from 8 am to 8 pm. The premium rate applies at night from
8 pm to 8 am and on Sundays and public holidays. There is also a special
premium rate which applies between 8 pm on Christmas Eve and 8 am on St.
Stephen's Day and between 8 pm on New Year's Eve and 8 am on New Year's Day.</p>

<p>The National Maximum Taxi Fare consists of 3 separate parts: </p>
<ul><li>
    <div>
    <strong>Initial charge:</strong> amount which appears on the meter at the
    beginning of the journey. As of 30 April 2015, the national initial charge
    is €3.60 standard rate and €4.00 premium rate and includes an initial
    distance of 500m, or a period of 85 seconds. </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <strong>Further travel:</strong> after the distance/time included in the
    initial charge has been exceeded, the fare for further travel is calculated
    at small portions of the journey. At low speeds, or when a taxi is
    stationary, the fare is calculated on the basis of time. Once the taxi
    exceeds a certain speed, the fare is then calculated according to the
    distance travelled using three graduated tariffs. </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <strong>Extra charge</strong>: there are strict rules about extra charges
    that can be levied. These include a booking fee, additional passenger
    charges and a soiling charge. </div>
  </li>
</ul><p>It's important to remember, customers have the right to request a discount
before engaging a taxi. Drivers have the right to charge the maximum amount
calculated on the meter, or a lesser sum at their discretion. Any discounts
given may be recorded in handwriting on the receipt. </p>

<p>In the absence of any arrangement on discounts agreed in advance, the
customer is liable to pay the amount calculated by the meter in full. </p>

<h3>Taxis</h3>

<p>Under current Regulations, the maximum taxi fare is the highest amount you
can be charged by a taxi driver. The National Transport Authority has the power
to set the maximum taxi fares. </p>

<p>Taxi fares are calculated by a piece of equipment called a taximeter,
displayed in the front of the vehicle. The meter calculates the fare by time
and distance. All taxi meters must be tested and sealed before being used in
taxis. This is done by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nsai.ie/LegalMetrology.aspx">Legal Metrology Service
(LMS)</a>. The Legal Metrology Service is part of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nsai.ie">National Standards Association of Ireland (NSAI)</a>
and is responsible for enforcing the law on how measuring instruments are used
in business. </p>

<h3>Hackneys</h3>

<p>Hackneys do not have taximeters (that is, equipment installed to record taxi
fares) installed and therefore <span>maximum charges do not apply</span>. All
fares must be agreed between the driver and passenger <span>before the journey
begins</span>. </p>

<h3>Limousines</h3>

<p>As with hackneys, limousines do not have taximeters installed so again,
maximum charges don’t apply. If you choose to hire the services of a
limousine, you must agree any fares with the driver before your journey begins.
</p>

<h3>Fare cards</h3>

<p>A fare card is a card that must be displayed in all taxis showing how the
fare area is calculated. The card includes details on distance, time and
extras. The fare card should be displayed clearly where it is easily visible by
the passenger. </p>

<p>All licensed taxis are obliged to display passenger information including
rights and responsibilities and fare information, which are supplied by the
National Transport Authority, in the front and back of the vehicle. </p>

<h3>Current Regulations</h3>

<p>Under Part 3 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/act/pub/0037/index.html">Taxi
Regulation Act 2013</a>, it is an offence for a taxi or hackney driver to
charge you more than the maximum fee shown on the meter or the fee agreed at
the start of the journey. If you feel you have been overcharged, you are
entitled to make a complaint about the taxi driver. </p>

<p>It is an offence for a passenger in a SPSV not to pay the agreed fare or
maximum fare shown on the taximeter. The driver is entitled to ask you to prove
that you can afford to pay the fare before the journey begins. If you cannot
prove this, they can refuse to take you on the journey. </p>

<p>Under the 2015 Regulations, you are entitled to receive a printed receipt at
the end of a taxi journey upon payment. The receipt should detail the date,
duration of the journey, distance, amount paid and vehicle licence number. </p>

<h3>Can I make a complaint about a taxi fare?</h3>

<p>Yes. If you have a dispute about a fare you should pay the fare displayed on
the meter including extras. You should make sure you get a printed receipt and
proceed to make a formal complaint to the National Transport Authority. See our
document on <a shape="rect" href="making_a_complaint_about_spsv_in_ireland.html">making a complaint about a
taxi, hackney or limousine driver</a>. </p>

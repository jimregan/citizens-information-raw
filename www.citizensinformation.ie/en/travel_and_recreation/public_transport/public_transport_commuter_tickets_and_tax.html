<p>The <span>TaxSaver</span> Commuter Ticket Scheme was established in Ireland
in 2000 as an incentive for workers in some parts of the country to use public
transport. You can avail of public transport commuter tickets if you are
travelling for work by public transport bus or rail. The scheme is not confined
to State-owned forms of public transport and can include private operators if
they are approved transport providers.</p>

<p>In June, 2004 the Scheme was extended to include LUAS services. Since
January 2004 the Scheme has also applied where a pass/ticket covers more than
one operator (for example, an integrated ticket covering LUAS and Dublin Bus
services). </p>

<p>This incentive is seen as a positive way to encourage more people to avail
of public transport in Ireland and to reduce traffic congestion. The employers
and employees participating in the scheme sign a contract with each other
agreeing to participate. The employer then applies, for example, to Iarnród
Éireann and/or Dublin Bus for commuter tickets for employees who have chosen
to take part. </p>

<p>The <span>TaxSaver </span>scheme is operated by Dublin Bus,Bus Éireann and
Irish Rail and approved transport providers in conjunction with the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie">Revenue Commissioners</a>. The scheme
involves employers providing employees (including company directors) with bus
and rail commuter tickets while saving on employer PRSI payments. Employees
participating in the scheme benefit from reduced income tax, PRSI and Universal
Social Charge (USC) payments. </p>

<p>Employees receive tickets either as part of their salary package (salary
sacrifice), in lieu of an annual cash bonus, or as a benefit-in-kind. Savings
arise because tickets are not subject to tax, PRSI or USC. Employees only have
to pay tax, PRSI and USC on the "money" portion of their salary. Employer PRSI
is also calculated on the "money" portion of the employee's salary. </p>

<p>According to Dublin Bus and Irish Rail, employers can achieve PRSI savings
of up to 10.75% and employees can save between 31% and 52% of travel costs as a
result of tax, PRSI and USC savings by participating in the
<span>TaxSaver</span> commuter scheme. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<p>All employees (including company directors) of companies that choose to
participate in the <span>TaxSaver</span> scheme are eligible to take part, as
long as the commuter tickets are applied for and provided by the employer. </p>

<h3>Contract between employer and employee</h3>

<p>Employees who wish to take part in the <span>TaxSaver</span> scheme first
select the ticket type best suited to their needs. </p>

<p>Employers and employees must then sign a contract setting out the terms
under which they will participate in the scheme. To ensure the company is not
acting without an employee's knowledge, the employee must agree to the terms of
the contract and sign it. </p>

<p>All contracts between the employer and employee must be secured
<span>before</span> the employer applies for <span>TaxSaver</span> tickets. It
is important that both parties are clear from the start as to the conditions of
the contract. For example, they need to clarify what should happen if an
employee leaves the company before the ticket expiry date is up, whether a
monthly or an annual ticket would be more suitable, etc. </p>

<p>A signed contract is binding for 12 months. If, for example, an employee
goes on holiday during that time, he or she cannot give back the ticket, get a
refund for the time spent away and reclaim the ticket upon returning. </p>

<p>If an employee returns a ticket to an employer before the 12 months is up,
he or she cannot rejoin the scheme until the 12-month period has expired.
However, the company can get a refund for the portion of the year not used by
the employee. </p>

<p>Tickets are strictly non-transferable and cannot be exchanged for cash
benefits. </p>

<p>Once a contract between employer and employee has been signed, the employer
applies the tax conditions set out below and makes a group application to the
transport provider on behalf of all employees contracted into the scheme.
Individual applications from employees are not permitted. </p>

<h3>Tax conditions</h3>

<p>There must be a bona fide and enforceable alteration to the terms and
conditions of employment (exercising a choice of benefit instead of salary).
The alteration must not be retrospective and must be evidenced in writing. </p>

<p>There must be no entitlement to exchange the benefit for cash. </p>

<p>The choice exercised (i.e., benefit instead of cash) cannot be made more
than once a year and then only with the consent of the employer.</p>

<h3>Options for participation in the scheme</h3>

<p>Employees may participate in the scheme in one of three ways. </p>

<h3>Salary sacrifice</h3>

<p>By participating in salary sacrifice, employees receive
<span>TaxSaver</span> commuter tickets as part of their basic salary package.
</p>

<p>To illustrate how this works, assume that the annual cost of a bus/rail
ticket is €1,040 and that an employee is earning €20,000 per annum. Instead
of the employee buying the ticket him or herself for €1,040, the employee
agrees with the employer a salary sacrifice of €20 per week for the cost of
the annual ticket. (This equates to €1,040 for the year in which the employer
pays for the ticket.) The employee will not be charged to tax/PRSI/USC on the
portion of salary sacrificed; therefore, tax, PRSI and USC are now calculated
on the employee's salary <span>minus</span> the salary sacrificed (€18,860).
</p>

<p>From the employer's point of view, an employer will, as a matter of course,
claim an expense for salary paid to employees. Continuing the above scenario,
without salary sacrifice, the employer will pay €20,000 in salary and claim
an expense of €20,000 salary plus the employer PRSI paid thereon. (If you
assume a 10.75% rate applies, then employer PRSI would be €2,150.)
<span>With</span> salary sacrifice, however, the employer will pay and claim
€18,960 euro salary plus employer PRSI paid thereon (which comes to
€2,030.20 - this is where the employer saves) plus a deduction of €1,040
(the cost of the ticket). The cost of the ticket is now regarded as an
allowable expense for the purposes of Section 118 (5A) of the Tax Consolidation
Act 1997 as amended by <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0005/sec0008.html#parti-chapii-sec8">Section
8 of the Finance Act 2005</a>. </p>

<h3>Cash Bonus</h3>

<p>As an alternative to salary sacrifice, an employer may offer employees
<span>TaxSaver</span> commuter tickets in lieu of an end-of-year cash bonus. As
cash bonuses are chargeable to tax and commuter tickets are not, tickets
provide better value to employees than a cash bonus. </p>

<h3>Benefits-in-kind</h3>

<p>A third way in which employers and employees can benefit from the scheme is
for employers to offer employees <span>TaxSaver</span> commuter tickets as a
benefit-in-kind (e.g., in lieu of a parking space at work, as an incentive for
an employee to remain with the company, etc.).</p>

<h3>Benefits of participation</h3>

<p>Employers can realise PRSI savings of up to 10.75% by providing staff with
<span>TaxSaver</span> commuter tickets. </p>

<p>Employees can save up to 52% of travel costs as a result of tax, PRSI agus
USC savings. </p>

<p>There is no longer any need to queue on a daily basis for bus or rail
tickets. </p>

<p>Prepaid tickets are cheaper than paying cash. As an example, the valuation
on annual bus and rail or bus and DART tickets runs out after eight months,
which effectively means that for the last four months, a ticket holder is
travelling free. On Rail Point-to-Point tickets, a ticket holder is effectively
travelling free for the last two months. </p>

<p>It costs employers and employees nothing to join the scheme itself. </p>

<h3>TaxSaver ticket types and prices</h3>

<p>Dublin Bus, Iarnród Éireann and Luas offer several different types of
monthly and annual tickets. Employees should familiarise themselves with all
the available options and select the type of ticket best suited to their
travelling habits (bearing in mind that the ticket can be used outside office
hours, for leisure purposes, etc). Although annual tickets are ultimately
better value, monthly tickets might be more practical for companies with a high
turnover of staff. Detailed information sheets on each type of ticket are also
available for distribution to employees. </p>

<p>Monthly tickets are valid for one calendar month and may be purchased up to
two weeks in advance of the first of the month. Annual tickets are valid for
one year from the first day of any month and can be purchased anytime. </p>

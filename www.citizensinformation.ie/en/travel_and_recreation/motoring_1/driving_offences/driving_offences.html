<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>Each year in Ireland, thousands of people are issued with licences to drive
motor vehicles. These vehicles include motorcycles, cars, vans, trucks,
agricultural machinery, etc. In order to ensure high standards of road safety,
it's important that everyone is aware of the laws in place regarding motoring
in Ireland and the penalties in place if you break the law. </p>

<p>The Road Traffic Acts set out the main provisions for motoring in Ireland.
This legislation deals with issues such as vehicle licensing, vehicle
standards, your obligations and responsibilities, etc. Motoring offences can
include drink driving, speeding, driving without evidence of insurance or motor
tax, driving without due care and attention and driving without a seatbelt. A
new offence of driving while holding a mobile telephone was introduced in
2006.</p>

<p>You can be disqualified from driving a vehicle if a judge convicts you of a
motoring offence or of driving a defective vehicle. Driving a defective vehicle
can include driving a vehicle that is not road-worthy. A system of <a shape="rect" href="../../traffic_and_parking/parking_fines_and_vehicle_clamping.html">parking
restrictions and fines</a> is also in place throughout Ireland. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/criminal_law/criminal_trial/summons.html">Summonses</a> issued
to citizens for motoring offences are heard in the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a> and the
presiding judge has the power to impose disqualifications for driving and
endorsements of driving licenses. Motoring offences that result in a charge of
dangerous driving causing death are heard in the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/circuit_court.html">Circuit Court </a>before a
judge and jury unless the defendant pleads guilty prior to the hearing. </p>

<p>The Gardaí have the power to arrest the driver of a vehicle for certain
motoring offences. These offences include drink driving an dangerous driving.

<h3>Penalties</h3>

<p>Penalties on conviction for motoring offences depend on the severity of the
offences and on whether or not they are repeated offences. Penalties can
include monetary fines, endorsement of driving license, disqualification from
driving for life, and in the most serious cases, imprisonment. In addition a <a shape="rect" href="penalty_points_for_driving_offences.html">penalty points
system</a> is in place for certain motoring offences. View a <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/Documents/Licensed%20Drivers/Penalty%20Points%20Offences%2017%20April%202016.pdf">list
of motoring offences that attract penalty points (pdf). </a></p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0023/index.html">Road
Traffic Act, 2006</a> increased the maximum monetary penalties (fines) which a
court can impose in relation to most common motoring offences. </p>

<p>Penalties on conviction for dangerous driving causing death are the same as
penalties for manslaughter and also carry a mandatory disqualification from
driving for a minimum of 4 years. Since October 2011 all convictions in the
District Court for <a shape="rect" href="drink_driving_offences_in_ireland.html">drink driving offences</a> carry
a mandatory disqualification for a minimum of 6 months. Gardaí also have the
power to impound vehicles which are not insured or in certain circumstances
vehicles which are not taxed or vehicles which do not have a certificate of
roadworthiness. </p>

<h3>Disqualification from driving</h3>

<p>Disqualification orders are usually made by a court preventing a person from
validly holding a drivers licence or from applying for one for a defined or
stated period of time. A disqualification can, however, also arise from the
penalty points system. </p>

<p>There are five different types of disqualifications from driving: </p>
<ul dir="ltr"><li><strong>Consequential Disqualification</strong>: Where a court is obliged
    to make an order disqualifying a person who is convicted of certain
    offences. The Road Traffic Act 2006 increased the minimum periods
    established for consequential disqualification orders. Consequential
    disqualifications are the most common type of disqualification handed down
    by the courts.</li>
  <li><strong>Ancillary Disqualification</strong>: These disqualification
    orders are an optional addition to any other legal penalty imposed by a
    court. So, a judge may impose an ancillary disqualification depending on
    the circumstances of the case. Examples of this would be where a vehicle
    was used in a bank raid and the judge imposed an ancillary disqualification
    on all the occupants of the car and not just the driver. </li>
  <li><strong>Special Disqualification</strong>: Unlike the first two types of
    disqualification orders (which require someone to have been convicted of an
    offence before they can be imposed), special disqualification orders do not
    require someone to be convicted in order to impose the disqualification. If
    the Gardaí or the <a href="http://www.ndls.ie/">National Driver Licence
    Service (NDLS)</a> have reasonable grounds for believing that a licence
    holder is either: 
    <p>- unfit to drive by reason of a physical disease or</p>
    <p>- unfit to drive because of a physical or mental disability or</p>
    <p>- incompetent to drive any vehicle or any class of vehicle</p>
    <p>they can apply to the District Court for a special disqualification
    order.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>EU Disqualification</strong>: Transfers an order made in one EU
    state to another where the disqualified person resides. Although the <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:1998:216:0001:0001:EN:PDF">1998
    EU Convention on Driving Disqualifications (98/C 216/01)</a> which allows
    for such transfer of disqualification orders is not yet in force, it is
    hoped that this will become law. <a shape="rect" href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_criminal_matters/l33065_en.htm">The
    Convention</a> relates to disqualification for offences that involve:<br>
    - reckless or dangerous driving of a motor vehicle <br>
    - hit-and-run driving <br>
    - driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other
    substances affecting or diminishing the driver's mental and physical
    abilities<br>
    - driving a vehicle faster than the permitted speed <br>
    In advance of the Convention coming into force, the mutual recognition of
    driving disqualifications between Ireland and the UK (including Norther
    Ireland) came into operation from 28 January 2010. (Does not include
    disqualifications resulting from the accumulation of penalty points.) </li>
  <li><strong>Penalty Points Disqualification</strong>: This disqualification
    order is not issued by the courts but by the Department of Transport,
    Tourism and Sport. When a person accumulates a total of 12 points or more
    on their licence, then the Department will notify them that from a certain
    date they will be disqualified from driving for a period of six months. The
    person will then be required to send their driving licence to the NDLS.
    (The disqualification threshold is reduced to 7 penalty points for those
    who obtain their first learner permit on or after 1 August 2014 and
    subsequently during the first 2 years while they drive under their first
    driving licence.) </li>
</ul><p>Any disqualification order issued by the courts can be appealed within 14
days from the date of conviction. If the judge orders you to be disqualified
from driving and you do not appeal the conviction, you will receive a Notice
from the Fines Office of the District Court where you appeared, stating that
you must hand in your driving licence immediately. </p>

<p>The Fines Office of the District Court will require you to submit any
driving licence/learner permit you hold to the NDLS, together with the details
of the Court Order. The NDLS will hold your driving licence/learner permit
until the period of disqualification is over. </p>

<h3>Penalty points endorsement</h3>

<p>The penalty points system of endorsement is by entry in the licence record.
The record is endorsed on the National Vehicle and Driver File operated by the
Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on notification from the Courts or
An Garda Síochána as appropriate.</p>

<p>Penalty point endorsements remain on your licence record for 3 years and
must be notified to your insurance company when applying for motor insurance,
providing you hold a current driving licence. Endorsements on your licence
record will often lead to an increase in your motor insurance premium. </p>

<h3>Fixed charge offences</h3>

<p>A system of fixed charge driving offences operates in Ireland which allows
the driver of a vehicle who has been detected of committing certain offences
under the Road Traffic Acts to pay a fixed charge or fine as an alternative to
going to court to answer the driving offence. View a <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/Documents/Licensed%20Drivers/Fixed%20Charge%20Offences%20Only%20as%20at%20November%202012.pdf">list
of fixed charge only offences (pdf)</a>. </p>

<p>The Minister has the power to declare any summary (or minor) offence under
the Road Traffic Acts 1961-2011 to be fixed charge offences. A person has 28
days from the date of the issue of the fixed charge notice to pay the fine. If
it is not paid within 28 days, the charge is increased by 50% and if it is
still unpaid after a further 28 days then court proceedings are initiated. </p>

<p>If you receive a fixed charge notice for a driving offence and you were not
the driver of the vehicle you must return the notice to the Garda Fixed Charge
Processing Office (see 'Where to apply' below) and include the details of the
person who was driving (including his/her driving licence number) in the form
attached to the fixed charge notice for that purpose. The Gardaí will then
issue a fixed charge notice to the driver of the vehicle. The registered owner
of the vehicle is the person to whom the fixed charge notice will be sent if
the driver of the vehicle was not identified at the time the offence was
detected, (e.g. detected by a speed camera or if a car was parked illegally).
If the registered owner was not the driver he/she is still obliged by law to
notify the Gardaí of who the driver of the vehicle was at the time of the
offence.</p>

<p>If you misplace, lose or damage your fixed charge notice, you should contact
the Garda Fixed Charge Processing Office at:</p>
<ul><li>Locall 1890 30 40 60 </li>
  <li>Email <a shape="rect" href="mailto:npo@garda.ie">npo@garda.ie</a> </li>
</ul><p>A re-print of the notice will be sent to you by post. However, the time
period allowed for payment is <em>not</em> extended by your request for a
re-print.</p>

<p>If the fixed charge notice is paid within the legal time limits and court
proceedings are not commenced you will not have a criminal record in respect of
the offence. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=348&amp;Lang=1">Further
information on fixed charge notices</a> is available on the Garda website. It
also has a <a href="http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=13233">guide to
cancellations of fixed charge notices</a>. </p>

<h3>Motor tax and insurance <br></h3>

<p>Motorists in Ireland are obliged to display evidence that they have paid
their motor tax and have current motor insurance on the windscreen of their
vehicles. If a vehicle is found by the Gardaí not to have a current motor
insurance policy they have the power to impound the vehicle until such time as
an insurance certificate is produced by the owner which insures the use of the
vehicle. The owner of the vehicle will be liable to all charges or costs
incurred by the Gardaí in the removal and storage of the vehicle. The Road
Traffic Act 2006 extended this power to include the power to impound vehicles
registered outside of Ireland. </p>

<p>Similarly, the Gardaí are empowered to impound any vehicle which has not
been taxed for a period of two months or more. In reality this means that if
you are stopped by the Gardaí while driving a vehicle and the road tax for
that vehicle is out of date by two months or more, the Gardaí can seize that
vehicle and impound it until such time as the owner can show proof that the
motor tax has been paid for that vehicle to include the date on which it was
impounded (i.e. paying the arrears due on the vehicle). Again, the owner of the
vehicle will be liable for all charges and costs incurred by the Gardaí in the
removal and storage of the vehicle. </p>

<h3>Driving offences committed in other jurisdictions </h3>

<p>Penalty points and endorsements on driving licences acquired in other
countries (including EU/EEA member states) are not recognised between states.
Although a European Convention on driving disqualifications was signed by the
member states in June of 1998 which allowed making certain disqualification
effective throughout the EU, the Convention has not yet come into force. </p>

<p>In practice therefore, this means if you acquired penalty points or have
endorsements on your driving licence before coming to Ireland, these penalty
points or endorsements will not transfer over to an Irish driving licence. If,
however, you have been disqualified from driving in another country and this
was in addition to a prison sentence for driving offences it may not be
possible for you to exchange your full foreign driving licence for a full
driving licence here in Ireland. </p>

<p>Mutual recognition of driving disqualifications between Ireland and the UK
(including Norther Ireland) came into operation from 28 January 2010. It does
not include disqualifications resulting from the accumulation of penalty
points.</p>

<h3>Driving on a foreign licence in Ireland</h3>

<p>If you are driving on a foreign driving licence in Ireland and acquire
penalty points here, a record will be created and the points added to the
record. If you accumulate 12 penalty points on the record in a 3-year period
you will be disqualified from driving in Ireland. </p>

<h3>Appealing a disqualification</h3>

<p>If you have been convicted of motoring offences and disqualified from
driving in a District Court, you can appeal the disqualification to the Circuit
Court. You must lodge an appeal within 14 days of your conviction. If you wish
to represent yourself, the court clerk in your local District Court will help
you complete the necessary forms. Alternatively, your solicitor can assist
you.</p>

<h3>Removal of a disqualification</h3>

<p>If you have been disqualified from driving and wish to apply to the courts
for an early restoration of your licence, you may do so in person or through a
solicitor following payment of the appropriate fee.You may apply for the early
restoration when half your disqualification period is over. However, you cannot
apply for an early restoration:</p>
<ul><li>If the disqualification is for 2 years or less </li>
  <li>If the disqualification is not your first disqualification order within
    the previous 10 years</li>
</ul><p>The court can reduce the period of disqualification to two-thirds of the
original period of disqualification or to 2 years, whichever is the greater.</p>

<p>The court clerk of your District and Circuit Court will tell you about the
court venues and dates.</p>

<p>The National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) holds your driving licence while
you are disqualified. To get your driving licence back when your period of
disqualification expires contact customer service in the NDLS (see below). You
will need your <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">PPS
number</a> or your driver number.</p>

<h3>Driving licence record</h3>

<p>You can apply to the NDLS for a copy of your driving licence record. <br></p>

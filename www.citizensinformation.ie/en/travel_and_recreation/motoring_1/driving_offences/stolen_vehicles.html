<p>Every day many vehicles are stolen from their owners. Sometimes a vehicle
may be stolen as a result of carelessness on the part of the owner. For
example, by leaving your vehicle unlocked or unattended in public places,
etc.</p>

<p>It's very important to be aware of the potential risks when you leave your
vehicle unattended (for even a few moments) in a public place. It's also
important to be aware about parking, particularly when you park in daylight but
return much later in darkness. If your vehicle has an alarm, you should ensure
that it is functioning properly and switched on when you leave your vehicle.
You might also consider using a safety chain or other visible deterrant around
the steering wheel to put off potential thieves. </p>

<p>If you find your vehicle has been stolen, you should report this to the
Gardai immediately. Vehicles that are reported as stolen to members of the
Gardai are entered on a central database to which all Garda stations in Ireland
have access. Stolen vehicles and reported stolen vehicles can be monitored and
tracked through any part of the country by the Gardai in this way. </p>

<p>As a usual rule, insurance companies allow a period of approximately 3
months before claims in respect of stolen vehicles are processed. Insurance
companies have their own methods of verifying stolen vehicles but will often
contact the Gardai to confirm that the vehicle has been reported as stolen and
to verify that the vehicle has not been located or returned to the registered
owner. The insurance company and Gardai remain in close contact and the
insurance company is notified by the Gardai if the stolen vehicle is located at
a future date. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are cycling it is important that you are aware of the laws in place
regarding cycling and the penalties in place if you break the law. The <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/revised-acts/alphabetical-list-of-html-and-pdf-post-2006-revised-acts.557.html#R">Road
Traffic Acts 1961-2014</a> set out the main provisions for motoring and
legislate for bicycles as well as mechanically propelled vehicles and trailers.
There is also secondary legislation which regulates the behaviour of motorists
and cyclists.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="leda94">Bicycles</h2>

<p>As well as those regulating cyclist behaviour, there are regulations setting
out the equipment a bicycle must have.</p>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1963/en/si/0189.html">Road
Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations 1963</a> a bicycle ridden in a
public place during lighting-up hours must be equipped with a rear red
reflector, and with front and rear lights that can be seen from a reasonable
distance. The front light must be white or yellow, while the rear light must be
red. It is legal to use flashing lights. You can find more information in our
document on <a href="../../vehicle_standards/lighting_of_bicycles_in_ireland.html">lighting
of bicycles</a>.</p>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1963/en/si/0190.html">Road
Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963</a> a
bicycle used in a public place must be fitted with a bell capable of being
heard at a reasonable distance. It must also be equipped with brakes, one for
the front wheel and another for the rear wheel.</p>

<p>Your bicycle and its equipment must be in good working order. Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1961/en/act/pub/0024/sec0020.html#sec20">Section
20 of the Road Traffic Act 1961</a>, if a Garda, having tested your bicycle,
has reasonable grounds for believing that your bicycle has a dangerous defect,
the Garda may instruct you not to ride the bicycle in a public place until the
defect is remedied. If you fail to do as requested, you are committing an
offence.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l14943">Cycling</h2>

<p>When cycling you must obey the rules set out in the Road Traffic Acts and
Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997-2014.</p>

<p>For example, Article 11 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/si/0332.html">Road Traffic
(Traffic and Parking) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2012</a> prohibits you
from cycling beyond a traffic sign that prohibits bicycles. Article 14 of the
<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/si/0182.html">Road Traffic
(Traffic &amp; Parking) Regulations 1997</a> (as substituted by the 2012
Regulations) provides that where a cycle lane is provided, you must use it. If
the cycle lane is a <em>contra-flow</em> cycle lane, you can only cycle in the
contra-flow direction on it. Article 13 of the 1997 Regulations makes it an
offence to cycle on a footpath unless you are entering or exiting a property.
Under Article 45 of the 1997 Regulations (as amended by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/si/0274.html">Road Traffic
(Traffic and Parking) (Amendment) Regulations 1998</a>), you must not cycle in
a pedestrianised street or area during the period indicated on the information
plate accompanying the pedestrianised street or area traffic sign, unless you
are cycling on a cycle lane.</p>

<p>Like other road users, cyclists must obey the rules applying to traffic
lights, pedestrian crossings, zebra crossings and cycle traffic lights. You
must stop at stop signs and yield right of way at yield signs.</p>

<p>Under Article 47 of the 1997 Regulations (as substituted by the 2012
Regulations), you must not cycle more than 2 abreast, except when overtaking
and it does not endanger or obstruct other traffic. You can overtake a vehicle
on the left where the vehicles to your right are stationary or are moving
slower than you, except when the vehicle to be overtaken:</p>
<ul><li>Has signalled an intention to turn to the left and will execute the
    movement to the left before you overtake it</li>
  <li>Is stationary for the purpose of allowing a passenger to alight or board
    the vehicle</li>
  <li>Is stationary for the purposes of loading or unloading</li>
</ul><p><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1961/en/act/pub/0024/sec0100.html#sec100">Section
100 of the Road Traffic Act 1961</a> makes it an offence to ride a bicycle
while holding on to another moving vehicle (other than another bicycle which no
one is riding).</p>

<h3>Garda powers</h3>

<p>A Garda can ask for your name, address and date of birth if you are
suspected of:</p>
<ul><li>Having committed an offence</li>
  <li>Having been involved in a collision or other event in a public place
    causing injury or damage</li>
</ul><p>If you refuse to give your details or give details which the Garda believes
to be false or misleading, the Garda can take your bicycle and retain it until
such time as your identity is proven.</p>

<p>A Garda can arrest you without a warrant:</p>
<ul><li>If you are riding a bicycle while under the influence of alcohol and/or
    drugs so that you do not have proper control of the bicycle</li>
  <li>If the Garda has reasonable grounds for believing that you are riding a
    bicycle without the owner’s consent</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l6bf4b">Penalties</h2>

<p>If you are charged with a cycling offence, you will have to attend court. In
general, if you are guilty of a cycling offence, you are liable on summary
conviction:</p>
<ul><li>In the case of a first offence to a <a href="../../../justice/criminal_law/criminal_trial/maximum_fines_on_summary_conviction.html">class
    D fine</a></li>
  <li>In the case of a second or subsequent such offence to a class C fine</li>
</ul><p>In the case of 3 or more such offences in a 12-month period you are liable
to a class C fine or to imprisonment for up to 3 months, or to both a fine and
imprisonment.</p>

<p>If you are convicted of riding a bicycle while under the influence of
alcohol and/or drugs, you are liable on summary conviction to a class C
fine.</p>

<h3>Fixed charge offences</h3>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2015/en.si.2015.0331.pdf">Road Traffic
(Fixed Charges Offences – Cyclists) Regulations 2015 (pdf)</a> certain
cycling offences have been declared to be fixed charge offences. The fixed
charge system allows someone who has been detected committing a fixed charge
offence to pay a fixed charge or fine as an alternative to going to court to
answer the offence. The fixed charge for a cycling offence is set at €40.</p>

<p>Since 31 July 2015 the cycling offences to which a fixed charge applies
are:</p>
<ul><li>No front or rear light during lighting-up hours</li>
  <li>Riding a bicycle without reasonable consideration</li>
  <li>Failing to stop for a school warden sign</li>
  <li>Failing to stop at traffic lights when the red lamp is lit</li>
  <li>Failing to stop at cycle traffic lights when the red lamp is lit</li>
  <li>Failing to stop at a stop line, barrier or half barrier at a railway
    level crossing, swing bridge or lifting bridge, when the red lamps are
    flashing.</li>
  <li>Cycling in a pedestrianised street or area</li>
</ul><p>If you receive a fixed charge notice, you have 28 days from the date of the
issue of the fixed charge notice to pay the fine. If it is not paid within 28
days, the charge is increased by 50%. If it is still unpaid after a further 28
days then court proceedings are initiated.</p>

<p>If you misplace, lose or damage your fixed charge notice, you should contact
the Garda Fixed Charge Processing Office (see ‘Where to apply’ below). A
re-print of the notice will be sent to you by post. However, the time period
allowed for payment is not extended by your request for a re-print.</p>

<p>If the fixed charge notice is paid within the legal time limits and court
proceedings are not commenced, you will not have a criminal record in respect
of the offence.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=348&amp;Lang=1">Further
information on fixed charge notices</a> is available on the Garda website. It
also has a <a href="http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=13233">guide to
cancellations of fixed charge notices</a>.</p>

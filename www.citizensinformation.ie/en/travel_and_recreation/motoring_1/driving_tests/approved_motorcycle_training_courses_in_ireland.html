<p>Motorcycle, moped and scooter users can be vulnerable road users. These
vehicles are capable of travelling at high speeds and in varying weather
conditions. Motorcycling can be a safe means of transport but being aware of
the various dangers on the road, your own driving style and your obligations as
a road user will help to ensure that you travel safely. </p>

<p>Participation on a good-quality motorcycle training course contributes to
improved safety for both the rider and other road users. Any instructor
providing motorcycle training in Ireland must be <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Finding-an-instructor/">approved
by the Road Safety Authority</a>.</p>

<h3>Initial Basic Training</h3>

<p>Since 6 December 2010, when you obtain your first learner permit for a
particular category you must complete Initial Basic Training (IBT) before you
can ride your motorcycle on the road unsupervised by your IBT instructor. IBT
is a modular training programme, which has been developed by the Road Safety
Authority and is delivered by approved IBT instructors. . The IBT modules you
must do depend on your learner permit category as follows:</p>

<table border="1" style="width: 80%"><caption><strong>Initial Basic Training</strong></caption>
  <col><col><tbody><tr><td><strong>Category</strong></td>
      <td><strong>IBT training modules</strong></td>
    </tr><tr><td>AM</td>
      <td>modules 1, 2, 3 and 4</td>
    </tr><tr><td>A1</td>
      <td>modules 1, 2, 3 and 4 (if not already completed under category
      AM)</td>
    </tr><tr><td>A2</td>
      <td>modules 1, 3 and 5 on an A2 type motorcycle </td>
    </tr><tr><td>A</td>
      <td>modules 1, 3 and 5 on an A type motorcycle </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>You cannot ride a motorcycle on the road unsupervised by your IBT instructor
unless you have done your IBT training and received a certificate of
satisfactory completion.</p>

<p>If you have completed your IBT training and you want to upgrade the
motorcycle you ride to a more powerful motorcycle (or from automatic to manual
or tricycle to two-wheeler) you must complete IBT module 5. Module 5 is a
progression module and is a repeat of modules 2 and 4 as well as some
additional topics. <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Motorcyclists/Initial-basic-training-IBT-for-motorcyclists/"></a></p>

information on IBT</a> is available on the Road Safety Authority website.</p>

<p>It is a requirement to satisfactorily complete the Initial Basic Training
(IBT) programme in motorcycle driving techniques as part of the motorcycle
learner permit scheme in Ireland. </p>

<p>There are a number of driving schools offering instruction in motorcycle
driving techniques throughout Ireland. All instructors for these courses must
be approved by the Road Safet Authority. Where they are delivering IBT the IBT
centre must also be approved. </p>

<p>You must always carry a valid driving licence/learner permit for the correct
category of motorcycle you are driving. Failure to produce your driving
licence/learner permit when requested is an offence. </p>

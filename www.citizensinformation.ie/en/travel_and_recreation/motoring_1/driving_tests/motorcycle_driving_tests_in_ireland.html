<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>Driver testing of motorcycles in Ireland is carried out directly by the Road
Safety Authority to a standard that complies with the EU Directive on Driving
Licences. Testing is conducted out of <a shape="rect" href="http://www.rsa.ie/Utility/Contact-Us/Driving-Test-Centres/">test centres
throughout the country</a> and where possible, your test will be arranged for
the centre you nominate on your application form. </p>

<p>A driving test is a compulsory requirement for motorcyclists who have been
issued with two 2-year learner permits. It is important to be aware that
<span>you may not apply for a third or subsequent learner permit for any
category of vehicle unless you can show evidence you have applied for a driving
test</span>. Since December 2007 you cannot take a driving test for at least
six months after getting your first learner permit (where you are not changing
from a provisional licence to a learner permit). </p>

<p><strong></strong>Since 19 January 2013<strong>,</strong> changes have been
introduced to driver licence categories and to some of the representative
vehicles used for driving tests. You can find information on the <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Licensed-Drivers/Driving-Licence-Changes/Driving-Licence-Changes-January-2013/New-Driver-Licensing-Rules/">driver
licence categories</a> and the <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/Documents/Learner%20Drivers/Third%20Directive/Link%206%20Representative%20vehicles%20for%20the%20driving%20test%20@%2018th%20July%202012.pdf">representative
vehicles for driving tests (pdf)</a> on the Road Safety Authority's website.
Information on how it affects those who already have motorcycle learner permits
is available in a <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/Documents/Learner%20Drivers/Third%20Directive/Link%20B%20FAQ's%20Bikes.pdf">motorcycle
FAQ (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>From 30 November 2013</strong> <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Motorcyclists/Important-changes-to-motorcycle-test/">changes
to the representative vehicles</a> for categories A1, A2 and A for the
motorcycle driving test come into effect. </p>

<h3>Representative vehicle for the driving test</h3>

<p>When you do the driving test you must use a motorcycle that is
representative of the category you are being tested for. Since 19 January 2013
the representative vehicle for each category for the driving test is as
follows:</p>

<table border="1" style="width: 100%"><caption><strong>Representative vehicles for the motorcycle driving test from

    </tr></tbody></table><h3>Applying for the test</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.rsa.ie/RSA/Learner-Drivers/The-Driving-Test/Driving-Test-Centre/Waiting-Times/">Waiting
times and pass rates</a> vary from county to county so it is advisable to apply
for a test about 6 months before your second <a shape="rect" href="../driver_licensing/learner_driving_permits_for_motorcycles_in_ireland.html">learner
permit</a> is due to expire. The motorcycle driving test is a standard test and
all test centres use the same testing procedures. You should be aware that
motorcycles with sidecars attached are <span>not acceptable for use</span>
during a driving test in Ireland. You can now apply and pay for your driving
test online (see "How to apply" below).</p>

<h3>Preparing for the test</h3>

<p>A driving test is designed to determine that you:</p>
<ul><li>Know the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.rotr.ie/">Rules of the Road</a>
  </li>
  <li>Possess the knowledge and skill to drive competently in accordance with
    those rules; </li>
  <li>Drive with proper regard for the safety and convenience of other road
    users. </li>
</ul><p>Prior to your driving test, you should study the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.rsa.ie/Documents/Learner%20Drivers/Rules_of_the_road.pdf">Rules
of the Road (pdf)</a>, a booklet that is published by the Road Safety Authority
and is available in bookshops, priced â‚¬5. </p>

<p>It is also a good idea to practice driving as much as possible on all types
of roads and in all types of traffic situations. This will improve your driving
techniques and build your confidence. </p>

<h3>The test</h3>

<p>On the day of your test, you should give yourself plenty of time to arrive
at the test centre with a few minutes to spare. If your first learner permit
was issued since 6 December 2010 you will need to bring your <a href="approved_motorcycle_training_courses_in_ireland.html">Initial Basic
Training (IBT)</a> Certificate of Satisfactory Completion. When your name is
called and you are brought into the examination room, your test officially
begins. </p>

<p>The examiner will begin by asking to see your licence and ask you to sign a
form stating that the motorcycle is both roadworthy and insured. You will also
be <span>asked to confirm that safety equipment, (gloves, boots, weather-gear)
and in particular the helmet, is properly adjusted</span>. You will then have
to answer some random questions from <span>the Rules of the Road</span>. The
examiner will then accompany you to your motorcycle to begin the practical side
of your test. </p>

<p>Questions on the Rules of the Road will also include a question concerning
rear observation, road position, skidding.</p>

<h4>Technical checks</h4>

<p>Before you commence the practical test of skills, the examiner will check
your technical knowledge of your motorcycle. You will be asked how a technical
check of 3 parts of your motorcyle would be performed. The list includes,
tyres, steering, brakes, chain, reflectors, indicators, lights (including
dipping the headlight), oil level and emergency stop switch (if fitted).</p>

<p>You will also be asked to put the machine off and back on it's stand.
(Side-stands are acceptable for this purpose). You will also be asked to move
the motorcycle approximately 4/5 metres forward or backwards without the
engine.</p>

<h4>Practical test of skills</h4>

<p>You will be given clear instructions before your test on the route to take.
If you do not understand something, you should ask the examiner to repeat it.
In Ireland, motorcyclists undergoing their practical driving test of skills are
not in radio contact throughout the test with the examiner. Instead, the
examiner will be following you behind in a car. In exceptional circumstances,
i.e., very heavy traffic congestion, the tester may observe you on foot. Do not
panic if you make a mistake during the test. It may not be as serious as you
think and it may not mean you have failed. <span>Mo</span><span>torcycle
tests</span> will be carried out <span>using radio controls</span>. Equipment
will be provided at the test centre and advice on using the equipment. </p>

<p>You will be assessed in the following situations: moving off, driving in
traffic, driving left-hand circuits of a block and driving right-hand circuits.
You will also be required to do a U-turn around the width of the road to
demonstrate that you have good control of your motorcycle in a confined space.
You may lose points for using a foot to steady the bike. You will then be asked
to ride slowly, at "walking pace" for around 50 metres to demonstrate that you
have adequate control of your vehicle. </p>

<p>The aspects of your driving that will be assessed include road positioning;
overtaking and passing; anticipation and observation; use of signals; progress;
speed; compliance with traffic lights, road signs and road markings and proper
use of your vehicle controls. At some point during your test, the examiner will
ask you to demonstrate your hand signals. You can also expect to make a number
of left and right turns, encounter a roundabout and stop at traffic lights. </p>

<p>When you return to the test centre, your examiner will bring you back into
the examination room to give you the result. If you pass, you will be given a
Certificate of Competency, which is valid for 2 years. If you fail to apply for
a full licence during this 2 year period, you will have to complete your
driving test again. If you fail your driving test, you will be given a detailed
list of your mistakes, which you should study and rectify before you sit
another driving test. </p>

<p>A Certificate of Competency is <span>not a full licence</span> and it
<span>does not entitle you to drive on a motorway or to carry a pillion
passenger</span>. Your Certificate of Competency is not valid outside of
Ireland. </p>

<h3>Facilities for deaf/hard of hearing/non-English speaking motorcyclists</h3>

<p>If you have a hearing impairment, you may have an interpreter accompany you
for the oral part of the test. Your interpreter may not be your driving
instructor and he or she cannot accompany you on the practical part of your
test. The tester may show written instructions for this part of the test and
display them as appropriate; the tester may also use basic sign language. You
should also note that if the vehicle you present for the test is adapted to
suit a disability (e.g., it has additional controls), this will be signified
via codes on your full driving licence. If you have special needs, you should
indicate this on the application form for your driving test so that any
necessary arrangements will be in place when you attend for your test. </p>

<p>It is possible to apply for your driving test to be conducted through Irish.
(You will need to complete the Irish language version of the application form
and submit it as normal). If English is not your first language, you may have
an interpreter accompany you for the oral part of the test. Again, your
interpreter may not be your driving instructor and he or she cannot accompany
you on the practical part of the test. The tester may show written instructions
for this part of the test and display them as appropriate. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>There are a number of things you need to do in preparation for your
motorcycle driving test and a number of legal requirements you must comply
with.</p>
<ul><li>It is very important to check in advance that your motorcycle complies
    with any Kw restrictions on your learner permit before you attend for your
    test. If your motorcycle does not comply with restrictions, you cannot
    complete the test. See information on representative vehicles for
    motorcycle driving tests above. </li>
  <li>Current <a shape="rect" href="../motor_tax_and_insurance/motor_tax_rates.html">motor tax
    certificate</a> must be displayed on your motorcycle or in your possession
    when you present for the test. </li>
  <li>The vehicle should be roadworthy and all tyres should have a minimum
    depth of at least 1mm - the legal thread depth limit for motorcycle tyres
    in Ireland. (Note <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/si/0358.html">vehicle tyre
    tread depths in Ireland are set down in law in SI 358/1991</a>) </li>
  <li>Motorcycle must comply with <a shape="rect" href="../../vehicle_standards/lighting_of_motorcycles_in_ireland.html">regulations
    about lighting of motorcycles</a>. </li>
  <li>Indicators and brake lights should be in perfect working order. </li>
  <li>The exterior of your motorcycle should be clean. </li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The appropriate fee for the category of test must accompany your driving
test application. The fee since February 2011 is â‚¬85.</p>

<p>Payment should be made by cheque, postal order or money order. These should
be crossed and made payable to the Road Safety Authority. Fees are
non-refundable.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.rsa.ie/RSA/Learner-Drivers/The-Driving-Test/Apply-online/">apply
and pay for your driving test online here</a>. You will require a credit card
to do so - VISA or Mastercard. You also need to have a valid e-mail address.
Alternatively, you can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.rsa.ie/Documents/Learner%20Drivers/rsadrivingtestappform.pdf">download
a motorcycle driving test application form (pdf)</a> here, or obtain a copy
from your <a shape="rect" href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/LocalGovernment/MotorTax/FileDownLoad,26107,en.xls">local
Motor Taxation Office</a>. The correct fee must accompany your completed
application form. </p>

<h3>Cancelling your driving test</h3>

<p>If for some reason you are unable to sit your driving test on the day you
are given, you may cancel this test but you will have to re-apply again. You
will not forfeit your test fee if you give at least 10 days notice and if you
haven't previously cancelled more than one driving test appointment on this
application. Cancelling your driving test will mean that you go <span>back to
the end</span> of the waiting list again at the test centre.</p>

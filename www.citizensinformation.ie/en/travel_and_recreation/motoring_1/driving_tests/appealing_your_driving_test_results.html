<p>If you are unhappy with the results of your driving test in Ireland, it is
possible to appeal these results. The driving test appeals procedure is a
statutory one. That is, your right to appeal your driving test results are set
down in Irish law. The legislation that deals with your right to appeal is set
down in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1961/en/act/pub/0024/sec0033.html#zza24y1961s33">Section
33(5) of the Road Traffic Act 1961</a>. </p>

<p>Appeals against driving test results are heard in the District Court by a
judge sitting alone. That is, there is no jury involved. In order to begin
appeal proceedings, you must lodge your appeal with your local District Court
Office. </p>

<p>This can be done either by visiting the office in person or you may instruct
a solicitor to do so on your behalf. You are not obliged to have a solicitor
represent you and you may choose to represent yourself if you so wish. It is a
very straightforward process and you will receive assistance in the court from
the judge.</p>

<h2>Starting off the driving test appeal process<br></h2>

<p>To start off the appeals procedure, you must contact your local District
Court Office and supply them with a written outline of the reasons why you feel
the result of the driving test was unfair. This does not need to be in the form
of an <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/witnesses/affidavit.html">affidavit</a>
but must set out the reasons you will be relying on in during the court
hearing. Once the District Court Office receive your request they will prepare
a notice of appeal on your behalf which will be issued to the driving tester
and to the Road Safety Authority. This will put both parties (that is, you and
the Authority) on notice of your intention to appeal the test result and will
give them an opportunity to contest the matter when it comes before the
District Court.</p>

<p>A useful reference to give to the District Court Office if you wish to
appeal your test result is <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/lookuppagelink/585AC0C93975C03F8025763C005B89EB?opendocument&amp;l=en">Form
No. 97.2</a> Schedule C, <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/0c609d7abff72c1c80256d2b0045bb64/bea24040620548f080257c90005561dd?OpenDocument">Order
97</a>, rule 3(1). This reference will indicate the correct form to be used by
the Court Office in your appeal. This notice of appeal requires either your
signature or that of your solicitor, if you engage one. A small stamp duty
charge is payable by you to the District Court Office for the issue of a Notice
of Appeal.</p>

<p>The District Court Office will notify you of the time, date and place for
the hearing of your appeal. The timeframe for when your case is heard will
depend on your District Court.</p>

<h2>The hearing<br></h2>

<p>On the day of the hearing you appear in court and wait until your case is
called. Your case will be heard before a judge but with no jury present. The
case is heard in open court. That is, in public. When your case is called you
will be required to go into the witness stand and give evidence on oath as to
why you want the result of your driving test to be set aside by the judge. </p>

<p>After you have completed your evidence you may be cross-examined (asked
questions) by the driving tester or their legal representative and you may also
be asked questions by the judge. If the driving tester is in court they will
then be given an opportunity to give evidence to the court (in other words,
their version of events) and you will be entitled to question them once they
has completed their evidence.<br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In a driving test appeal the District Court is the court
of final instance. This means whatever decision is made by the judge cannot be
appealed and it is final.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Financial compensation is not available for driving test
appeal cases. A District Court judges can only make one of two decisions in a
driving test appeal case:</p>
<ul><li>
    <div>
    <strong>Your appeal is refused</strong>: the judge agrees with the decision
    of the driving tester that you failed your test.</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <strong>Your appeal is upheld</strong>: the judge is satisfied that your
    driving test was not conducted properly. You will then be offered a further
    driving test free of charge. If the judge directs another test to be
    carried out, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport must arrange to
    have it conducted by another tester.</div>
  </li>
</ul><p>It is worth noting, the court cannot enquire into the <em>findings </em>of
the tester. It can only decide whether they conducted the test with malice,
oppression or unfair conduct. This means that if the court is satisfied with
the way in which the test took place it will not order a new test.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Previous cases on these matters have been heard before the
courts. Those cases were Geraghty v Morris [1939] 2 AU E.R. 269 and Carrigan v
Fox (1966) S.L.T.79.</p>

<p>No financial compensation is available in driving test appeal cases. In
other words you will not receive any compensation for any costs associated with
either failing your test or in taking the appeal.</p>

<p>There is a small <a href="http://www.courts.ie/courts.ie/library3.nsf/pagecurrent/B1891D43DC769B2280257FB20037F683?opendocument&amp;l=en">stamp
duty payable to the District Court Office</a> on the application for a Notice
of Appeal to the District Court.</p>

<p>If your solicitor represents you in court, bear in mind that solicitors in
Ireland are required to fully inform you in writing of all professional fees in
advance. If it is not possible to give you a definite sum, they must estimate a
sum (or at the very least describe the basis upon which charges or fees will be
calculated).</p>

<p>Usually solicitors will wait until a case is conducted before requiring
payment of their fees. Sometimes fees will be requested in advance, especially
in a case where you run a high risk of losing.</p>

<p>Solicitors in Ireland charge competitive rates, so shop around and obtain
some quotes before you decide on a legal representative.<br></p>

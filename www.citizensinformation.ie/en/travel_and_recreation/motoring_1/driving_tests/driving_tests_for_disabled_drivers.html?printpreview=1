<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>All drivers (including drivers with disabilities) who have been issued with
2 two-year learner driving permits are required to undergo a driving test. This
requirement to undergo a driving test is compulsory. It is important to be
aware of the fact that <span>you may not apply for a third or subsequent
learner permit for any category of vehicle unless you can show evidence that
you have applied for a driving test.</span> You cannot take a driving test for
at least six months after getting your first learner permit (where you are not
changing from a provisional licence to a learner permit). </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="driving_test.html">Driver testing</a> is carried out
directly by the Road Safety Authority to a standard that complies with the EU
Directive on Driving Licences. Testing is conducted out of <a shape="rect" href="http://www.rsa.ie/Utility/Contact-Us/Driving-Test-Centres/">test centres
throughout the country</a> and where possible, your test will be arranged for
the centre you nominate on your application form. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.rsa.ie/RSA/Learner-Drivers/The-Driving-Test/Driving-Test-Centre/Waiting-Times/">Waiting
times </a>vary from county to county, so it is advisable to apply for a test
about 6 months before your second <a shape="rect" href="../driver_licensing/learner_driving_permits_for_cars_and_work_vehicles.html">learner
permit</a> is due to expire. It is a standard test and all test centres use the
same testing procedures. It is now possible to apply and pay for your driving
test online (see "How to apply" below). </p>

<p>You should notify the Road Safety Authority in advance if you have a severe
hearing problem or are restricted in your movements, or have any disability
which could affect your driving. If you have a disability, you are asked on
your driving test application form to outline whether you are driving an
adapted vehicle. This will ensure that any necessary arrangements are in place
for you on the day of your test. </p>

<p>Driving tests for disabled drivers are broadly the same as those for all
other motorists. In other words, your test is to determine that you: </p>
<ul><li>Know the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.rotr.ie/">Rules of the Road</a>
  </li>
  <li>Possess the knowledge and skill to drive competently in accordance with
    these rules </li>
  <li>Drive with proper regard for the safety and convenience of other road
    users. </li>
</ul><h3>Driving text examiners</h3>

<p>Driving test examiners for drivers with disabilities have been specially
trained to be aware of your needs. (They are normally supervising driving test
examiners). In addition to increased awareness of special needs, they are also
trained to ensure that if you are using an adapted vehicle, you are in control
of your vehicle appropriately at all times and can operate your adapted vehicle
safely on the road. </p>

<h3>Facilities for drivers with special needs</h3>

<p>Most driving test centres in Ireland are wheelchair-accessible. Given that
some drivers with disabilities would prefer not to conduct the first part of
their test in the centre, it is possible to have this part (i.e., the part
where you are examined on your knowledge of the Rules of the Road) in your
vehicle. You can of course opt to be tested on your knowledge of the Rules of
the Road in the test centre if you wish. Check with your test centre in advance
to see if they can facilitate wheelchair access if you would prefer this
option. </p>

<p>If you are deaf or hard of hearing, you are allowed to have an interpreter
accompany you for the first part of the test. <span>Your interpreter cannot be
your driving instructor</span> and he or she cannot accompany you on the other
practical part of your test (i.e., the test of your driving skills). The tester
may show written instructions for the first part of the test and display them
as appropriate; the tester may also use basic sign language. You should also
note that if the vehicle you present for the test is adapted to suit a
disability (e.g., it has additional controls), this will be signified on your
full driving licence via code numbers. </p>

<p>It is possible to apply for your driving test to be conducted through Irish.
(You will need to complete the Irish language version of the application form
and submit as normal). </p>

<h3>Practical test of driving skills</h3>

<p>Before your driving test commences, the examiner will ask to see your
licence and ask you to sign a form stating that the car is both roadworthy and
insured. You will then have to answer some random questions from the Rules of
the Road and explain how to do some technical checks. You now begin the
practical test of your driving skills. </p>

<p>Driving testers are aware that drivers with disabilities driving adapted
vehicles may take a little longer to complete some manoeuvres than other
drivers. This does not mean that you are authorised to drive slower during your
test; you are required to maintain the same progress on the road in line with
<a shape="rect" href="../../roads_and_safety/road_traffic_speed_limits_in_ireland.html">national
speed limits</a> as all other drivers. Instead, you are allowed a little more
time to demonstrate that you have adequate control of your vehicle and can
drive on public roads with due regard for the safety of others. In addition,
drivers who are deaf or hard of hearing are also given a little longer to go
through the practical test of skills than other drivers in the event of any
communication difficulties. </p>

<p>You will be given clear instructions throughout the test, but if you do not
understand something, ask the examiner to repeat it. Do not panic if you make a
mistake during the test. It may not be as serious as you think and it may not
mean that you have failed. </p>

<p>You will be assessed in the following situations: moving off, driving in
traffic, stopping, reversing round a corner, a turn about, a hill-start and
parking. </p>

<p>The aspects of your driving that will be assessed include road positioning;
overtaking and passing; anticipation and observation; use of mirrors and
signals; progress; speed; compliance with traffic lights, road signs and road
markings and proper use of your vehicle controls. At some point during your
test, the examiner will ask you to demonstrate your hand signals unless a
physical disability prevents this demonstration. You can also expect to make a
number of left and right turns, encounter a roundabout and stop at traffic
lights. </p>

<p>When you return to the test centre, you have the option of receiving your
results in your vehicle or the examiner will bring you back into the
examination room to give you the result. If you pass, you will be given a
Certificate of Competency, which is valid for 2 years. If you fail to apply for
a full licence during this 2-year period, you will have to complete your
driving test again. If you fail your driving test, you will be given a detailed
list of your mistakes, which you should study and rectify before you sit
another driving test. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>There are a number of things all drivers need to do in preparation for your
driving test and a number of legal requirements you must comply with.</p>
<ul><li>You must have a current learner permit to sit a driving test </li>
  <li>Current <a shape="rect" href="../motor_tax_and_insurance/motor_tax_rates.html">motor tax</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../motor_tax_and_insurance/motor_insurance.html">motor
    insurance</a> discs and an <a shape="rect" href="../../vehicle_standards/national_car_test.html">NCT certificate</a>
    (if applicable) must be displayed on the vehicle you are using </li>
  <li>L-plates should be displayed on the front and rear of the vehicle </li>
  <li>The vehicle should be roadworthy, for example, all tyres should have a
    minimum depth of 1.6mm - the legal thread depth limit for tyres in Ireland
  </li>
  <li>Everything should be in perfect working order, e.g., windscreen wipers,
    indicators, mirrors, etc. The examiner <span>will check the indicators and
    brake lights before your practical driving test</span>. </li>
  <li>The interior and exterior of your car should be clean. </li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The appropriate fee for the category of test must accompany your driving
test application. The fee for motorcycles and cars is €85. For all other
categories the fee is €120.</p>

<p>You can pay by cheque, postal order or money order. These should be crossed
and made payable to the Road Safety Authority. Fees are non-refundable</p>

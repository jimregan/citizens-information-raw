<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>A driver theory test was introduced in 2001 to supplement the practical
driving test. Prior to this, motorists were not required to undergo a test of
their knowledge of either the rules of the road or motoring legislation before
they applied for a driving licence, or completed their driving test.</p>

<p>You must pass the driver theory test before applying for a first learner
permit. If your learner permit expired 5 years ago, then you must pass the
theory test again before a learner permit will be issued.</p>

<p>EU legislation governing this area requires that citizens undergo a
practical test of their knowledge of the rules of the road and motoring
legislation.</p>

<p>Your theory test will check your knowledge about areas such as:</p>
<ul><li>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.rotr.ie/">rules of the road</a> </li>
  <li>Risk perception </li>
  <li>Eco-driving </li>
  <li>Hazard awareness </li>
  <li>Good driving behaviour </li>
</ul><p>The test is conducted at a nation-wide network of <a shape="rect" href="http://www.theorytest.ie/english/driver-theory-test/test-centre-locations.php">41
test locations</a> and uses a user-friendly computerised system. The test can
be offered in Irish and in English and candidates with special needs are
catered for.</p>

<p>A theory test certificate must be obtained before a first learner permit in
a particular vehicle category is granted.</p>

<h3>Test categories</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.theorytest.ie/english/driver-theory-test/test-types.php">categories
of test</a> are:</p>
<ul><li>A – motorcycles and mopeds (Driving licence categories AM, A1, A2,
  A),</li>
  <li>B – cars, tractors and work vehicles (Driving licence categories B, BE,
    W)</li>
  <li>C – vans and trucks over 3,500kg (Driving licence categories C, C1, CE,
    C1E)</li>
  <li>D – buses (Driving licence categories D, D1, DE, D1E)</li>
  <li>CD – trucks and buses (Driving licence categories C, C1, CE, C1E, D,
    D1, DE, D1E) </li>
  <li>TMT – truck module (must have passed D test since 30 September
  2014)</li>
  <li>BMT – bus module (must have passed C since 30 September 2014)</li>
</ul><p>If you already have a driving licence for a particular category and you want
to get a driving licence for a different category for which a different theory
test is required, you have to pass the theory test for that category before you
can apply for a learner permit. For example, if you have a driving licence for
category B and you want to get a driving licence for category C1, you have to
pass the category C theory test and then apply for a category C1 learner
permit.</p>

<p>If you pass a category C or D theory test on or after 30 September 2014,
there is an option to sit a TMT or BMT module test to obtain the other category
(D or C as appropriate) provided this is done within 2 years of the first
test.</p>

of vehicles and learner permits here</a>. </p>

<h3>Motorcycle and car tests</h3>

<p>There are 40 questions in the category A and B tests and you have to answer
35 questions correctly to be successful. You have 45 minutes to answer the 40
questions in the test.</p>

<h3>Truck and bus tests</h3>

<p>There are 100 questions in the category C and D tests and you have to answer
74 questions correctly. You have 100 minutes to answer the questions.</p>

<p>To pass the combined CD theory test, you have 140 minutes to correctly
answer 104 out of 140 questions. To pass a TMT or a BMT module theory test you
have 45 minutes to answer 30 out of 40 questions correctly.</p>

<h3>Taking the test</h3>

<p>The test is computerised and can be taken using either a touch screen or a
mouse and keyboard. The first part of the exam consists of a short tutorial,
which includes instructions on how to navigate through the exam as well as
allow you to practice answering two questions. You do not need to be computer
literate.</p>

<p>Categories A, B, C and D tests are available in Irish. If you wish to
complete your test in the Irish language, you should state that when booking
your test.</p>

<p>The format of the test is multiple choice questions. Answers are marked with
a square box beside them, where you tick one to choose the correct answer.</p>

<p>If you make a mistake or change your mind, you can cancel your answer. If
you want to skip a question, you can and then go back and answer the question
at the end of your test. Before you complete the exam, there is an option to
review all your answers and if you wish, change them.</p>

<p>The test is scored automatically and results are made available to you
immediately. You will receive a pass certificate for your theory test at the
test centre.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether you pass or fail, you will also be provided with a
score report listing the categories recommended for further study, based on
your performance.</p>

<h3>Applicants with reading or language difficulties</h3>

<p>There are various options to assist you if you have special reading
needs.</p>
<ul><li>If you have any difficulty with reading, there is a voiceover option that
    will read out the questions and answers to you over headphones. </li>
  <li>You can apply to have extra time to take your exam.</li>
  <li>A reader recorder service can be provided where a staff member will read
    the questions and answers to you and record your answer on the
  computer.</li>
  <li>Translator supported tests are available by special arrangement in
    certain test centres, if you do not understand Irish or English, even if
    provided over headphones.</li>
</ul><p>To apply for extra time, a reader recorder service or a translator supported
test you have to apply for the theory test by post. You also have to provide
evidence on official headed paper from a teacher, doctor or professional person
confirming the assistance you require.</p>

<h3>Test questions</h3>

<p>The questions you will be asked in your driver theory test are based on the
Rules of the Road and current road traffic legislation. The Driver Theory
Testing Service has a bank of questions. For each test, a random selection of
questions will be used from the question bank. The test is continually updated
depending on new and revised legislation.</p>

<h3>Learning materials</h3>

<p>The full list of test questions and answers for motorcycles and cars and for
trucks and buses are available in <a href="https://dttstore.prometric.com/products/34.html">book</a> and <a href="https://dttstore.prometric.com/products/33.html">CD</a> formats. The
CD-Roms includes practice tests, where you can sit a test and understand how
the exam works.</p>

<p>The books and the CDs are available from bookshops throughout the country,
by phone (Locall 1890 606 106) and online from the <a shape="rect" href="http://dttstore.prometric.com/">Driver Theory Testing Service</a>. This
material is not free. Some public libraries also stock this material. Contact
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.library.ie/public/index.shtml">your local
public library</a> to see if you can borrow these items. </p>

<h3>Minimum age and driver theory test</h3>

<p>There are specific minimum ages at which you may hold a learner permit for
certain vehicles in Ireland. For example, drivers of Category A1 vehicles
(i.e., certain motorcycles) must be at least 16 years of age to obtain a
learner permit. Drivers of Category B vehicles (that is, certain cars) must be
at least 17 years to hold a first learner permit. </p>

<p>In theory, you may take a driver theory test at any age. However, you must
submit your pass certificate to a <a href="https://www.ndls.ie/where-to-apply.html">National Driver Licence Service
(NDLS) centre</a> with your application for a first learner permit within two
years of passing the theory test. So for example, if you wish to apply for a
learner permit for Category B vehicles, you must be at least 15 years of age or
older when you<span></span> <span>pass your driver theory test</span> in order
to obtain a first learner permit when you reach 17 years. </p>

<p><span>Failure</span> to submit your learner permit application to an NDLS
centre within <span>2 years of passing your theory test</span> will mean the
test certificate <span>expires</span> and you will have to do the test again.
</p>

<p>There is no maximum age at which you can complete a driver theory test.</p>

<h3>Complaints procedures</h3>

<p>If you are unhappy with the result of your theory test, you have the right
to appeal this decision. Speak to the Driver Theory Test supervisor before
leaving the test centre. You may also fill out an appeal form, available at
each of the Driver Theory Test Centres. There are some rules regarding appeals.
</p>

<p>You must make your appeal within 10 working days of your test </p>

<p>When your appeal is received, your test will be re-marked and you will
receive the result within 5 to 10 working days.</p>

<p>If it emerges that the original marking was incorrect you will be issued
with your new theory test certificate. You can read more about the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.theorytest.ie/english/customer-charter.php">Driver Theory Test
Customer Charter</a> here. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Anyone who wants to apply for a first learner permit has to pass the theory

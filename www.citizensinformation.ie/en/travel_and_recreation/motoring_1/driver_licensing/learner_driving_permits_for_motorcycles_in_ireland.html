<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>It is a statutory requirement that you must hold at least a learner driving
permit (previously known as a provisional licence) for the <a href="categories_of_motor_vehicles_and_minimum_age_of_drivers_in_ireland.html">appropriate
category of motorcycle</a> if you want to drive a motorcycle in a public place.
You are required to carry your permit with you at all times when driving. </p>

<p>This document explains how to apply for or renew a learner permit for a
motorcycle. In other documents you will find information on:</p>
<ul><li><a href="updating_your_driving_licence_or_learner_permit.html">Updating
    your driving licence or learner permit</a></li>
  <li><a href="replacing_a_lost_or_stolen_irish_driving_licence.html">Replacing a
    lost, stolen or damaged driving licence or learner permit</a></li>
</ul><p>To apply for a learner permit, you must be normally resident in Ireland. If
you usually live here for at least 185 days in each calendar year (because of
personal and occupational ties), you are considered to be normally resident in
Ireland. </p>

<h3>2013 changes</h3>

<p>The Road Safety Authority now has responsibility for driver licensing and
has set up a new National Driver Licence Service (NDLS). In addition, the
application process has changed and, when applying for a learner permit, you
have to visit one of the new NDLS centres. As part of the face-to-face
application process, your photo and your signature is captured digitally. You
have to bring additional documentation to confirm your identity.</p>

<p>A new plastic-card learner permit has been introduced, replacing the paper
learner permit. This is an EU initiative to introduce a secure, compact style
of licence in all member states.</p>

<p>The number of driving licence categories has increased and the minimum age
requirement for certain categories has changed also. Further information is
available on the <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Licensed-Drivers/Driving-Licence-Changes/Driving-Licence-Changes-January-2013/New-Driver-Licensing-Rules/">Road
Safety Authority's website</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Before you learn to drive on public roads, you must hold a learner permit,
covering the category of motorcycle you wish to drive. A learner permit to
drive a motorcycle is usually valid for 2 years.</p>

<p>Learner permit holders are not allowed carry pillion passengers (passengers
on the back of their motorcycle) or drive on a motorway.</p>

<p>Motorcyclists with learner permits are required to display L-plates on a
yellow fluorescent high visibility tabard. (A tabard is a bib or sleeveless
outer garment with open side-seams). The letter 'L' must be in red and at least
15cm in height on a white background, and must be to the front and rear of your
torso. It is a criminal offence for learner motorcyclists not to display L
plates.</p>

<p>Since October 2011 the drink driving limit for drivers with learner permits
and those in their first two years on a full driving licence is reduced to
20mg/100m of blood. </p>

<p>The penalty points disqualification threshold of 12 points is reduced to 7
penalty points for those who obtain their first learner permit on or after 1
August 2014. It remains at the lower threshold while they drive under a learner
permit and subsequently during the first two years while they drive under their
first driving licence. Further information is available on the <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Licensed-Drivers/Driving-licence/Novice-Plates-Introduction/">Road
Safety Authority website</a>.</p>

<h3>Motorcycle categories</h3>

<p>Since 19 January 2013 there are 4 categories of motorcycle in Ireland that
are licensed for use on public roads. There are also specified minimum ages for
motorcyclists.</p>

motorcycles and mopeds were as follows:</p>

      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">16 years</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>* Category A learner permits issued before 19 January 2013 carry a
restriction. This restriction limits the licence holder to motorcycles (with or
without a sidecar) subject to a power limit of 25kW. This restriction continues
for 2 years after you have obtained a full driving licence for this category
providing the licence was obtained before 19 January 2013.</p>

<h3>Getting a full driving licence</h3>

<p>If you are old enough, the usual steps you must take to get a full driving
licence in a particular category is to:</p>
<ol><li>Pass the <a href="../driving_tests/driver_theory_test.html">motorcycle/moped theory
    test</a></li>
  <li>Get a learner permit for the category you wish to get a full licence
  for</li>
  <li>Complete all the appropriate <a href="../driving_tests/approved_motorcycle_training_courses_in_ireland.html">Initial
    Basic Training (IBT) modules</a> on the appropriate type of motorcycle</li>
  <li>Pass the <a href="../driving_tests/motorcycle_driving_tests_in_ireland.html">motorcycle
    driving test</a> after a minimum of 6 months on the appropriate
    representative motorcycle</li>
</ol><p>However, if you have already held a category A1 or A2 full driving licence
for at least two years it is possible to get a full licence for category A2 or
A respectively through what is called <em>progressive access</em>, without
going through all those steps. Providing you have already completed IBT
training for your existing licence, the steps you follow are:</p>
<ol><li>Get a learner permit for the category you wish to get a full licence
  for</li>
  <li>Complete the IBT progression module on the appropriate type of
  motorcycle</li>
</ol><p>You may also have to do a motorcycle driving test if you did not pass the
test for your existing licence. It is possible to get a category A learner
permit at age 20 under progressive access.</p>

<h3>Your first learner permit</h3>

<p>You must have a valid <a href="../driving_tests/driver_theory_test.html">driver theory test
certificate</a> for motoycycle and moped categories before a first motorcycle
learner permit will be granted. The theory test certificate is valid for 2
years from the date of issue. If your learner permit expired at least 5 years
ago, then you must pass the theory test again before a learner permit will be
issued.</p>

<p>You must do <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Motorcyclists/Initial-basic-training-IBT-for-motorcyclists/">Initial
Basic Training (IBT)</a> when you get your first learner permit. You cannot
ride a motorcycle on the road unsupervised by your IBT instructor unless have
done your IBT and received a certificate of satisfactory completion.</p>

<p>You cannot take a <a href="../driving_tests/motorcycle_driving_tests_in_ireland.html">driving
test</a> for at least 6 months after getting your first learner permit.</p>

<h3>Your third learner permit</h3>

<p>You may not apply for a third or subsequent learner permit unless you can
provide:</p>
<ul><li>Evidence that you have undergone a driving test for a motorbike in the
    2-year period prior to your application (a 2-year learner permit will be
    granted) or</li>
  <li>Evidence of a forthcoming test date (a 1-year learner permit will be
    granted)</li>

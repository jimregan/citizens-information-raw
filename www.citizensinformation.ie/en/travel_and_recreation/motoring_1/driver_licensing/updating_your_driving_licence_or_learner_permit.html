<p>When you apply for a driving licence or learner permit it is issued in the
name and address you supplied at that time. If you subsequently change your
name or address, it is possible to exchange your current licence or permit for
an updated one.</p>

<p>You have to supply documentary evidence of the change. Your new licence or
permit will have the same expiry date as your original licence or permit.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>While you are required to carry your driving licence or learner permit with
you at all times when driving, you are not required by law to change your
licence or permit if you change your name or address. However, it is
advisable.</p>

<p>When driving, you are required to show evidence of your licence or permit if
requested to by <a href="../../../justice/law_enforcement/garda_siochana_national_police_force.html">An
Garda Síochána</a>, so your licence or permit should contain up-to-date
information.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>There is no charge for changing your name or address.</p>

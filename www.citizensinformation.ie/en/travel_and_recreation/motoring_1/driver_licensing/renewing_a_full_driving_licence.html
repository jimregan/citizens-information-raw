<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l07de2">Introduction </h2>

<p>You are required to carry your driving licence with you at all times when
driving. When your driving licence expires, you must renew it if you wish to
continue driving. This document explains how to renew your driving licence.</p>

<p>If your licence is lost, stolen or damaged, you should read our document on
<a href="replacing_a_lost_or_stolen_irish_driving_licence.html">replacing a
lost, stolen or damaged driving licence</a>.</p>

<p>To apply for a driving licence, you must be normally resident in Ireland.
You are considered to be normally resident in Ireland if, because of personal
and occupational ties, you usually live here for at least 185 days in each
calendar year.</p>

<h3>2013 changes</h3>

<p>The Road Safety Authority now has responsibility for driver licensing and
has set up a new National Driver Licence Service (NDLS). In addition, the
application process has changed and, when applying for a driving licence, you
have to visit one of the new NDLS centres. As part of the face-to-face
application process, your photo and your signature is captured digitally. You
have to bring additional documentation to confirm your identity.</p>

<p>A new plastic-card driving licence has been introduced, replacing the paper
driving licence. This is an EU initiative to introduce a secure, compact style
of licence in all member states.</p>

<p>The number of driving licence categories has increased and the minimum age
requirement for certain categories has changed also. Further information is
available on the <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Licensed-Drivers/Driving-Licence-Changes/Driving-Licence-Changes-January-2013/New-Driver-Licensing-Rules/">Road
Safety Authority's website</a>.</p>

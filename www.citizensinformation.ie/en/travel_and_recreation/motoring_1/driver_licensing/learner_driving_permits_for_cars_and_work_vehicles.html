<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="leb1f9">Information </h2>

<p>It is a statutory requirement that you must hold at least a learner driving
permit (previously known as a provisional licence) for the <a href="categories_of_motor_vehicles_and_minimum_age_of_drivers_in_ireland.html">appropriate
category of vehicle</a> if you want to drive a car or work vehicle in a public
place. You are required to carry your learner permit with you at all times when
driving.</p>

<p>This document explains how to apply for or renew a learner permit for a car
or work vehicle. In other documents you will find information on:</p>
<ul><li><a href="updating_your_driving_licence_or_learner_permit.html">Updating
    your driving licence or learner permit</a></li>
  <li><a href="replacing_a_lost_or_stolen_irish_driving_licence.html">Replacing a
    lost, stolen or damaged driving licence or learner permit</a></li>
</ul><p>To apply for a learner permit, you must be normally resident in Ireland. If
you usually live here for at least 185 days in each calendar year (because of
personal and occupational ties), you are considered to be normally resident in
Ireland. </p>

<h3>2013 changes</h3>

<p>The Road Safety Authority now has responsibility for driver licensing and
has set up a new National Driver Licence Service (NDLS). In addition, the
application process has changed and, when applying for a learner permit, you
have to visit one of the new NDLS centres. As part of the face-to-face
application process, your photo and your signature is captured digitally. You
have to bring additional documentation to confirm your identity.</p>

<p>A new plastic-card learner permit has been introduced, replacing the paper
learner permit. This is an EU initiative to introduce a secure, compact style
of licence in all member states.</p>

<p>The number of driving licence categories has increased and the minimum age
requirement for certain categories has changed also. Further information is
available on the <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Licensed-Drivers/Driving-Licence-Changes/Driving-Licence-Changes-January-2013/New-Driver-Licensing-Rules/">Road
Safety Authority's website</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Before you begin to learn to drive on public roads in Ireland, you must hold
a learner permit covering the category of vehicle you wish to drive. A learner
permit to drive a car or work vehicle is usually valid for 2 years</p>

<p>Car drivers with a learner permit must be accompanied at all times by, and
be under the supervision of, someone with a current driving licence for a car.
Also, the person accompanying you must have had the driving licence for at
least 2 years.</p>

<p>Work vehicle drivers with a learner permit are not allowed to carry a
passenger unless the vehicle is designed to carry a passenger and the passenger
is a qualified driver who has held his driving licence for a work vehicle for
the last 2 years at least.</p>

<p>If you hold a learner permit for a car, you are not allowed to drive a car
drawing a trailer, drive on a motorway, act as an accompanying driver or carry
other people for reward.</p>

<p>Learner permit holders for cars must display L-plates to the front and rear
of the vehicle they are driving at all times. The plate should be a red ‘L’
on a white background and should not be less than 15cm high with a border of at
least 2cm.</p>

<p>Since October 2011 the drink driving limit for car drivers with learner
permits and those in their first two years on a full driving licence is reduced
to 20mg/100ml of blood. It applies to all drivers of work vehicles. </p>

<p>The penalty points disqualification threshold of 12 points is reduced to 7
penalty points for those who obtain their first learner permit on or after 1
August 2014. It remains at the lower threshold while they drive under a learner
permit and subsequently during the first two years while they drive under their
first driving licence. Further information is available on the <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Licensed-Drivers/Driving-licence/Novice-Plates-Introduction/">Road
Safety Authority website</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Your-learner-permit/Rules-of-the-road/">rules
of the road</a> are available at <a href="http://www.rulesoftheroad.ie/">rulesoftheroad.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>Car and work vehicle categories</h3>

<p>The categories and driver's minimum age for car and work vehicles are as
follows:</p>

<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" border="1" width="600" summary="Car and work vehicle categories"><caption><strong>Car and work vehicle categories</strong></caption>
  <thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><strong>Category</strong></td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>Vehicle type</strong></td>
      <td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><strong>Minimum age of driver</strong></td>
    </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">B</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Vehicles with seats for a maximum of 8
        passengers and a maximum weight of 3,500kg (can tow a trailer where the
        maximum weight of the trailer when fully loaded is 750kg or less)</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">17 years</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">W</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Work vehicles with or without a trailer, such
        as a land tractor or JCB</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">16 years</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><h3>Your first learner permit</h3>

<p>You must have a valid <a href="../driving_tests/driver_theory_test.html">driver theory test
certificate</a> for car and work vehicle categories before a first learner
permit will be granted. If your learner permit expired 5 years ago, then you
must pass the theory test again before a learner permit will be issued.</p>

<p>Since 4 April 2011 new first-time category B learner permit holders are
required to undertake mandatory <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Driver-Training/Car-Training-EDT/">essential
driver training (EDT)</a> of 12 one-hour lessons with an approved driving
instructor. Your progress is recorded in a special logbook. You should also
have an experienced driver who supervises your driving practice outside of
lessons, and also updates your logbook. When taking the driving test, you may
be required to show your completed logbook to the examiner.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Finding-an-instructor/Find-an-instructor/">list
of approved driving instructors</a> is available on the Road Safety
Authority’s website.</p>

<p>You cannot take a <a href="../driving_tests/driving_test.html">driving
test</a> for at least 6 months after getting your first learner permit.</p>

<h3>Your third learner permit</h3>

<p>You may not apply for a third or subsequent learner permit unless you can
provide:</p>
<ul><li>Evidence that you have undergone a driving test in the 2-year period
    prior to the application (a 2-year learner permit will be granted) or</li>
  <li>Evidence of a forthcoming test date (a 1-year learner permit will be
    granted)</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rates">

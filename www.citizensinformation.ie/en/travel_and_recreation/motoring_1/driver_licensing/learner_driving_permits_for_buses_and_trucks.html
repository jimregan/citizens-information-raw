<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>It is a statutory requirement that you must hold at least a learner driving
permit (previously known as a provisional licence) for the <a href="categories_of_motor_vehicles_and_minimum_age_of_drivers_in_ireland.html">appropriate
category of vehicle</a> if you want to drive a bus or truck in a public place.
You are required to carry your learner permit with you at all times when
driving.</p>

<p>This document explains how to apply for or renew a learner permit for a bus
or truck. In other documents you will find information on:</p>
<ul><li><a href="updating_your_driving_licence_or_learner_permit.html">Updating
    your driving licence or learner permit</a></li>
  <li><a href="replacing_a_lost_or_stolen_irish_driving_licence.html">Replacing a
    lost, stolen or damaged driving licence or learner permit</a></li>
</ul><p>To apply for a learner permit, you must be normally resident in Ireland. If
you usually live here for at least 185 days in each calendar year (because of
personal and occupational ties), you are considered to be normally resident in
Ireland.</p>

<h3>2013 changes</h3>

<p>The Road Safety Authority now has responsibility for driver licensing and
has set up a new National Driver Licence Service (NDLS). In addition, the
application process has changed and, when applying for a learner permit, you
have to visit one of the new NDLS centres. As part of the face-to-face
application process, your photo and your signature is captured digitally. You
have to bring additional documentation to confirm your identity.</p>

<p>A new plastic-card learner permit has been introduced, replacing the paper
learner permit. This is an EU initiative to introduce a secure, compact style
of licence in all member states.</p>

<p>The number of driving licence categories has increased and the minimum age
requirement for certain categories has changed also. Further information is
available on the <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Licensed-Drivers/Driving-Licence-Changes/Driving-Licence-Changes-January-2013/New-Driver-Licensing-Rules/">Road
Safety Authority's website</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Before you begin to learn to drive on public roads in Ireland, you must hold
a learner permit covering the category of bus or truck you wish to drive. A
learner permit to drive a bus or truck is usually valid for 2 years.</p>

<p>Bus and truck drivers with a learner permit must be accompanied at all times
by, and be under the supervision of, someone with a current driving licence for
the same type of vehicle. Also, the person accompanying you must have had the
driving licence for at least 2 years.</p>

<p>If you hold a learner permit for a bus or truck, you are not allowed to
drive while drawing a trailer, drive on a motorway, act as an accompanying
driver or carry other people for reward.</p>

<p>Learner permit holders must display L-plates to the front and rear of the
vehicle they are driving at all times. The plate should be a red ‘L’ on a
white background and should not be less than 15cm high with a border of at
least 2cm.</p>

<p>Since October 2011 the drink driving limit for drivers of buses and trucks
with learner permits or full driving licences is reduced to 20mg/100ml of
blood. <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/Utility/News/2010/RSA-announce-nine-additional-measures-to-protect-learner-and-inexperienced-drivers/">Information
on other proposed measures</a> to protect learner and inexperienced drivers is
available on the Road Safety Authority's website.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Your-learner-permit/Rules-of-the-road/">rules
of the road</a> are available at <a href="http://www.rulesoftheroad.ie/">rulesoftheroad.ie</a>.</p>

and truck FAQ (pdf)</a> on the Road Safety Authority's website.</p>

<h3>Your first learner permit</h3>

<p>You must have a valid <a href="../driving_tests/driver_theory_test.html">driver theory test
certificate</a> for category C if you wish to drive a truck and category D if
you want to drive a bus, before a first learner permit will be granted. If your
learner permit expired 5 years ago, then you must pass the theory test again
before a learner permit will be issued.</p>

<p>You must also be the holder of a driving licence for category B (car) before
a first learner permit for a bus or truck will be issued.</p>

<h3>Your third learner permit</h3>

<p>You may not apply for a third or subsequent learner permit unless you can
provide:</p>
<ul><li>Evidence that you have undergone a driving test in the 2-year period
    prior to the application (a 2-year learner permit will be granted) or</li>
  <li>Evidence of a forthcoming test date (a 1-year learner permit will be
    granted)</li>
</ul><h3>Driver Certificate of Professional Competence</h3>

<p>You need a Driver Certificate in Professional Competence (CPC) to be a
professional truck or bus driver. To get a Driver CPC you first have to pass
the driver theory test and get your learner driver permit. You must then pass
all of the following:</p>
<ul><li>A Driver CPC multiple choice theory test</li>
  <li>A Driver CPC case study theory test</li>
  <li>The driving test</li>
  <li>A Driver CPC practical test</li>
</ul><p>To keep your Driver CPC you have to undergo 7 hours training each year.</p>

<p>The Road Safety Authority's website provides <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/RSA/Professional-Drivers/Driver-Hours/">information on
the Driver CPC</a>.</p>

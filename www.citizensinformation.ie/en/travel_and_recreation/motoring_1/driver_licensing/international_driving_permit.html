<h3>What is an international driving permit?</h3>

<p>An international driving permit is a translation of your driving licence
that allows motorists to drive vehicles in other countries without further
tests or applications. If you have an international driving permit, you must
carry your driving licence with it when driving. If you are travelling abroad
and wish to drive in another country, you will very likely require an
international driving permit. International driving permits issued in Ireland
are only available to Irish residents with a current full driving licence.</p>

<p>There are two types of international driving permit issued in Ireland: </p>
<ul><li>A 1949 Convention International Driving Permit, which is the most
    commonly issued driving permit and is recognised in most countries </li>
  <li>A 1926 Convention International Driving Permit, which is required for the
    following countries - Brazil, Iraq, Nigeria and Somalia. </li>
</ul><h3>Where can I use my international driving permit?</h3>

<p>You can use your international driving permit in any of the countries that
have signed the 1926 or 1949 UN Convention on road traffic. The list of
countries that recognise international permits is not available online. Contact
AA Travel Services for more information (see below). </p>

<p>Many other countries that are not signatories to the 1949 convention
recognise the international driving permit and accept it in their territory.
Contact your embassy or consulate in advance of travel to check whether or not
an international driving permit is required in the country you will be
visiting. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>An international driving permit is available to Irish residents, who possess
a current full Irish driving licence. European Union/European Economic Area
citizens who are in possession of a full driving permit from a competent
authority in their own country and who are resident in Ireland can also obtain
an international driving permit in Ireland that is valid for use abroad. </p>

<p>You cannot be issued with an international driving permit in Ireland if:</p>
<ul><li>You have not passed your driving test and have a learner permit (or
    provisional driving licence) </li>
  <li>Your driving licence is due to expire within 6 months </li>
  <li>You are from outside the European Union or the European Economic Area.
    The European Economic Area consists of the 28 member states of the EU and
    Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. </li>
</ul><p>You should always carry your own driving permit – even when you have an
international driving permit – when travelling abroad, as you may be required
to produce this licence for inspection, for example, when hiring a car abroad.
</p>

<p>Each international driving permit is valid for one year from date of issue.

<div class="topic base_rates">

<p>For postal deliveries a €5 postal charge will also apply per permit

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>The application process is the same whether you are applying for an
international driving permit or renewing it. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.theaa.ie/AA/Motoring-advice/Driving-in-Europe/~/media/Files/AA%20Ireland/Application%20Forms/International-Driving-Permit-05-2013.ashx">Download

form is also available from AA Travel Services at the address below. </p>

<p>Your application must be accompanied by: </p>
<ul><li>A full, valid Irish driving licence or a full valid driving permit from
    another European Union or European Economic Area country </li>
  <li>A passport photograph signed on the back </li>
  <li>The appropriate fee </li>
</ul><p>If you are from a European Union/European Economic Area country and possess

<p>When you pass a <a href="../driving_tests/driving_test.html">driving
test</a> you are entitled to apply for a driving licence for the <a href="categories_of_motor_vehicles_and_minimum_age_of_drivers_in_ireland.html">category
of vehicle</a> which you were tested for. This document explains how to apply
for your driving licence after you have passed a driving test. In other
documents you will find information on:</p>
<ul><li><a href="renewing_a_full_driving_licence.html">Renewing your driving
    licence</a></li>
  <li><a href="updating_your_driving_licence_or_learner_permit.html">Updating
    your driving licence or learner permit</a></li>

  <li><a href="exchanging_foreign_driving_permit.html">Converting your
    driving licence to an Irish driving licence</a></li>
</ul><p>To apply for a driving licence, you must be normally resident in Ireland.
You are considered to be normally resident in Ireland if, because of personal
and occupational ties, you usually live here for at least 185 days in each
calendar year.</p>

<p>You are required to carry your driving licence with you at all times when
driving. The <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Your-learner-permit/Rules-of-the-road/">rules
of the road</a> are available at <a href="http://www.rulesoftheroad.ie/">rulesoftheroad.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>2013 changes</h3>

<p>The Road Safety Authority now has responsibility for driver licensing and
has set up a new National Driver Licence Service (NDLS). In addition, the
application process has changed and, when applying for a driving licence, you
have to visit one of the new NDLS centres. As part of the face-to-face
application process, your photo and your signature is captured digitally. You
have to bring additional documentation to confirm your identity.</p>

<p>A new plastic-card driving licence has been introduced, replacing the paper
driving licence. This is an EU initiative to introduce a secure, compact style
of licence in all member states.</p>

<p>The number of driving licence categories has increased and the minimum age
requirement for certain categories has changed also. Further information is
available on the <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Licensed-Drivers/Driving-Licence-Changes/Driving-Licence-Changes-January-2013/New-Driver-Licensing-Rules/">Road
Safety Authority's website</a>.</p>

<h3>Restrictions on novice drivers</h3>

<h4>Novice plates</h4>

<p>If you obtain your first driving licence on or after 1st August 2014, you
must display N-plates on your vehicle when driving for a period of 2 years.
Motorcycle riders must wear an N-tabard. The novice period only applies once.
It does not apply to a first driving licence obtained for a different category
of vehicle after the original 2-year period ends. Further information is
available on the <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Licensed-Drivers/Driving-licence/Novice-Plates-Introduction/">Road
Safety Authority website</a>.</p>

<h4>Disqualification threshold</h4>

<p>The penalty points disqualification threshold of 12 points is reduced to 7
penalty points for those who obtain their first learner permit on or after 1
August 2014. It remains at the lower threshold while they drive under a learner
permit and subsequently during the first two years while they drive under their
first driving licence. Further information is available on the <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Licensed-Drivers/Driving-licence/Novice-Plates-Introduction/">Road
Safety Authority website</a>.</p>

<h4>Drink driving limit</h4>

<p>The drink driving limits for drivers in their first 2 years on a full
driving licence is reduced to 20mg/100ml of blood.</p>

<h4>Category A driving licences</h4>

<p>Category A (motorcycle) driving licences issued before 19 January 2013 carry
a restriction. This restriction limits the driving licence holder to
motorcycles (with or without a sidecar) with a power limit of 25Kw or less.
This restriction continues for 2 years after you complete your motorcycle
driving test for this category and after you have obtained a full driving
licence for this category. This restriction does not apply to category A
driving licences issued since 19 January 2013. If you hold a category A driving
licence to which this restriction applies and want to remove the restriction
before the 2 years have elapsed, you will have to do <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Motorcyclists/Initial-basic-training-IBT-for-motorcyclists/">Initial
Basic Training (IBT)</a> progression module 5 (and modules 1 and 3 if not
already done) on a motorcycle greater than 40kW.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You are entitled to apply for a driving licence if you have passed the
driving test for that category of vehicle within the previous 2 years. If the
Certificate of Competency you were issued with is over 2 years old, you will

    for a licence that will expire the day before your 70th birthday</li>

    3-year licence</li>
  <li>If you are over the age of 70, you will need a certification of fitness
    to drive from your doctor to apply for a 3-year or a one-year licence</li>
</ul><p>A bus or truck driving licence is issued for a maximum of 5 years.</p>

purposes. You can read more in our document on <a href="categories_of_motor_vehicles_and_minimum_age_of_drivers_in_ireland.html">categories
of vehicles and minimum ages of drivers</a>.</p>

licence for certain other categories of driving licence. See ‘Further
information’ below.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>It is a statutory requirement that you must hold at least a learner driving
permit (previously known as a provisional licence) for the <a href="categories_of_motor_vehicles_and_minimum_age_of_drivers_in_ireland.html">appropriate
category of vehicle and trailer</a> if you want to drive while pulling a
trailer weighing more than 750kg when fully loaded, in a public place. You are
required to carry your learner permit with you at all times when driving.</p>

<p>This document explains how to apply for or renew a learner permit for a
trailer. In other documents you will find information on:</p>
<ul><li><a href="updating_your_driving_licence_or_learner_permit.html">Updating
    your driving licence or learner permit</a></li>
  <li><a href="replacing_a_lost_or_stolen_irish_driving_licence.html">Replacing a
    lost, stolen or damaged driving licence or learner permit</a></li>
</ul><p>To apply for a learner permit, you must be normally resident in Ireland. If
you usually live here for at least 185 days in each calendar year (because of
personal and occupational ties), you are considered to be normally resident in
Ireland. </p>

<h3>2013 changes</h3>

<p>The Road Safety Authority now has responsibility for driver licensing and
has set up a new National Driver Licence Service (NDLS). In addition, the
application process has changed and, when applying for a learner permit, you
have to visit one of the new NDLS centres. As part of the face-to-face
application process, your photo and your signature is captured digitally. You
have to bring additional documentation to confirm your identity.</p>

<p>A new plastic-card learner permit has been introduced, replacing the paper
learner permit. This is an EU initiative to introduce a secure, compact style
of licence in all member states.</p>

<p>The number of driving licence categories has increased and the minimum age
requirement for certain categories has changed also. Further information is
available on the <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Licensed-Drivers/Driving-Licence-Changes/Driving-Licence-Changes-January-2013/New-Driver-Licensing-Rules/">Road
Safety Authority's website</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Before you begin to learn to drive while pulling a trailer with a maximum
weight greater than 750kg on public roads, you must hold a learner permit for
the category of drawing vehicle plus trailer you wish to drive. A learner
permit is usually valid for 2 years.</p>

<p>While driving with a learner permit, you must be accompanied at all times
by, and be under the supervision of, someone with a current driving licence for
the same category of drawing vehicle plus trailer. Also, the person
accompanying you must have had the driving licence for at least 2 years.</p>

<p>If you hold a learner permit for a vehicle and trailer category, you are not
allowed to drive on a motorway, act as an accompanying driver for that category
or carry other people for reward.</p>

<p>Learner permit holders must display L-plates to the front and rear of the
vehicle they are driving at all times. The plate should be a red ‘L’ on a
white background and should not be less than 15cm high with a border of at
least 2cm.</p>

<p>Since October 2011 the drink driving limit for drivers with trailers with
learner permits or full driving licences is reduced to 20mg/100ml of blood. <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/Utility/News/2010/RSA-announce-nine-additional-measures-to-protect-learner-and-inexperienced-drivers/">Information
on other proposed measures</a> to protect learner and inexperienced drivers is
available on the Road Safety Authority's website.</p>

<h3>Your first learner permit</h3>

example, to get a first learner permit for category CE you must have a current
driving licence for category C.</p>

<p>If your provisional licence or learner permit for drawing a trailer expired
5 years ago, then your application will be regarded as applying for a first
learner permit.</p>

<p>You may not apply for a third or subsequent learner permit unless you can
provide:</p>
<ul><li>Evidence that you have undergone a driving test in the 2-year period
    prior to the application (a 2-year learner permit will be granted) or</li>
  <li>Evidence of a forthcoming test date (a 1-year learner permit will be
    issued)</li>

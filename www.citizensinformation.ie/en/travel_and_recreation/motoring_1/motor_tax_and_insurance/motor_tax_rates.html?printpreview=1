<div class="topic">

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l07de2">Introduction </h2>

<p>It is a legal requirement to have motor tax if you want to drive your
vehicle in a public place. Motor tax is a charge imposed by the Government on
some motor vehicles. Motor tax is collected by local authorities.</p>

<p>How your vehicle is assessed for motor tax depends on the type of vehicle
you have. For example, it is assessed on the basis of:</p>
<ul><li>CO2 emission bands for private cars registered since July 2008 and
    private cars registered between January and June 2008 which opted for this
    basis of assessment. (Does not apply to second-hand imports that were
    registered abroad prior to 2008)</li>
  <li>Engine capacity (cc) for private cars registered before July 2008 and
    private goods vehicles, such as vans</li>
  <li>Unladen weight for commercial goods vehicles</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Not only are you obliged by law to pay motor tax to drive your vehicle, you
are also required to display evidence that you have paid (that is, a current
tax disc) on the windscreen of your vehicle. Failure to display a current tax
disc on your vehicle is considered a motoring offence and will result in a
€60 fixed-charge fine issued by a traffic warden or a Garda.</p>

<p>Certain vehicles are exempt from the requirement to pay motor tax. However,
if they are used in a public place a current tax disc must be displayed. Among
the vehicles exempt from the requirement to pay motor tax are:</p>
<ul><li>Vehicles exempted under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/si/0353.html">Disabled Drivers
    and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994 (SI
    353/1994)</a></li>
  <li>Vehicles (including any cycle with an attachment for propelling it by
    mechanical power) not exceeding 400 kg in weight (unladen), which is
    adapted and used for invalids</li>
</ul><p>You can find a list of exempt vehicles in the <a href="http://www.environ.ie/motor-tax-rates-january-2016">motor tax tables</a>
which are available on the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local
Government website.</p>

<p>Since January 2016, the rate of motor tax is reduced for all commercial
goods vehicles above 4,000kgs, with a new annual rate of €500 for vehicle
between 4,000 kg and 12,000 kg and €900 for vehicles over 12,000 kg.</p>

<h3>Change of vehicle ownership and motor tax</h3>

<p>If you sell your vehicle or trade it in for a replacement, you must register
the change of ownership. This is done in one of two ways and depends on whether
the vehicle was first registered before or after 1 January 1993. You cannot tax
your new vehicle until the registration of the change of ownership has gone
through. You can <a href="https://www.motortax.ie/PSE/start.do?page=welcome">check the status of
the vehicle</a> on motortax.ie.</p>

<p>You then renew the motor tax on the vehicle using Form RF100A or online as
described below. If the motor tax on your new vehicle has already expired, you
are not liable for the arrears period from the expiry of the last tax disc to
the end of the month immediately preceding the date you bought it.</p>

<p>It is an offence to drive without paying motor tax, so you should not drive
until you have received confirmation that the registration has occurred and you
have paid the motor tax. Read more in our document on <a href="../buying_or_selling_a_vehicle/change_of_ownership.html">change of
vehicle ownership.</a></p>

<h3>Replacing a lost tax disc</h3>

<p>It is possible to obtain replacement documents associated with motor tax.
List of documents and the cost of their replacement is as follows;</p>

<table border="1"><caption></caption>
  <col><col><tbody><tr><td>Document</td>
      <td>Replacement cost </td>
    </tr><tr><td>Tax disc</td>
      <td>€6</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Registration book/certificate </td>
      <td>€12</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Vehicle licensing certificate</td>
      <td>€12</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>To obtain replacement documents, complete <a href="https://www.motortax.ie/OMT/pdf/RF134_en.pdf">Form RF134 (pdf)</a> and
have this form witnessed by a member of the Garda Síochána at a <a href="http://www.garda.ie/Stations/Default.aspx">Garda station</a>. Forward
your completed form with the appropriate fee to your Motor Tax Office.</p>

<h3>Refunds of motor tax</h3>

<p>It is possible in certain circumstances, to claim a refund of motor tax.
Your application for a refund, should be made directly to your local motor tax
office, on <a href="https://www.motortax.ie/OMT/pdf/RF120_en.pdf">Form RF120
(pdf)</a>. Circumstances where you may claim a refund of motor tax include;</p>
<ul><li>The vehicle has been scrapped/destroyed or sent permanently out of the
    State</li>
  <li>The vehicle has been stolen and has not been recovered by the owner</li>
  <li>The vehicle has not been taken out or used in a public place at any time
    since the issue of the current disc</li>
  <li>The owner of the vehicle has ceased, because of illness, injury or other
    physical disability, to use the vehicle</li>
  <li>The owner of the vehicle has ceased, because of absence from the state
    for business or educational purposes, to use the vehicle</li>
  <li>The owner of the vehicle has ceased, because of service overseas with the
    Defence Forces, to use the vehicle</li>
</ul><p>Tax discs must be surrendered immediately as refunds are generally
calculated from the first of the month following the surrender of the disc. A
minimum of three unexpired whole calendar months must be left on the disc when
surrendered. Where a vehicle has been scrapped you will need a certificate of
destruction issued by an <a href="../buying_or_selling_a_vehicle/how_to_dispose_of_an_end_of_life_vehicle.html">End-of-Life
Vehicle (ELV) Authorised Treatment Facility</a>.</p>

<h3>Vehicle off the road</h3>

<p>New procedures have been introduced for declaring a vehicle is temporarily
off the road so that you do not have to pay motor tax for that period. Since 1
October 2013 you are required to declare in advance that your vehicle will be
off the road and not in use for a period of between 3 and 12 months using <a href="https://www.motortax.ie/OMT/pdf/RF150_en.pdf">Declaration of Non-Use of a
Motor Vehicle Form RF150 (pdf)</a>, which you submit to your motor tax office.
The declaration of non-use must be made in the same month that your current
motor tax disc expires. If arrears in motor tax are due these must be paid in
full and you must also pay a minimum of 3 months motor tax, before a
declaration of non-use can be made.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>A motor tax disc is issued for 3, 6 or 12 months and how the rate is
calculated depends on the type of vehicle.</p>

<p>Motor tax applies to the following vehicles: private cars, motorcycles,
goods vehicles, taxis, large public service vehicles, (PSV's)/community buses
and agricultural, and commercial building construction vehicles. On the
Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government's website you can
<a href="http://www.environ.ie/motor-tax-rates-january-2016">view the motor tax
rates</a>. Motor tax rates are also available at <a href="https://www.motortax.ie/OMT/welcome.do">motortax.ie</a>.</p>

<p>On the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) Power of One website
you can <a href="http://www.seai.ie/Power_of_One/Getting_Around/HCIYC/">check
the CO2 emissions levels for different car models</a>.</p>

<p>A 'vintage' vehicle for motor taxation purposes is a vehicle that is 30 or
more years old. In determining whether or not the vehicle qualifies for
'vintage' status - the chassis number of the vehicle and the vehicle
registration book/vehicle registration certificate must clearly display the age
of the vehicle.</p>

<p>Regarding the purchase of new or second-hand vehicles, there is no charge
for registering Change of Ownership details at Motor Taxation Offices or at the
Vehicle Registration Unit.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You can tax a vehicle online, or by post or visit to a Motor Taxation Office
in the county in which the vehicle is ordinarily kept.</p>

<h3>Taxing a new vehicle</h3>

<p>If your vehicle is new, you need a 'First Motor Tax Application' Form RF100.
This is available from the motor dealer or person from whom you bought your
vehicle. When you are applying for first motor tax, you must present the
following documents at your local Motor Taxation Office:</p>
<ul><li>Form RF100 (<a href="http://www.environ.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/rf100-motorcycle-may2016.pdf">motorcycle
    (pdf)</a>, <a href="http://www.environ.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/rf100-vehicle-may2016.pdf">other
    vehicle (pdf)</a>)</li>
  <li>Appropriate fee.</li>
</ul><p>A certificate of approval from Revenue for a disabled driver/passenger is
also required if the vehicle is exempted from motor tax under the Disabled
Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations.</p>

<p>You can also tax a new vehicle online. (see below)</p>

<h4>Goods or commercial vehicles</h4>

<p>There are additional requirements when taxing a goods/commercial vehicle. If
the unladen weight exceeds 1,524 kg (3,500 kg Gross Vehicle Weight), a weight
docket (from an authorised weighbridge) is required.</p>

<p>If the unladen weight does not exceed 1,524 kg (3,500 kg Gross Vehicle
Weight), a <a href="https://www.motortax.ie/OMT/pdf/RF111A_en.pdf">goods
declaration form RF111A (pdf)</a> (from Motor Tax Office) is required. This
must be witnessed in a Garda station.</p>

<p>Additional proof that the vehicle is being appropriately taxed may be
required, such as:</p>
<ul><li>Current commercial insurance certificate for the vehicle</li>
  <li>Evidence of registration for VAT</li>
  <li>Tax Clearance Certificate</li>
  <li>Notice of Tax Registration Form</li>
</ul><p>If you are an employee and you use your vehicle solely for the carriage of
goods in the course of your employment, you will require a letter from your
employer to that effect. The letter should also provide information about your
employer, such as, the nature of the business and its Tax Registration
Number.</p>

<p>If the vehicle is one year old or over (for example, imported) a certificate
of roadworthiness/pass statement (from an authorised tester) is required. If
the vehicle is imported, a weight docket (from an authorised weighbridge) is
required.</p>

<h4>Other vehicles</h4>

<p>Other vehicles have additional requirements as follows:</p>
<ul><li>PSV licence in the case of small and large public service vehicles</li>
  <li>Article 60 licence for school buses</li>
  <li>A certificate of roadworthiness/pass statement issued by an authorised
    tester for large public service vehicles and ambulances that are 1 year old
    or over</li>
  <li>A recovery vehicle declaration Form RF111B (from Motor Tax Office) for
    recovery vehicles</li>
</ul><h3>Renewing your motor tax</h3>

<p>You can renew your motor tax up to 1 month before your tax is due to expire.
In general, two forms are available for the purpose of renewing motor tax - <a href="https://www.motortax.ie/OMT/pdf/RF100A_en.pdf">Motor Tax Renewal Form
RF100A (pdf)</a> and Motor Tax Renewal Form RF100B. The only difference between
these two forms is that the RF100B is a computer-printed form which is
automatically posted to you about a month before your tax is due to expire,
while the RF100A is available from your Motor Taxation Offices, public
libraries and Garda stations.</p>

<p>Not everyone receives a form in the post, so it is up to you to keep check
of when your tax expires. The completed form should be returned to your local
Motor Taxation Office in person or by post. (See 'Taxing your vehicle online'
below.) If you apply in person you will receive your new tax disc there and
then. If you make a postal application, you should allow up to 3 weeks to
receive your new disc.</p>
<ul><li>To renew your motor tax where there is no change in owner or vehicle
    details (for example, name, address, or engine size) you can complete Form
    RF100B (computerised reminder form) or Form RF100A</li>
  <li>To renew your motor tax where there is a change in owner details (for
    example, name) you must use Form RF100A</li>
  <li>To renew your motor tax where there is a change in vehicle details (for
    example, engine size) you must use <a href="https://www.motortax.ie/OMT/pdf/RF111_en.pdf">Change of Particulars
    Form RF111 (pdf)</a></li>
</ul><p>The appropriate fee must be submitted with your renewal form. A certificate
of approval from Revenue for a disabled driver or passenger is also required if
the vehicle is exempted from motor tax.</p>

<h4>Goods and other vehicles</h4>

<p>There are additional requirements for goods and other vehicles when renewing
your motor tax:</p>
<ul><li>A certificate of roadworthiness (CRW) issued by an authorised tester for
    all goods vehicles, buses, coaches and ambulances that are 1 year old or
    over</li>
  <li>A PSV licence for small and large public service vehicles</li>
  <li>Article 60 licence for school buses</li>
</ul><h3>Taxing your vehicle online</h3>

<p>At <a href="http://www.motortax.ie/">motortax.ie</a> you can tax a new
vehicle or renew your motor tax online. When taxing a new vehicle you need Form
RF100 (available from you motor dealer). When renewing your motor tax you need
Form RF100B (computerised reminder form). You can renew the motor tax on a
second-hand vehicle you have recently purchased, but you must be the registered
owner of the vehicle (see document on <a href="../buying_or_selling_a_vehicle/change_of_ownership.html">change of
vehicle ownership</a>).</p>

<p>You need your insurance details and a debit or credit card for paying the
tax. Only the following types of vehicles can be taxed online; private cars,
motorcycles, agricultural tractors, excavators/diggers, combine harvesters,
hearses, vehicles adapted for use by disabled persons, motor caravans (not for
first taxing) and vintage or veteran vehicles.</p>

<p>You can renew motor tax for a goods/commercial vehicle online providing you
have a certificate of roadworthiness which is valid from the beginning of the
new motor tax period. If the unladen weight does not exceed 1,524 kg (3,500 kg
Gross Vehicle Weight) you must have submitted goods declaration form RF111A to
your local motor tax office.</p>

<h3>Applying for a refund of motor tax</h3>

<p>To apply for a refund of motor tax, you need to <a href="https://www.motortax.ie/OMT/pdf/RF120_en.pdf">download and complete form
RF120 (pdf)</a>. Your completed application form should include the current tax
disc and the Vehicle Licensing/Registration Certificate or Registration Book.
If you are claiming a refund on the basis of an illness or injury, you should
include a medical certificate from your doctor or health professional. If you
are claiming a refund on the basis of an absence from the State for business or
educational purposes, you should have a letter from your employer or
educational facilitity as evidence of this. Your completed application form
should be returned to your Motor Tax Office who will process your
application.</p>

<p>It is a legal requirement to have motor insurance if you want to drive your
car in a public place and you must produce a current Certificate of Insurance
to pay <a shape="rect" href="motor_tax_rates.html">motor tax</a>. Failure to
have motor insurance when driving is a very serious offence and drivers will
incur fines, penalty points and may be disqualified from driving. (See 'Rules'
below).</p>

<p>Motor insurance is about protecting other road users as opposed to the
driver of the insured vehicle and it is not an optional extra. Insurance
companies provide motor insurance and unlike road tax, there is no such thing
as a "standard" rate. </p>

<p>Traditionally, gender has been one of the factors that insurance companies
consider when calculating risk. Arising from a ruling on a case brought before
the European Court of Justice, since 21 December 2012 insurance companies can
no longer quote a different price for motor insurance based on gender. Further
information on the <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/20121030%20ConsumerInfoNote_Unisex%20insurance.pdf/Files/20121030%20ConsumerInfoNote_Unisex%20insurance.pdf">introduction
of unisex insurance (pdf)</a> is available on the Department of Justice and
Equality's website. </p>

<p>Young drivers represent a high risk for insurers and the cost of motor
insurance in this age group is considerably higher than for others both in
Ireland and throughout the European Union (EU). </p>

<p>There are a number of things young drivers can do to reduce the cost of
motor insurance:</p>
<ul><li>Join a parent's insurance as a named driver as early as possible. This
    will enable you to establish a safety record, which is crucial when you
    want to apply for insurance in your own name. Some companies offer
    discounts to young people seeking insurance in their own name if they have
    been a named driver. </li>
  <li>Get a full licence as soon as possible. Having a full licence will reduce
    the cost of your insurance premium considerably. Savings vary, but it is
    possible for a young driver to save a vast amount on the cost of his or her
    insurance premium simply by having a full driving licence. </li>
  <li>Choose a car with a relatively small engine, as less powerful cars are
    cheaper to insure. </li>
  <li>Drive carefully. The best way to reduce the cost of your motor insurance
    is to build up your no claims bonus. </li>
</ul><h3>Motor insurance and the Equal Status Act</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0008/sec0005.html#partii-sec5">Section
5(2) of the Equal Status Act, 2000</a>, as amended, allows differential
treatment in relation to the calculation of insurance policies in Ireland. This
means, that insurance companies are allowed to charge higher or lower rates for
policies on the basis of your potential risk as a driver. Given that younger
drivers in Ireland are statistically more likely to have accidents, this
explains why there can be sizeable differences in insurance costs between
younger and older drivers. </p>

<h3>Types of motor insurance policy</h3>

<p>The most basic insurance is "third party" and this is the minimum required
by law. However, third party is only one of three main categories.</p>

<h3>Comprehensive</h3>

<p>This is the most expensive type of insurance on the market and covers you
for almost every eventuality: any damage done to the vehicle regardless of how
it was incurred; life/accident insurance; loss of personal belongings from the
car; the cost of a hired car if the insured car is off the road as a result of
an accident; windscreen breakage, etc. With more brand new cars on the road
than ever before, there has been a notable rise in people taking out
comprehensive insurance. A brand new car should be comprehensively insured. </p>

<h3>Third party, fire and theft</h3>

<p>This is the most popular form of motor insurance in Ireland. It covers you
for loss of the vehicle through fire or theft and for any loss as a result of
attempted fire or theft. Damage to property is also covered. There are also
optional extras available such as windscreen breakage.</p>

<h3>Third party</h3>

<p>This is the minimum cover required by law, but it does have restrictions and
limits, leaving you open to substantial loss in the event of an accident. If
you are at fault, then only your passengers and the driver and passengers of
the other vehicle will be compensated. This type of insurance provides no cover
for damage sustained in an accident to your car or if your car is stolen or
goes on fire. </p>

<p>An insurance company considers many things when calculating an insurance
premium. Most premiums are based on basic third party cover with the cost of
extras added on. The main thing that will determine the cost of your insurance
is what you actually want to be covered for. The following are always taken
into account: </p>

<h3>Licence</h3>

<p>Whether you are driving on a full or provisional licence makes a huge
difference to the cost of your motor insurance premium. You can expect to pay
hundreds of euro extra, if you only have a provisional licence. </p>

<h3>Size and age of car</h3>

<p>The engine capacity and age of the car play a large part in determining the
cost of your premium. The older the car, the more difficult it can be to
insure. Many insurance companies believe that the older a car is, the more
accident-prone it becomes. A new car is more expensive to replace than an old
car and will cost more to insure. Likewise, the more powerful the car you
drive, the more it will cost to insure.</p>

<h3>Age of the driver</h3>

<p>The young and the old represent high-risk categories and pay more for
insurance.</p>

<h3>Value of the car</h3>

<p>The value of a car is taken into account for third party, fire and theft and
for comprehensive insurance. What you have the car insured for, however, is not
always what the insurance company will pay out in the event of a claim. In the
event of the car being a write-off, the insurance company will only pay out
what it feels the car is worth, which, more often than not, is less than the
car is actually insured for. There is very little to gain by over-insuring a
car and, equally, you should not under-insure it either.</p>

<h3>Experience</h3>

<p>All insurance companies will ask if you have ever had insurance in your own
name before. If not, they will ask if you have ever driven under someone else's
insurance without incident. This will be taken into account when calculating a
premium. Insurance becomes less expensive with experience and a clean driving
record.</p>

<h3>Profession and use</h3>

<p>Some professions are considered to be more at risk than others and will have
a loading put onto their premium. What the car will actually be used for is
also taken into account. A standard policy covers the vehicle for social,
domestic and pleasure purposes, but not for the carriage of goods. If the car
is being used for business, then a loading will apply. If the car is being used
commercially, then an even higher loading will be imposed.</p>

<h3>Where the car is kept</h3>

<p>Those living in a major city, particularly Dublin, will normally have a
loading imposed. Some companies will also impose a loading if the car is not
kept in a garage at night.</p>

<h3>Excess and extras</h3>

<p>Most insurance policies contain some type of an excess clause. This means
that the policyholder is liable for an agreed amount towards the cost (e.g.,
the first 250 euro). The premium will cost more if this clause is taken out. It
pays to shop around, because what might be considered an extra in one company
(windscreen breakage, car hire in the event of the car being off the road, loss
of personal effects, etc.) could be standard in another.</p>

<h3>No claims discount</h3>

<p>A no claims discount (also known as no claims bonus) is built up over the
years and gives the policyholder a substantial reduction in the cost of his or
her premiums. The ceiling for a no claims bonus is usually around 60%, leaving
someone who has never had a claim with only 40% to pay. In the event of a minor
accident, it is sometimes cheaper to pay for any damage out of your own pocket
rather than claiming from your insurance and losing your no claims bonus. If
you make a claim and subsequently lose your no claims bonus, you can build it
up again in a few years. Some insurance companies will even allow you one claim
without it affecting your no claims bonus.</p>

<p>If you have no insurance in your own name for 2 or more years, many insurers
will not give you your no claims discount when you reapply for insurance
cover.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You must have motor insurance to drive a car in your own name or as a named
driver on someone else's policy. </p>

<p>Failure to have motor insurance or driving without insurance in Ireland is
generally punishable by:</p>
<ul><li>A fine of up to â‚¬5,000 </li>
  <li>5 penalty points and </li>
  <li>At the discretion of the court, a term of imprisonment not exceeding six
    months. </li>
</ul><p>The court may decide that you be disqualified from driving instead of
incurring penalty points. In that case, you will be disqualified for 2 years or
more for a first offence and 4 years or more in the case of a second offence
committed within 3 years of the first.</p>

<p>You should note that where a member of An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (Irish police
force) believes that a vehicle registered in Ireland (or outside Ireland) is
being used in a public place without insurance, the vehicle may be
impounded.</p>

<h3>If you are refused motor insurance</h3>

<p>Individual insurers <span>have the right</span> to refuse you cover, but
they <span>must provide you with a reason</span> for the refusal should you ask
for one. However, even though you have been refused cover, you are entitled to
go to the Declined Cases Committee of Insurance Ireland who will obtain an
insurance quotation for you. In order for the Committee to consider your case
you must first have sought and been refused quotations in writing from at least
three insurers. </p>

<p>With more companies than ever before competing for business, it is possible
to make considerable savings by ringing around for the best quote. Information
on the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nca.ie/nca/car-insurance">types of
motor insurance</a> there are, and the differences between them, is available
on the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission's website. It also
provides <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nca.ie/costcomparisons/cs_group_motor_insurance.htm">cost
comparison information</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You can apply for motor insurance over the phone, in person or through a

public telephone directory</a>. If you want to drive as a named driver on
someone else's policy, then that person must contact their insurance company
and arrange to have you insured under their policy.</p>

<h3>Renewing your motor insurance</h3>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/si/0074.html">Non-Life
Insurance (Provision of Information) (Renewal of Policy of Insurance)
Regulations 2007 (SI No. 74/2007)</a> your motor insurance company must issue
your insurance renewal notice not less than 15 working days before the date of
expiry of your insurance policy. It is also required to include with the notice
your no claims discount certificate. You will need this certificate if you want
to renew your motor insurance with a different insurance company.</p>

<p>An end-of-life vehicle (or ELV) is a car or light commercial vehicle with a
maximum mass not exceeding 3.5 tonnes which is to be disposed of by the
registered owner (in other words, a car or van which is to be scrapped). Owners
of intact end-of-life cars and vans must deposit such vehicles at an
appropriately permitted or licensed authorised treatment facility (ATF). An
authorised treatment facility may not charge for accepting an end-of-life
vehicle. When one of these vehicles is deposited at an authorised treatment
facility, the owner will receive a certificate of destruction. </p>

<p>The disposal of end-of-life vehicles is controlled because they can pose a
threat to the environment. This is largely because of the hazardous materials
contained in end-of-life vehicles. These include, for example, lead acid
batteries, fluids including lubricating oil, coolant, brake fluid, and
catalytic convertors, all of which must be disposed of safely in order to
prevent pollution. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1424268235079&amp;uri=URISERV:l21225">EU
Directive 2000/53/EC</a> (as amended) sets out specific measures to be put in
place by Member States concerning the collection, storage, treatment,
dismantling, reuse and recycling of end-of-life vehicles. The Directive is
given effect in Ireland through the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/si/0281.html">European Union
(End-of-Life Vehicles) Regulations 2014 (SI 281 of 2014)</a>.</p>

<h3>What exactly is an end-of-life vehicle? </h3>

<p>An end-of-life vehicle is a specified vehicle, such as a car, which is
discarded or is to be discarded by its registered owner as waste. Vehicles
normally reach the end of their useful lives, either due to age (typically
around 12-14 years), or because of heavy damage following an accident. There is
no fixed age, therefore, at which a vehicle can be considered an end-of-life
vehicle.</p>

<h3>Where can an end-of-life vehicle be deposited? </h3>

<p>An end-of-life vehicle must be deposited at an authorised treatment
facility. Each vehicle manufacturer or importer is required to have a national
collection system in place made up of at least one such treatment facility in
every city and council area. These facilities provide a free take-back service
for vehicles of that producer’s brand. There may also be an independent
facility in your area that will accept your end-of-life vehicle. </p>

<p>If an end-of-life vehicle is deposited at an unauthorised facility, the
owner will not receive a certificate of destruction and may remain recorded as
registered owner of the vehicle on the Department of Transport, Tourism and
Sport’s National Vehicle File.</p>

<h3>Will the authorised treatment facility collect the vehicle if the
registered owner is unable to transport it to the facility?</h3>

<p>This is a matter for the owner of the vehicle. An authorised treatment
facility that forms part of a producers network is bound to accept any
specified vehicle of that producer’s brand and may not charge. An independent
authorised treatment facility may refuse to accept any vehicle but if it is
accepted, no charge can be made. In both cases this is subject to the vehicle
being largely intact. If the vehicle has to be transported to the treatment
facility (for example by tow truck), it is the responsibility of the owner to
meet this cost.</p>

<h3>What services is an authorised treatment facility obliged to provide?</h3>

<p>An operator of an authorised end-of-life vehicle treatment facility is
obliged to:</p>
<ul><li>Issue the registered owner with a certificate of destruction </li>
  <li>Ensure the facility is operated under an appropriate waste licence or
    permit </li>
  <li>Meet the minimum technical requirements for the storage, treatment and
    recovery of end-of-life vehicles and the storage of components containing
    fluids, spare parts, etc. </li>
  <li>Keep records of end-of-life vehicle materials for reuse, recycling,
    recovery and disposal and report these records to local authorities
    annually. </li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You cannot be charged for depositing an end-of-life vehicle at an authorised
treatment facility, if you are the registered owner of that vehicle and the
vehicle is intact. You must bring the vehicle registration documents with you.
</p>

<p>If essential parts of the vehicle (for example, engine, gearbox,
transmission and catalytic converter) are missing, or the vehicle contains
waste, then you can be charged. A good rule of thumb is, if you want the car
accepted for free, don’t harvest spare parts of value first.</p>

<p>When you have deposited your vehicle at an authorised treatment facility,
the owner or operator of the facility will: </p>
<ul><li>Issue you (if you are the registered owner) with a certificate of
    destruction </li>
  <li>Forward the details of the certificate of destruction to the National
    Vehicle and Driver File, maintained by the Department of Transport, Tourism
    and Sport </li>
</ul><p>The vehicle must be treated within 10 days of being deposited at the
facility. </p>

<h3>Offences concerning the disposal of end-of-life vehicles</h3>

<p>It is an offence for you (or an authorised treatment facility) to fail to
comply with the law on the disposal of end-of-life vehicles. In particular, it
is an offence not to obey the rules concerning vehicle certificates of
destruction or not to deposit at an authorised treatment facility a vehicle you
intend to discard as waste.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/29/section/35/enacted/en/html#sec35">Environment
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015</a> introduced fixed payment notices (on
the spot fines) for certain offences. Owners who fail to deposit an end of life
vehicle at an authorised treatment facility can be issued a fine of €100.
Certain other offences regarding certificates of destruction and obligations on
Authorised Treatment Facilities can result in a fine of €1000.</p>

<p>Other penalties for offences are set out in Regulation 35 of the
Regulations. On summary conviction a <a href="../../../justice/criminal_law/criminal_trial/maximum_fines_on_summary_conviction.html">class
A fine</a> and/or 12 months imprisonment can be imposed. For conviction on
indictment a fine of up to €500,000 and/or 3 years imprisonment is available
to the court. </p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>You will not be charged if you deposit an intact end-of-life vehicle at an
authorised treatment facility, provided you are the registered owner of that
vehicle. </p>

<p>You may be charged for depositing the vehicle, if essential components of
the vehicle are missing. </p>

<p>You may be able to <a shape="rect" href="../motor_tax_and_insurance/motor_tax_rates.html">claim a refund of motor
tax</a> if there is more than 3 months unexpired tax.</p>

<p>You must bring your vehicle, along with the vehicle's registration document,

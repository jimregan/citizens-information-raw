<p>If you sell your vehicle or trade it in for a new model, you must register
the change of ownership. This is done in one of two ways and depends on whether
the vehicle was first registered before or after January 1993. </p>

<p>You register a change of ownership at your local Motor Taxation Office if
your vehicle was first registered before 1 January 1993. If it was first
registered after this date, the change of ownership must be registered directly
with the Driver and Vehicle Computer Services Division of the Department of
Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p>

<p>Where your vehicle was first registered after April 2004 a new form of
Vehicle Registration Certificate would have been issued. This replaced both the
Vehicle Registration Certificate and the Vehicle Licensing Certificate issued
for cars registered before April 2004.</p>

<h3>Vehicles registered before January 1993</h3>

<p>Information on change of ownership for pre-1993 vehicles is available on the
<a href="http://www.dttas.ie/roads/english/motor-taxvehicle-registraton-nvdf#lnk_2">Department
of Transport, Tourism and Sport website</a>.</p>

<h3>Selling a vehicle registered after 1 January 1993</h3>

<p>If you sell a pre-April 2004 vehicle privately, part B of the Vehicle
Licensing Certificate, which you would have received when you bought the
vehicle, should be completed and returned to the Driver and Vehicle Computer
Services Division of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. The new
details will be registered and the certificate will be sent to the new owner.
The Vehicle Registration Certificate, which you also get when you buy a
pre-April 2004 vehicle, should be given to the new owner at the time of the
sale.</p>

<p>If you sell a post-April 2004 vehicle privately, part B of the Vehicle
Registration Certificate which you would have received when you bought the
vehicle, should be completed and returned to the Driver and Vehicle Computer
Services Division. The new details will be registered and the certificate will
be sent to the new owner. </p>

<p>If you sell your vehicle to a motor dealer, you have to complete <a shape="rect" href="https://www.motortax.ie/OMT/pdf/RF105_en.pdf">Form RF105
(pdf)</a> which is available from the motor dealer. The completed form should
be returned to the Driver and Vehicle Computer Services Division, while the
Vehicle Licensing Certificate and Vehicle Registration Certificates (Vehicle
Registration Certificate for post-April 2004 vehicles) are given to the motor
dealer.</p>

<p>When selling a vehicle to a motor dealer in either transaction, a valid
garage code must be supplied on behalf of the motor dealer. Failure to supply
this code will result in the change of ownership being rejected - by either
your Motor Tax Office or the Driver and Vehicle Computer Services Division. The
motor dealer can only obtain a valid garage code from the Department in Co.
Clare by fulfilling strict criteria. (See "Where to apply" for contact
information.</p>

<h4>Exporting your vehicle</h4>

<p>If you are selling your vehicle to a person resident outside the State, you
must send the Vehicle Registration Certificate and the purchaser’s name and
address details to the Driver and Vehicle Computer Services Division. They will
assist the authorities in the purchaser’s state with vehicle details.</p>

<p>The record of your vehicle on the National Vehicle and Driver File will
continue to be recorded in your name until confirmation is received from the
authorities in the purchaser’s state that the car has been imported into that
country and registered there.</p>

<h3>Buying a vehicle registered after 1 January 1993</h3>

<p>If you privately buy a vehicle that was first registered after this date,
the seller must fill in your details on part B of the Vehicle Licensing
Certificate (Vehicle Registration Certificate for post-April 2004 vehicles) and
return it to the Driver and Vehicle Computer Services Division. The new details
will be registered and the amended certificate will be sent to you. The seller
will give the Vehicle Registration Certificate for a pre-April 2004 vehicle to
you when you buy the vehicle. </p>

<h3>Deceased owner</h3>

<p>If you buy a vehicle and the current owner (seller) is deceased, a letter
from the executor of the deceased's will, or the solicitor dealing with the
will, indicating your right to the vehicle should accompany the Vehicle
Registration Certificate (VRC). Where the VRC is not available or cannot be
produced, an administrative process allows the acceptance of a declaration of
ownership change in the form of a statutory declaration sworn before a
Commissioner for Oaths or a practising solicitor. The statutory declaration
form, which is available from the Driver and Vehicle Computer Services
Division, should accompany the letter from the executor of the will or the
solicitor mentioned above.</p>

<h3>Motor tax</h3>

<p>You cannot tax your vehicle until the registration of the change of
ownership has gone through. You can <a href="https://www.motortax.ie/PSE/start.do?page=welcome">check the status of
the vehicle</a> on motortax.ie. You can then renew the motor tax on the vehicle
using Form RF100A or online. If the motor tax has already expired, you are not
liable for the arrears period from the expiry of the last tax disc to the end
of the month immediately preceding the date of sale.See <a href="../motor_tax_and_insurance/motor_tax_rates.html">document on motor
tax</a>.</p>

<h3>Replacing lost/misplaced documents</h3>

vehicle ownership. List of documents and the cost of their replacement is as

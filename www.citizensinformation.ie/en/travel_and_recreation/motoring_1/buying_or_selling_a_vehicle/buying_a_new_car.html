<p>Generally, all new cars and cars that are imported into Ireland are subject
to Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) and must be registered with Revenue. Before
you can drive your car in a public place you must also:</p>
<ul><li>Have vehicle registration plates</li>
  <li>Have motor insurance</li>
  <li>Have paid motor tax</li>
</ul><p>This document explains what is involved in buying a new car in Ireland from
a dealer or a garage. In other documents you will find information on:</p>

<h3>Vehicle labelling</h3>

<p>Since July 2008, a labelling system allows consumers to compare the carbon
(CO2) emissions of new cars. The first section of the label shows the emission
bands and identifies the band for the particular vehicle to which a label is
attached. The second section of the label provides three important points of
information for consumers:</p>
<ul><li>The amount of fuel required to run the vehicle over 18,000 kilometres</li>
  <li>The annual motor tax payable</li>
  <li>The rate of VRT payable on the vehicle</li>
</ul><p>The third section of the label supplements the information provided in the
first and second sections, and introduces the importance of driving behaviour.
The remaining sections of the label provide essential information on the actual
vehicle to which it is attached, including make, model, engine capacity,
transmission, fuel type and consumption. An <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Environment/Atmosphere/FileDownLoad,17584,en.pdf">example
of a label is available here (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Buying from a car dealer</h3>

<p>When you buy your new car from a dealer (for example, car showrooms), it is
the dealer's responsibility to register the vehicle and pay the required tax
before giving it to you.</p>

<p>Every new car is liable for Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT), which is payable
when the car is first registered. The price of the vehicle should include the
cost of VRT. There is more information on VRT in our <a href="../../../moving_country/moving_to_ireland/coming_to_live_in_ireland/importing_car_into_ireland.html">document
on importing a car</a>.</p>

<p>Once the vehicle has been registered and the VRT paid, your car dealer will
receive:</p>
<ul><li>A receipt for the VRT paid showing the registration number assigned to
    your car</li>
  <li>A Form RF 100 for use when you are applying for motor tax (see below)</li>
</ul><h3>Vehicle registration plates</h3>

<p><a href="../../vehicle_standards/vehicle_registration_numbers.html">Vehicle
registration plates</a> showing the assigned registration number must be
displayed on your car within 3 days of the date of registration. The dealer
should have the registration plates fitted by the time you take possession of
it.</p>

<h3>Vehicle registration certificate</h3>

<p>The vehicle registration certificate for your car is issued by the
Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. This will be posted out to you
after you have applied to your local motor tax office to pay motor tax on your
vehicle.</p>

<h3>Motor insurance</h3>

<p>It is a legal requirement to have motor insurance and to display the
insurance disc on the windscreen, if you want to drive your car in a public
place. You will need your motor insurance details when applying for motor tax.
Read more about the <a href="../motor_tax_and_insurance/motor_insurance.html">requirement for motor
insurance here</a>.</p>

<h3>Motor tax</h3>

<p>Motor tax is a charge imposed by the Government on motor vehicles. Not only
must you pay motor tax if you want to drive your car in a public place, but you
are also required to display evidence that you have paid (that is, a current
tax disc) on the windscreen.</p>

<p>The charge for motor tax for a new car is based on the car's CO2 emissions
and on engine size for other vehicles. Some vehicles are exempt. Read more
about the <a href="../motor_tax_and_insurance/motor_tax_rates.html">requirement for motor
tax here</a>.</p>

<h3>Tax reliefs and exemptions</h3>

<p>There are different reliefs and exemptions from VRT and further information
is available on <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/reliefs-exemptions.html">Revenue’s
website</a>. Tax relief is also available under the <a href="../../transport_and_disability/tax_relief_for_disabled_drivers_and_disabled_passengers.html">Disabled
Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme</a>.</p>

<h3>Electric vehicles grant scheme</h3>

<p>A grant scheme is available for battery-powered electric vehicles (BEV) and
plug-in hybrids meeting specific standards. The grant level applicable depends
on the List Price of the vehicle. The maximum grant is €5,000. There is no
grant for vehicles with a List Price of less than €14,000.</p>

<p>The grant is provided to the dealer and the benefit is passed on to you as a
price reduction on the vehicle. Further information on the grant scheme is
available on the <a href="http://www.seai.ie/Grants/Electric_Vehicle_Grant_Scheme/">website of the
Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI)</a>.</p>

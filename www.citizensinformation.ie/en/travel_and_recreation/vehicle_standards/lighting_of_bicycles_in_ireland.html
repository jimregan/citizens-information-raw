<p>If you wish to use a bicycle on a public road in Ireland, your bicycle must
be fitted with certain reflectors and lamps to ensure that other road users
will see you. All bicycles used on public roads are required to comply with the
<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1963/en/si/0189.html">Road Traffic
(Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations 1963</a> as amended. This law sets down the
type of reflectors and lamps that your bicycle must be fitted with and when you
must use your bicycle lamps. Every year in Ireland, many cyclists are hurt,
seriously injured or killed as a result of improper lighting on their bicycles.
</p>

<h3>Rights to demand name and address of cyclists</h3>

<p>Under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1961/en/act/pub/0024/sec0108.html#zza24y1961s108">Section
108 of the Road Traffic Act 1961</a> as amended, a member of An Garda
Síochána (Irish police force) may demand your name, address and date of birth
if they suspect you have committed any crime or offence. They may also demand
your name, address and date of birth if they suspect you have been involved in
a collision or caused injury to property or someone else. If you fail to give
your name, address or date of birth, or give a false name, address or date of
birth, the Garda may retain your bicycle until they are satisfied as to your
identity.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>All bicycles used on public roads in Ireland must at all times display a
rear reflector. A rear reflector means a red reflector that can be plainly seen
for a distance of 99 meters (325 feet) to the rear when the headlights of a
vehicle shine directly on it. <span>The only exception to this rule is on a
child's bicycle where that bicycle is used during the daytime</span>. </p>

<p>During "lighting-up time", that is, the period beginning half an hour after
sunset and ending half an hour before sunrise on the following morning, all
cyclists are required to have fitted (and make use of) the following lighting
on their bicycles: </p>
<ul><li>One front lamp </li>
  <li>One rear lamp </li>
</ul><p>A front lamp means a lamp that is fitted to a non-mechanically propelled
vehicle showing to the front a white or yellow light that is visible for a
reasonable distance. </p>

<p>A rear lamp is a lamp that is fitted to the rear of your bicycle and when it
is lit, showing a red light that is visible for a reasonable distance.</p>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/si/0487.html">SI 487
of 2009</a>, since 14 December 2009 it is legal to use flashing front and rear
lamps. </p>

<p>Lamps do not need to be lit when stopped in traffic or when a person wheels
the bicycle on foot as near as is possible to the left-hand edge of the road.
</p>

<p>Failure to use proper lighting on a bicycle is an offence. If you are
stopped by a member of the Gardai, the Garda may take your name and address,
details about your bicycle and the time and date of the offence. You may be
given a caution or you may be issued with a summons to appear in court. </p>

<p>Most bicycles sold in shops today are already fitted with appropriate
reflectors as standard. You can purchase bicycle lamps and/or reflectors at any
reputable bicycle shop. </p>

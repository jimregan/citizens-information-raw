<p>There are strict rules in place regarding the format, dimensions and
technical specifications of vehicle registration plates that are displayed on
vehicles in Ireland. Registration numbers are automatically assigned in
sequence at the time when you register your vehicle. Failure to have a vehicle
licence plate that conforms to the standards will result in a fine.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The exact rules regarding the special format of vehicle registration plates
are set down in Irish law under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/si/0318.html">(SI 318/92 Vehicle
Registration and Taxation Regulations 1992</a> as amended. This law outlines
the format, dimensions and technical specifications that must be displayed on
registered vehicles in Ireland. </p>

<p>The main requirements of the rules about the format of vehicle registration
plates are: </p>
<ul><li>The registration number consisting of numbers and letters must be in
    black on a white reflective background </li>
  <li>The name of the county of registration must be in Irish, (examples are
    Baile Átha Cliath, Corcaigh, etc.) </li>
  <li>The flag of the EU and the letters "IRL" must be placed on the left-hand
    side of the plate, the flag comprising 12 gold stars in a circle, the
    letters in white beneath it, all on a blue reflective background. No other
    numbers, letters, marks, etc., should appear on your registration plate.
  </li>
</ul><p>Since January 2013 each year has two registration periods. The sequence
takes the form of a separate 3-digit year identifier for the first and second
6-month periods of the year, for example, 151 and 152 respectively.</p>

<p>You can view <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/leaflets/format-vehicle-registration-plates.html">images
of acceptable vehicle registration plates here</a>.</p>

<p>Vehicle registration plates must be affixed to the front and back of your
vehicle and clearly visible at all times. In situations where you are towing a
trailer, caravan, etc., a duplicate of the registration plate must be affixed
to the back of the trailer, caravan, etc. </p>

<p>Vehicles with only 1 front wheel (i.e., motorcycles) are <span>only
required</span> to carry the registration plate on the back of the vehicle. </p>

<h3>Reserving a vehicle registration number</h3>

<p>You can only apply to reserve a vehicle registration number plate on or
after the 1st November of the year before you intend to bring the vehicle into
use. In other words, you can only apply to reserve a vehicle registration
number plate on or after 1 November 2015 to use this plate in 2016. </p>

<p>The number you reserve must be in the normal format and must correspond with
the licensing authority area where you normally reside, and the year and half
year in which the vehicle is to be first brought into use, i.e., 162-D-111 may
only be reserved by someone living in Dublin for a vehicle intended to be
brought into use in the second half of 2016. </p>

<p>The registered owner of the vehicle on which the plates are to be displayed
must be the person in whose name the number was reserved. You cannot transfer a
reserved number. </p>

<p>All registration numbers are available for reservation with the exception of
the first number of each half year issued in the following cities - Cork,
Dublin, Limerick and Waterford. These registration plates are, for example,
161-C-1, 162-C-1, 161-D-1, 162-D-1, 161-L-1, 162-L-1, 161-W-1 and 162-W-1.
These plates are reserved for the Mayor/Lord Mayor of each of these cities and
are not available for reservation by anyone else. </p>

<p>A reserved registration number can only be assigned to a vehicle when it has
been reached in the normal sequence. It may not be displayed on a vehicle
before it has been formally assigned by the Revenue Commissioners following the
presentation and acceptance of a completed declaration for registration. </p>

<p>Applications will be processed on receipt on the first working day of
November. </p>

<p>No priority will be given to applications received before this date. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The fee to reserve a vehicle registration number is €1,000. </p>

<p>There is no fee for registration numbers issued in the normal way, apart
from the cost of the number plate.</p>

<p>Fines of up to €5,000 may be imposed by the Revenue Commissioners for
registration plates that fail to comply with the law.</p>

<p>Compulsory car testing was introduced in Ireland in January 2000 as part of
an EU Directive that makes car testing compulsory in all member states. It is
an offence to drive a car that is liable for testing without displaying a
National Car Testing Service disc and offenders will face <a href="../../justice/criminal_law/criminal_trial/maximum_fines_on_summary_conviction.html">Class
C fines</a>, as well as <a shape="rect" href="../motoring_1/driving_offences/penalty_points_for_driving_offences.html">penalty
points</a>. </p>

<p>The test is called the National Car Test and is carried out on behalf of the
Government by the National Car Testing Service Ltd (<acronym title="National Car Testing Service">NCTS</acronym>). The test is aimed at
improving road safety and enhancing environmental protection. You can <a shape="rect" href="https://www.ncts.ie/1127">view NCT pass/fail rates
here</a>.</p>

<h3>Format of the National Car Test</h3>

<p>The central testing operation is based in Citywest Business Campus, outside
Dublin, with a <a shape="rect" href="https://www.ncts.ie/1106">network of
operating centres nationwide</a>. The testing procedure is computer controlled
and highly automated and provides maximum test security and accuracy. </p>

<p>The test cover among other things: brakes; exhaust emission; wheels and
tyres; lights; steering and suspension; chassis and underbody; electrical
systems; glass and mirrors; transmission; interior and fuel system. </p>

<p>Minor things such as broken windscreen wipers, wing mirrors or indicators
will fail you just as easily as high emission levels, faulty steering or bad
brakes. The single largest categories for car failures are problems with
headlights, emissions and brakes. A pass certificate or a failure report is
issued after the test and if the car fails, the report explains why and what
needs to be done.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ncts.ie/media/1004/nct-manual-july-2014.pdf">National Car
Test (NCT) Manual (pdf)</a> is available on the NCT website</p>

<p>The NCTS recommends that you prepare for the test by ensuring that:</p>
<ul><li>Your car has adequate oil and water </li>
  <li>The boot is empty and seats are clear of personal belongings such as
    removable baby seats </li>
  <li>The vehicle is reasonably clean (especially the underbody) </li>
  <li>The wheel hubcaps are removed and the tyres are inflated to the correct
    pressure </li>
  <li>Seat belts and clips are fully visible </li>
  <li>Your <a shape="rect" href="vehicle_registration_numbers.html">vehicle
    registration plates</a> comply with current regulations </li>
  <li>The timing belt has been replaced in the case of a diesel vehicle, i.e.,
    within the timeframe specified by the vehicle manufacturer </li>
  <li>NCT recommend you have your lights checked and set prior to the test.
  </li>
</ul><p>If you do get your car serviced, the NCTS advises that special attention is
paid to the most common failure points:</p>
<ul><li>Headlights: alignment and condition </li>
  <li>Brakes: front, rear and hand brake </li>
  <li>Exhaust emissions: in most cases a slight tuning of the engine is
    sufficient. </li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Since 2000 onwards, all cars 4 years and over are tested. Vehicles that pass
the test will have to undergo repeat tests every 2 years. Since June 2011, cars
over 10 years old are tested each year. </p>

<p>Since 28 July 2014, you can <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Your-Vehicle/Your-Vehicle-/NCT/Voluntary-Early-Testing/">submit
your vehicle voluntarily</a> for the test any time before the test due date and
receive an NCT certificate which is valid for 1 or 2 years (depending on the
age of the car) from the date of the test.</p>

<p>You <span>must bring your vehicle registration/licensing certificate</span>
with you to the test centre. You are also required to produce your driving
licence or passport as identification.</p>

<h3>Exemptions from NCT</h3>

<p>Vehicles registered before 1 January 1980 are not required to be tested.</p>

<p>Cars permanently based on islands that are not connected to the mainland by
road do not have to be tested.</p>

<h3>Car-vans </h3>

<p>In the case of car-vans that have their rear side-windows blocked off, you
should contact the Road Safety Authority (Tel: 091 872 600) for further
information.</p>

<h3>Vehicles imported from Northern Ireland and abroad</h3>

<p>Vehicles imported to Ireland from outside the State (including Northern
Ireland) must also go through the NCT once the vehicle is 4 years old or more.
This applies <span>even if the vehicle previously received an MOT</span> or any
other vehicle test abroad. If the imported vehicle is already 4 years old or
more when imported, it must go through the NCT immediately. For more
information about the NCT and imported cars contact the NCT Customer Services
Department on 1890 200 670.</p>

<h3>Appealing NCT results</h3>

<p>If you are dissatisfied with the test result you may appeal it through the
NCTS appeal process. In the first instance you should raise your concerns with
the person in charge of the Test Centre before leaving. <a href="https://www.ncts.ie/1172">Information on making a complaint or an

<p>If you wish to ride a motorcycle on a public road in Ireland, you should be
aware there are specific rules in place about the type of lamps and reflectors
that must be fitted to your motorcycle. These provisions are set down in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1963/en/si/0189.html">Road
Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963</a> (as amended). Effective
use of lighting on your motorcycle will ensure that other road users see you.
The Gardai (Irish police force) are responsible for the enforcement of the law
on the lighting of vehicles in Ireland and this enforcement is essential for
road safety. The object of these Regulations is to prevent accidents and
protect life and property. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Motorcycles at all times are required to have: </p>
<ul><li>One head lamp: this is a lamp that when lit, adequately lights the road
    ahead with a white or yellow light for a distance of 99 metres (325 feet)
    (or 30.5 metres (100 feet) when dipped) and in the case of a low-powered
    motorcycle, a reasonable distance. </li>
  <li>One rear lamp: this is a lamp fitted to the rear and when lit, a red
    light is visible for 152 metres (500 feet). </li>
  <li>One rear reflector: this is a red reflector that can be plainly seen for
    a distance of 99 metres (325 feet) to the rear when the headlights of a
    vehicle shine directly on it. </li>
  <li>Identification mark lighting: this is a white light illuminating the rear
    identification plate so that each letter and number is easily
    distinguishable for a distance of 20 metres (65 feet) to the rear. </li>
  <li>Position lamp (if not fitted with a head lamp or if a side car is
    attached): this is a lamp not exceeding 7 watts that is fitted not more
    than 1.5 metres (5 feet) from the ground and which when lit shows to the
    front a white light visible for 152 metres (500 feet). </li>
  <li>Direction indicators and high mounted stop lamp <span>(this is
    optional)</span>: A direction indicator is a device fitted to a motorcycle
    that is capable of indicating to the other road users that the driver
    intends to turn right or left. Indicators must be either semaphore or
    flashing. </li>
</ul><p>Side-cars of motorcycles are required at all times to have: </p>
<ul><li>One position lamp </li>
  <li>One rear lamp (as above) </li>
  <li>One rear reflector </li>
</ul><h3>Use of head lamps</h3>

<p>The head lamps on your motorcycle should be dipped in good time in the
following situations: </p>
<ul><li>Meeting oncoming vehicles (i.e., vehicles coming towards you from the
    opposite direction) </li>
  <li>In built-up areas where public lighting is provided, and special speed
    limit areas </li>
  <li>In periods of poor visibility (i.e., heavy fog, snow, rain, dust) </li>
  <li>Travelling behind another vehicle </li>
  <li>When failing to use your head lamps may cause inconvenience to other road
    users. </li>
</ul><h3>Lighting-up hours</h3>

<p>All motorcyclists are required to use lamps (other than stop lamps) during
"lighting-up" hours. If you are using your motorcycle during the day when
visibility is poor, you are also required to use lamps. If you are using lamps
on your motorcycle, you should ensure that your lights are dipped when
approaching other road users. </p>

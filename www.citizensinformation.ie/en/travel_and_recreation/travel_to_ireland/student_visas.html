<h3>Travelling to Ireland for study</h3>

<p>Citizens of certain countries who wish to pursue a course of study in
Ireland must apply for a visa to enter Ireland before they travel here.
Information on those who need an entry visa is available in our document: <a href="../../moving_country/moving_to_ireland/coming_to_live_in_ireland/visa_requirements_for_entering_ireland.html">Visa
requirements for entering Ireland</a>. </p>

<p>If you are a non-EEA national coming to study in Ireland you must be
enrolled in a full-time course on the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Interim%20List%20of%20Eligible%20Programmes%20-%20ILEP">Interim
List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP)</a>. You can find out more in our document
on <a href="../../moving_country/moving_to_ireland/studying_in_ireland/immigration_nonEEA_students.html">the
immigration rules for non-EEA students</a>. </p>

<p>Visa applicants must apply online for their visa - see 'How to apply'. If
you wish to study in Ireland for less than 3 months you should apply for a 'C
study visa'. If your course lasts longer than 3 months, you should apply for a
'D study visa'. </p>

<p>You will need to provide the following with your visa application. (Please
remember, <strong>original documents</strong> are required and <strong>must be
in English</strong> or accompanied by a notarised translation):</p>
<ul><li>Letter of acceptance from a recognised school/college/university in
    Ireland confirming that you have been accepted on a course of study. This
    course of study must be full-time (lasting an academic year) and have a
    minimum of 15 hours per week study time. </li>
  <li>Evidence of your academic ability to pursue the chosen course through the
    English language (unless it is an English language course). </li>
  <li>Evidence that the fees for the course have been paid in full. </li>
  <li>Evidence that you have enough funds (€7,000) to maintain yourself for
    the initial part of your stay.</li>
  <li>Evidence that you or a sponsor have access to <strong>at least €7,000
    for each subsequent year </strong>of your studies, in addition to the
    course fees for each of those years.</li>
  <li>Evidence that you have private medical insurance </li>
  <li>An explanation of any gaps in your educational history </li>
  <li>Confirmation that you intend to return to your country of permanent
    residence when you leave Ireland. </li>
</ul><p>Remember, the granting of a student visa to study in Ireland <strong>does
not confer</strong> the automatic right of anyone to join or visit you in
Ireland (whether they are a relative or not). </p>

<p>You will find more detailed <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Study">information on the exact
requirements for a student visa</a> on the website of the Irish Naturalisation
and Immigration Service of the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>

<h3>If I don't need an entry visa to enter Ireland, do I need a student visa to
study?</h3>

<p>No. If you do not require an entry visa to enter Ireland, you do not require
a student visa to study in Ireland. However, all non-EEA nationals, including
those with visas, must obtain permission to enter the State by reporting to an
Immigration Officer at the port of entry. (The members of the EEA are the 28
countries of the European Union (EU), together with Iceland, Norway and
Liechtenstein) </p>

<p>You should have all documentation relating to your studies on your person
when coming through immigration. In other words, you should have your letter of
offer of a place at the school, or educational institution ready for inspection
at immigration. You can read more in our document on <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/coming_to_live_in_ireland/permission_to_land_in_ireland.html">permission
to land in Ireland</a>.</p>

<h3>Permission to remain</h3>

<p>Students from a non-EEA country who intend studying in Ireland for a period
of more than 3 months must register, after they arrive, with the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/registration-offices">local
immigration officer</a> for the district in which they are living (<a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/contact-registration">Burgh Quay
Registration Office</a> if living in Dublin). Their passport will be endorsed
with the conditions and period of time for which they have permission to
remain. <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Notice%20Regarding%20Evidence%20of%20Finances%20for%20all%20Non%20EEA%20Students">Students
who do not require a visa must have <strong>€3,000</strong></a> when they
first register. Information on what documentation students require when
applying for permission is available on the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Students">website of the Irish
Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS).</a> </p>

<p>Non-EEA students coming to Ireland for the first time may not get permission
to remain in Ireland if they have their children with them, or intend their
children to join them later on. There is more <a shape="rect" href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Transitional%20Arrangements%20regarding%20the%20placement%20in%20schools%20of%20non-EEA%20Children%20not%20accompanied%20by%20parents%20and%20of%20children%20.pdf/Files/Transitional%20Arrangements%20regarding%20the%20placement%20in%20schools%20of%20non-EEA%20Children%20not%20accompanied%20by%20parents%20and%20of%20children%20.pdf">information
about the children of non-EEA students on the INIS website (pdf)</a>. </p>

<p>You can find out how to register in our document on <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/rights_of_residence_in_ireland/registration_of_non_eea_nationals_in_ireland.html">Registration
of non-EEA nationals in Ireland</a>.</p>

<h3>Access to employment while in Ireland on a student visa</h3>

<p>If you are attending a course on the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Interim%20List%20of%20Eligible%20Programmes%20-%20ILEP">Interim
List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP)</a> you will have <em>stamp number 2</em>
endorsed on your passport when you register with your local immigration
officer. You will be allowed to take up <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Changes%20to%20the%20Employment%20entitlements%20of%20Non-EEA%20Students%20holding%20Immigration%20Stamp%202%20%E2%80%93%20with%20effect%20from%201%20September%202016">casual
employment</a> of up to 20 hours part-time work per week in term time or up to
40 hours per week during college vacation periods, that is, from June to
September inclusive and from 15 December to 15 January. Your entitlement to
take up employment ceases when your permission to remain expires.</p>

<p>If you are not attending such a course, you will not be entitled to take up
part-time work or engage in any business or profession. You will get <em>stamp
number 2A</em> on your passport. </p>

<p>You can read information on <a shape="rect" href="../../../employment/types_of_employment/part_time_employment/employment_rights_of_part_time_workers.html">employment
rights of part-time workers in Ireland here</a>.</p>

<h3>What do I do if I want to leave for a short while?</h3>

<p>The visa issued to you allows you to enter the State once. If you wish to
leave for a short while and then return you must apply for a re-entry visa.
(See 'How to apply' below for information on how to apply for a re-entry
visa.)</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to ensure you have the correct visa (if required)
for the country you intend travelling to. Please note that you must obtain a
visa from the UK authorities before travelling to Northern Ireland (Counties
Antrim, Armagh, Derry, Down, Fermanagh and Tyrone). Information on applying for
a visa to visit the UK is available from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-ukvi-outside-uk">UK Visas and
Immigration</a>.</p>

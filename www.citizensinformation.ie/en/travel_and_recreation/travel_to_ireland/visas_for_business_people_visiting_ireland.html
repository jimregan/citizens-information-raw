<h3>Travelling to Ireland on business</h3>

<p>Citizens of certain countries must apply for a visa to enter Ireland before
they travel here on business trips. Information on those who need an entry visa
is available in our document: <a href="../../moving_country/moving_to_ireland/coming_to_live_in_ireland/visa_requirements_for_entering_ireland.html">Visa
requirements for entering Ireland</a>. </p>

<p>Citizens of EU/EEA member states or Switzerland do not require a visa to
travel to Ireland on business. (The members of the EEA are the 28 countries of
the European Union (EU), together with Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein).
There is <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Family%20Members%20of%20EU_EEA%20_Swiss%20citizens">information
for non-EEA nationals applying for a short-stay visa to accompany or join an EU
citizen family member</a> in Ireland on the Irish Naturalisation &amp;
Immigration Service (INIS) website.</p>

<p>Even if you do not require a visa to enter Ireland, all non-EEA nationals
must obtain <a href="../../moving_country/moving_to_ireland/coming_to_live_in_ireland/permission_to_land_in_ireland.html">permission
to enter the State</a> by reporting to an Immigration Officer at the port of
entry. You should have supporting documentation relating to the purpose of your
visit (see below).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Irish%20Short%20Stay%20Visa%20Waiver%20Programme">Short
Stay Visa Waiver Programme</a> allows nationals of a number of Eastern
European, Middle East and Asian countries who have a short-term UK visa to come
to Ireland without the need for a separate Irish visa. This programme has been
extended to 31 October 2021.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/British%20Irish%20Visa%20Scheme">British
Irish Visa Scheme</a> applies to visitors from China since 20 October 2014 and
to visitors from India since 9 February 2015. This scheme allows visitors from
these countries to travel freely within the Common Travel Area (in this case,
Ireland and the UK but not the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man), using
either an Irish or UK visa.</p>

<h3>Documentation required</h3>

<p>If you are coming to Ireland for a business meeting and you require a visa,
you must present the following with your visa application. </p>
<ul><li>A letter of invitation from the Irish company in question, outlining what
    you will be doing on your proposed stay in Ireland and how long you will be
    staying </li>
  <li>Confirmation of where you will be staying during your proposed stay in
    Ireland </li>
  <li>Confirmation of who will be responsible for your expenses during your
    stay in Ireland. (Irrespective of whether it is you or your company,
    evidence may be required) </li>
</ul><p>There is more information on the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Business%20Visa">documentation
required for a business visa</a> on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and
Immigration Service of the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>

<p>If you are coming to Ireland for a conference and you require a visa, you
must present the following with your visa application:</p>
<ul><li>A letter from the conference host outlining the nature and duration of
    your proposed stay in Ireland </li>
  <li>Confirmation of where you will be staying during your proposed stay in
    Ireland </li>
  <li>Confirmation of who will be responsible for your expenses during your
    stay in Ireland. If it is you or your company, evidence may be required
  </li>
</ul><p>The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service has more information on the
<a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Conference%20or%20Event%20Visa">documentation
required for a conference visa.</a></p>

<h3>Permission to land</h3>

<p>All non-EEA nationals, including those with visas, must obtain permission to
enter the State by reporting to an Immigration Officer at the port of entry.
You should have supporting documentation relating to the purpose of your visit
on your person when coming through immigration. You can read more in our
document on <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/coming_to_live_in_ireland/permission_to_land_in_ireland.html">permission
to land in Ireland</a>. </p>

<h3>What do I do if I want to leave for a short while?</h3>

<p>The visa issued to you allows you to enter the State once. If you wish to
leave for a short while and then return you must apply for a re-entry visa.
(See 'How to apply' below for information on how to apply for a re-entry visa.)
</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to ensure you have the correct visa (if required)
for the country you intend travelling to. Please note that you must obtain a
visa from the UK authorities before travelling to Northern Ireland (Counties
Antrim, Armagh, Derry, Down, Fermanagh and Tyrone). Information on applying for
a visa to visit the UK is available from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-ukvi-outside-uk">UK Visas and
Immigration</a>.</p>

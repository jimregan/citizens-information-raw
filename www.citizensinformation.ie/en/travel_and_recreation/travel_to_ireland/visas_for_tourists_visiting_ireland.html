<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Citizens of certain countries must apply for an entry visa before they
travel to Ireland. Information on those who need an entry visa is available in
our document: <a href="../../moving_country/moving_to_ireland/coming_to_live_in_ireland/visa_requirements_for_entering_ireland.html">Visa
requirements for entering Ireland</a>. </p>

<p>If you require a visit/holiday visa and do not have one when you arrive in
Ireland, you will not be allowed to enter the country. A visit/holiday visa is
for a short-term stay and will not exceed a maximum of 90 days.</p>

<p>If you are a citizen of an EU/EEA member state or Switzerland, you <span>do
not require</span> a visit/holiday visa to travel to Ireland. You have the
right to enter and reside in Ireland for a period of up to 3 months simply by
presenting a valid passport or national identity card; no other formality is
required. There is no additional conditions concerning the minimum validity of
duration of the identity card or passport. The members of the EEA are the 28
countries of the European Union (EU), together with Iceland, Norway and
Liechtenstein). There is <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Family%20Members%20of%20EU_EEA%20_Swiss%20citizens">information
for non-EEA nationals applying for a short-stay visa to accompany or join an EU
citizen family member</a> in Ireland on the Irish Naturalisation &amp;
Immigration Service (INIS) website.</p>

<p>Even if you do not require a visa to enter Ireland, all non-EEA nationals
must obtain <a href="../../moving_country/moving_to_ireland/coming_to_live_in_ireland/permission_to_land_in_ireland.html">permission
to enter the State</a> by reporting to an Immigration Officer at the port of
entry. You should have supporting documentation relating to the purpose of your
visit (see below).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Irish%20Short%20Stay%20Visa%20Waiver%20Programme">Short
Stay Visa Waiver Programme</a> allows nationals of a number of Eastern
European, Middle East and Asian countries who have a short-term UK visa to come
to Ireland without the need for a separate Irish visa. This programme has been
extended to 31 October 2021.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/British%20Irish%20Visa%20Scheme">British
Irish Visa Scheme</a> applies to visitors from China since 20 October 2014 and
to visitors from India since 9 February 2015. This scheme allows visitors from
these countries to travel freely within the Common Travel Area (in this case,
Ireland and the UK but not the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man), using
either an Irish or UK visa.</p>

<h3>Documentation required for all visa applications</h3>

<p>The following information describes the minimum documentation that you
<span>must</span> provide with any visa application. If any of this
documentation is missing your application will be refused.</p>

<p>All documents must be in English. If any document is in another language,
you must <a href="../../justice/civil_law/notaries_public.html">provide a
notarised translation</a> as well as the original document.</p>

<p>For the particular documentation needed for a tourist visa, see information
headed 'Travelling to Ireland as a tourist', below.</p>
<ul><li>You must <span>complete all sections</span> of the application form. </li>
  <li>You must <span>sign the form</span> yourself. The only exception is for
    children under 18 - the parent(s) may sign in this case. </li>
  <li>If a child (under 18 years of age) is travelling alone, <span>both
    parents/guardians must have given consent</span>. If the child is
    travelling with one parent, the <span>consent of the other parent</span> is
    required. Where only one parent has total custody and access rights, you
    must provide <span>official evidence</span> of this. </li>
  <li>You must have a passport which is valid for a period lasting <span>at
    least 6 months</span> after the date you propose to leave Ireland. </li>
  <li>You must be able to prove that you can <span>support yourself</span> for
    the duration of your stay in Ireland. A detailed bank statement, covering
    the 6 months before you apply for the visa, and showing sufficient funds,
    is required. </li>
  <li>You must provide details of any <span>members of your family</span> who
    are in Ireland or any other EU country. </li>
  <li>You must also give details of any previous applications that you have
    made for a visa to enter Ireland. </li>
</ul><h3>Travelling to Ireland as a tourist</h3>

<p>If you will be visiting Ireland for a short period (less than 3 months) and
you require a visa, you <span>must </span>present the following documents with
your completed and signed visa application form:</p>
<ul><li>Full details of the <span>reason for your visit</span> - for example to
    see friends or family. </li>
  <li>If you plan to stay in a hotel, you will need <span>written
    confirmation</span> of the hotel booking containing the dates of your
    proposed stay. </li>
  <li>A <span>letter from a reference in Ireland</span> inviting you to come to
    Ireland. The letter should include contact details for the reference,
    proposed dates for your stay and details of where you will be staying
    during your visit. </li>
  <li>Written undertakings from both yourself and your reference, confirming
    that you will observe the conditions of your visa, that you will not become
    a burden on the State, and that you will leave the State on the expiration
    of your permission to remain. </li>
  <li>Details of your relationship to your reference, or how you are known to
    each other, along with <span>supporting evidence</span> of this. </li>
  <li>If your reference is not an Irish citizen, evidence of their
    <span>permission to remain in Ireland</span>. (That is, a copy of their
    Certificate of Registration (GNIB card) and copy of their passport showing
    immigration stamps) </li>
  <li>Evidence of how you intend to finance your trip and support yourself for
    the duration of your visit, allowing for any unforeseen events such as
    illness. A detailed bank statement, covering a 6 month period immediately
    prior to your visa application, and showing sufficient funds to cover all
    costs, is required. </li>
  <li>Evidence that you are obliged to return to your country of residence.
    This evidence can take the form of a letter from your employer detailing
    when you are expected to return to work or a letter from a college
    specifying the date on which your course of study re-commences. If you do
    not work or study, a letter from a person in authority may be sufficient.
  </li>
</ul><p>There is more information on the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Visit%20Tourist">documentation
required for a visit or holiday visa</a> on the website of the Irish
Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of the Department of Justice and
Equality. </p>

<h3>Permission to land</h3>

<p>All non-EEA nationals, including those with visas, must obtain permission to
enter the State by reporting to an Immigration Officer at the port of entry.
The length of time you will be allowed to stay in Ireland is determined by the
Immigration Officer but will never exceed a maximum of 90 days.</p>

<p>You should have supporting documentation relating to the purpose of your
visit on your person when coming through immigration. You can read more in our
document on <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/coming_to_live_in_ireland/permission_to_land_in_ireland.html">permission
to land in Ireland</a>. </p>

<h3>What do I do if I want to leave for a short while?</h3>

<p>The visiting/holiday visa issued to you allows you to enter the State once.
If you have wish to leave for a short while and then return you must apply for
a re-entry visa. (See 'How to apply' below for information on how to apply for
a re-entry visa.) </p>

<p>It is your responsibility to ensure you have the correct visa (if required)
for the country you intend travelling to. Please note that you must obtain a
visa from the UK authorities before travelling to Northern Ireland (Counties
Antrim, Armagh, Derry, Down, Fermanagh and Tyrone). Information on applying for
a visa to visit the UK is available from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-ukvi-outside-uk">UK Visas and
Immigration</a>.</p>

<h3>What do I do after my arrival if I wish to stay in Ireland for longer than
3 months?</h3>

<p>Visit/holiday visas are only granted for short term stays and never exceed
90 days. It is not possible to extend your stay beyond 90 days. You must leave
the State on or before the date which has been stamped on your passport by the
Immigration Officer when you entered.</p>

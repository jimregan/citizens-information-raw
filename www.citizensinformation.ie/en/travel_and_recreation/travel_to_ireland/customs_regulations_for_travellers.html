<h3>Security checks on travellers</h3>

<p>Customs officers in Ireland are allowed carry out <a shape="rect" href="examination_of_travellers_baggage_by_customs_and_excise_officers.html">selective
checks on all travellers</a> at all points of entry to Ireland (air and sea).
These checks are to ensure that you are not carrying prohibited or restricted
goods, and to combat smuggling. </p>

<h3>Travelling to Ireland from the EU</h3>

<p><strong>Cash controls</strong></p>

<p>Ireland has no restriction on the amount of cash you can carry in or out of
the country, or a requirement to declare it, when travelling within the EU.
However, under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0015/sec0038.html#zza15y1994s38">Criminal
Justice Act 1994 Section 38(1)</a> as amended by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0001/sec0020.html#sec20">Proceeds
of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005 Section 20</a>, if you are carrying at least
€6,348.69 in cash, a customs officer may seize and detain the cash. The
customs officer must have reasonable grounds for believing the cash represents
the proceeds of crime or is intended for use in criminal conduct.</p>

<p><strong>Excise duties and VAT on goods</strong></p>

<p>Since June 30, 1999, the sale of duty-free goods to those travelling within
the European Union (EU) has been abolished. This means that you will no longer
be able to buy goods that are free of excise duty and VAT (value-added tax) if
you are travelling within the EU. Any goods you buy within the EU (with the
exception of food, drink and tobacco products for on-board consumption) will
now be subject to normal rates of excise duty and VAT. Duty-free sales will
continue as before, if you are travelling to destinations outside the EU. </p>

<p><strong>Goods bought in another EU country</strong></p>

<p>You will not be charged any extra duty or VAT on purchases where the duty
and VAT has been paid (for example, goods bought in shops, supermarkets, etc.)
in another EU country, provided the goods are for your personal use. </p>

<p>If your purchases are equivalent to or less than the quantities set out in
the table below, they will usually be regarded as being for your personal use.
If you exceed these quantities, you may have to demonstrate at Customs that the
goods are for your personal use. </p>

or Romania.</p>

<p>You are <span>not entitled to alcohol or tobacco allowances if you are aged
under 17 years</span>. </p>

<p>You should keep any receipts as proof that you have paid duty and VAT. </p>

<p><strong>Bringing in meat or dairy products</strong></p>

<p>Only products which have been produced in accordance with EU rules may be
imported for personal consumption. As a guideline, quantities should not exceed
10 kg. Generally, the products are on sale to the public in the EU country of
origin, are appropriately packaged and have an identifying EU health mark. An
EU health mark is an oval stamp with: </p>
<ul><li>The country code on the upper part, for example, UK </li>
  <li>An approval number in the centre </li>
  <li>The initials EC (European Commission indication) on the lower part. </li>
</ul><h3>Travelling to Ireland from countries outside the EU</h3>

<p><strong>Cash controls</strong> </p>

<p>Since 15 June 2007 if you are entering or leaving the European Union and
carrying €10,000 or more cash you must make a declaration to the Customs
authority of the member state you are entering or leaving. Under Regulation
(EC) 1889/2005 you must lodge the declaration at the airport, seaport or land
frontier through which you are entering the EU – see “How to apply”
below. If you are travelling to or from the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man
you also must make a declaration. Cash includes:</p>
<ul><li>Currency in the form of banknotes or coins </li>
  <li>Bank drafts, cheques or money orders in bearer form, endorsed without
    restriction or with payee’s name omitted.</li>
</ul><p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0015/sec0038.html#zza15y1994s38">Criminal

<strong>Goods</strong> 

<p>You are allowed to bring in to Ireland the goods shown in the table below,
(subject to maximum limits) if you are travelling to Ireland from any country
outside the EU (this includes the Canary Islands, the Channel Islands and
Gibraltar). </p>

<p>The goods in question may have been bought either duty-free/tax-free or
duty-paid/tax-paid outside the EU. </p>

fractional basis, i.e., you are allowed to bring in ½ litre of spirits plus 1
litre of port or 100 cigarettes plus 50 cigarillos. </p>

<p>You are not entitled to alcohol or tobacco allowances if you are under 17.

<h3>Drugs</h3>

<p>It is an offence to import or carry on your person controlled substances
(drugs) when travelling to or from Ireland. (Examples of controlled substances
are cannabis, cocaine, heroin and amphetamines). The Customs National Drugs
Team has dog units located at airports and ferryports. The drug detector dogs
are trained to detect drugs such as cannabis, cocaine, heroin and amphetamines.
<a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/criminal_law/criminal_offences/drug_offences.html">There are
penalties for drugs offences in Ireland</a>. </p>

<h3>Bringing in meat or dairy products</h3>

<p>You are prohibited from importing meat or dairy products for your personal
consumption from almost all non-EU countries. Limited quantities of certain
other products may be imported provided their country of origin is an EU
approved country. Further information is available on the Department of
Agriculture, Food and the Marine website on <a shape="rect" href="http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/agri-foodindustry/tradeimportsexports/importofanimalsandanimalproducts/personalimportsofanimalproducts/">animal
products imports for personal consumption</a>. </p>

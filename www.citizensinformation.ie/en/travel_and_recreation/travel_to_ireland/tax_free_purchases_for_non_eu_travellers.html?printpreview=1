<h3>Retail Export Scheme</h3>

<p>Visitors to Ireland from outside the European Union (EU) can buy goods in
Ireland to take home with them and benefit from tax relief. Tax relief is not
allowed on services, for example, hotel accommodation, meals or car hire. The
visitor must provide proof that they are a visitor from outside the EU when
making each purchase. The proof includes evidence of the place of residence,
inbound and outbound flight dates and a signed declaration.</p>

<p>The tax relief is provided under the Retail Export Scheme which operates in
two ways.</p>
<ul><li>The tourist pays <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/duties_and_vat/value_added_tax.html">Value-Added
    Tax (VAT)</a> when making purchases and subsequently gets a refund from the
    relevant retailer or VAT-refunding agency when the retailer or the agency
    receive proof that the good or goods have been exported.</li>
  <li>In certain retail outlets, the goods are sold tax-free at the point of
    sale with or without the involvement of a VAT-refunding agency. The goods
    must be paid for by credit card. If the retailer or the agency does not
    receive proof that the goods have been exported, they charge the VAT on the
    goods to the tourist's credit card account.</li>
</ul><p>Before making a purchase, the tourist should confirm with the retailer that
they operate the scheme. They should also clarify whether the retailer is
operating the scheme in their own right or with a VAT-refunding agency.</p>

<p>If an agency is being used, the tourist should follow the agency’s
specific procedures when making the purchase. When they are leaving Ireland,
the tourist should deposit the documentation they were given for the purchase
with the agency. (Some VAT-refunding agencies use a plastic card to record a
tourist’s purchases by swiping the card when making a purchase.) If VAT was
paid, the agency will make the necessary refund within 25 working days if the
documentation is complete – see ‘VAT-refunding agencies’ below.</p>

<p>If the goods are being purchased without the involvement of an agency, the
retailer should issue the tourist with an export voucher for the purchase. When
leaving Ireland, the tourist should get the voucher certified by Customs at the
airport. The certified voucher is returned to the retailer. If VAT has been
paid the retailer refunds the VAT (less any processing fee).</p>


<h3>Tax relief for EU residents</h3>

<p>Tax relief can also be given to EU residents who can provide evidence that
they are going to live outside the EU for a period of at least one year. </p>

<h3>Goods that have been exported directly by retailers</h3>

<p>In addition to the Retail Export Scheme, retailers can also send directly to
the tourist's home (outside the EU only) goods ordered or purchased by them.
Where this takes place, no tax is payable by the tourist.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Conditions attached to tax relief</h3>
<ul><li>The goods must be exported out of the EU within 3 months from the end of
    the month in which they are bought. For example, goods bought during the
    month of January must be exported by 30th April. </li>
  <li>The tourist must supply documentary proof that the goods have been
    exported. </li>
</ul><h3>Documentary proof</h3>

<p>Usually, proof of export is the export voucher stamped by Customs at the
last point of departure from the EU. For example, you buy goods in Ireland and
then travel to Great Britain before you leave the EU, you must have the
relevant documentation stamped by British Customs authorities. Irish Customs
authorities will only stamp the documentation if you have a ticket for a
destination outside of the EU, valid not later than the end of the third month
from the date on which the goods were purchased.</p>

<p>If you are unable to have the documentation stamped by the relevant Customs
authorities at the point of departure or have not used the services of a
VAT-refunding agency, you can still have the documentation stamped in your own
country by a person of official status (for example, by Customs or the police)
before returning it to the retailer in Ireland.</p>


<h3>VAT-refunding agencies</h3>

<p>Many retailers operate the refund scheme using VAT-refunding agencies that
arrange for the tourist or visitor to benefit from the tax concession.
VAT-refunding agencies operate independently of the tax authorities:</p>

<p>There are three variations in how these agencies operate:</p>
<ul><li>The goods are sold tax-free at the point of sale: You fill out the
    agency’s tax-free form, have it signed in the shop, attach your purchase
    receipt to it, and return it to the agency. You will subsequently be
    obliged to pay the tax due by credit card transaction, if the documentation
    is not handed in at the airport or subsequently returned to the agency.</li>
  <li>Tax is paid at the point of sale: You follow the same procedure as above
    and the tax is subsequently refunded to you at the airport when you are
    leaving.</li>
  <li>Tax is paid at the point of sale: You follow the same procedure as above
    and the tax is subsequently refunded by the agency to you, either by post
    or by credit card transfer.</li>
</ul><p>Some agencies use a card to record your purchases rather than forms. You
swipe the card each time you make a purchase. You should register the card
before leaving Ireland and return the card to the agency.</p>

<p>Individual tax-free forms for purchases of up to €2,000 (including VAT)
may be lodged directly with the agency refund booths at the airport without a
Customs stamp. Documentation for individual purchases of over €2,000
(including VAT) must always be presented by you to Customs for stamping.</p>

<p>It is important for you to retain your own copy of the documentation
received from the retailer for future reference. If you are mailing the
documentation back for a refund, it is advisable to keep a photocopy.</p>


<h3>High value goods</h3>

<p>Where an individual item costs €2,000 or more (including VAT), it must be
presented to Customs, along with the appropriate documentation, before any VAT
refund will be approved.</p>

<h3>If you do not receive your refund</h3>

<p>The retailer or agency is obliged to make the refund within 25 working days
of receiving your documentation. If a refund is not received, you should
contact the retailer or agency concerned.</p>

<p>If you are having difficulty getting your refund, you can contact the
Revenue Commissioners (see ‘Where to apply’ below). It should be noted,
however, that the Revenue Commissioners do not administer the Retail Export
Scheme OR make refunds directly to tourists under the scheme.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>In order to cover administration costs, retailers and VAT-refunding agencies
usually charge an administration fee. All retailers and VAT-refunding agencies
are obliged to clearly indicate the level of this fee. Similarly, agencies
making refunds in foreign currency are obliged to indicate the exchange rate
used. </p>

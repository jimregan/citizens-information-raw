<h3>Selective checks to protect society</h3>

<p>Customs and Excise officers are allowed to carry out checks on <a shape="rect" href="customs_regulations_for_travellers.html">imported goods
(including personal baggage)</a> to prevent the smuggling of dutiable,
excisable or prohibited goods. These checks are carried out routinely on
travellers arriving from outside the EU or from outside the EU via an EU Member
State. These travellers are required to make a Customs declaration. </p>

<p>If you are arriving in Ireland from outside the EU via an EU Member State,
you must make a Customs declaration unless all your baggage was cleared by
Customs officers at your first airport or point of arrival in the EU. (Cash
controls require that if you are <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/customs/leaflets/customs-excise-cash-controls.html">entering
or leaving the European Union and carrying â‚¬10,000 or more cash</a> you must
make a special declaration to the Customs authority of the member state you are
entering or leaving.)</p>

<p>If all of your baggage was cleared by Customs officers upon your arrival in
the EU, you can proceed through the Blue Channel. Customs declarations are
usually done by means of the Red/Green Channel system. Travellers should go
through the Red Channel if:</p>
<ul><li>They have more than the allowances that they are entitled to, or </li>
  <li>They are in doubt about whether they have more than the permitted
    allowances or </li>
  <li>They have prohibited or restricted goods. </li>
</ul><p>Travellers should go through the Green Channel if they have:</p>
<ul><li>Only the allowances that they are permitted and </li>
  <li>No prohibited or restricted goods. </li>
</ul><p>Travellers arriving from outside the EU may be questioned and their baggage
may be examined. Travellers arriving from within the EU are not required to
make a Customs declaration and should proceed through the Blue Channel.
However, Customs officers have the power to question these travellers if there
is reason to doubt that they have arrived from an EU Member State. Customs
officers may also intervene if they have reason to believe that prohibited or
restricted goods (including drugs) are being imported/exported or if they
believe an offence in respect of excisable products is being committed. </p>

<p>These procedures are in place to help protect society and to guard against
tax or duty fraud. </p>

<h3>Searches of travellers</h3>

<p>Travellers may be searched by Customs officers only where an officer has
reason to suspect that they are:</p>
<ul><li>Carrying uncustomed or prohibited goods (uncustomed goods are goods that
    are imported over and above the personal traveller's allowance and that are
    not declared to Customs) or </li>
  <li>Carrying drugs on their person. </li>
</ul><p>In cases where a Customs officer suspects that the person is carrying
uncustomed or prohibited goods, he or she must go before a superior officer of
the Customs and Excise service who will decide whether there are sufficient
grounds for the search to be carried out. </p>

<p>In practice, most searches are carried out by Customs officers in respect of
drugs. If you are to be searched on suspicion of carrying drugs:</p>
<ul><li>You must understand the reason for the search. It has been known for drug
    smugglers to use people with disabilities or children to carry drugs. If
    Customs officers are required to search a child or a person with a
    disability, it is done in the presence of a parent or guardian. </li>
  <li>You can only be searched by an officer of the same sex </li>
  <li>No person of the opposite sex can be present where the search involves
    the removal of clothing other than hat, coat jacket, gloves or similar
    articles of clothing unless the presence of the person is necessary as a
    result of your violent conduct </li>
  <li>You have the right to request that the search be carried out by a medical
    practitioner </li>
  <li>The search must be conducted in a room to which the public does not have
    free access. Windows must be screened and doors secured to ensure complete
    privacy. </li>
  <li>If you refuse to be searched, you may be arrested without warrant by the
    Customs officer and may be prosecuted. If you are arrested by Customs
    officers, you will be taken to the nearest police station to be charged
    with an offence. </li>
  <li>If Customs officers find controlled drugs, you may prosecuted. You may be
    arrested or proceeded against later by summons. </li>
</ul><p>Customs officers keep records of all searches that they conduct. </p>

<p>Additionally, everyone detained by Customs officers has the right of:</p>
<ul><li>Access to a solicitor </li>
  <li>Access to a doctor </li>
  <li>Informing a relative/third party of their situation </li>
</ul><p>If you feel you have been unfairly treated by Customs officers you may make
a complaint - see "How to apply" below.</p>

<h3>Types of Search</h3>

<h3>Pat down search</h3>

<p>A pat down search involves a search of outer clothing without the removal of
clothing.</p>

<h3>Intimate body search</h3>

<p>An intimate body search may involve the removal and search of clothing and a
visual examination of the undressed person by an officer or medical
practitioner to verify if drugs are being concealed. </p>

<p>You cannot be subjected to an intimate body search for drugs unless:</p>
<ul><li>Customs officers have reasonable cause to suspect that you are in
    possession of a controlled drug. </li>
</ul><h3>Internal body search</h3>

<p>Customs officers do not carry out internal body searches. </p>

<h3>Penalties for carrying uncustomed goods</h3>

<p>The penalties for carrying uncustomed goods are generally three times the
duty paid value of the goods in question. The goods are also liable to
forfeiture and can be seized along with any other articles used for concealing
or conveying the uncustomed goods or packed with them. </p>

<h3>Penalties for carrying illegal drugs</h3>

<p>The penalties for smuggling illegal drugs are set out in the Misuse of Drugs
Act , as amended. These penalties range from a fine in the case of a person
convicted of importing a drug such as cannabis for personal use to life
imprisonment for the most serious offences, which concern the importation of
drugs for supply to others. </p>

<p>If you have any <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/customs/leaflets/customs-drug-watch.pdf">information
in relation to drug smuggling in Ireland (pdf)</a>, you can send a completed <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/customs/forms/customs-drugs-watch.html">Customs
Drugs Watch report form</a> to Customs Drugs Law Enforcement- see "Where to

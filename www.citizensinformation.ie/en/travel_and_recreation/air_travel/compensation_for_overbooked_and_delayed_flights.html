<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Air passengers have specific consumer rights under European law. <a href="http://www.aviationreg.ie/_fileupload/Image/Regulation%20EC261%202004.pdf">EU
Regulation 261/2004</a> provides protection when:</p>
<ul><li>You are denied boarding against your will</li>
  <li>Your flight is cancelled</li>
  <li>Your flight is delayed</li>
</ul><p>The Regulation applies to all passengers departing from an EU/EEA airport.
It also applies to passengers departing from an airport outside of the EU/EEA
but arriving at an EU/EEA airport on an EU/EEA licensed carrier (unless they
have already received compensation or assistance in that non-EU/EEA
country).</p>

<p>The Regulation does not apply if you are travelling free of charge or at a
fare that is reduced and is not available directly or indirectly to the public.
Tickets purchased under frequent flyer programmes or similar commercial
programmes are not considered reduced fare tickets.</p>

<h3>Check-in</h3>

<p>When you purchase a ticket for air travel, you enter into an agreement with
the airline. One of the terms of this agreement is that you must confirm that
you will be ready to take the flight on the date of travel (confirming your
reservation) and you must present yourself at check-in to demonstrate that you
have a valid ticket and are ready to fly on the date on your ticket.</p>

<h3>Reservation not confirmed or not checked in</h3>

<p>If you have not confirmed your reservation in time or presented yourself for
check-in at the time stipulated by the airline, the Regulation does not apply.
The airline can refuse to allow you to board the aircraft as you have not
honoured your part of the contract with the airline and the airline can
legitimately argue that you have breached the terms of your contract with
them.</p>

<p>If you have been denied access to the aircraft in these circumstances, the
airline is not obliged to offer you any compensation nor are you are entitled
to any compensation. The airline may, however, agree to accommodate you on a
later flight (without or without charge) if there is availability. If you did
not confirm your reservation or you did not present yourself for check-in at
the stipulated time, it depends on the custom and practice of the individual
airline as to whether or not you must pay again for the flight.</p>

<h3>Reservation confirmed and checked in</h3>

<p>If you are denied boarding, or your flight has been cancelled or delayed,
and the Regulation does apply, the airline must provide you with a written
notice setting out the rules for compensation and assistance. You must be
offered 2 free telephone calls, fax messages, or emails. In addition, a sign
must be displayed at the check-in area referring to air passenger rights under
the Regulation.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lf7093">Denied boarding</h2>

<p>Denied boarding means that the airline has refused to accommodate you on
scheduled flights and charters although you have a valid ticket, you have
confirmed your reservation on your flight and you have presented yourself for
check-in within the required time limit as stipulated by the airline.</p>

<p>Denied boarding happens when airlines sell more tickets for a scheduled
flight than there are seats on the aircraft.</p>

<h3>Volunteers</h3>

<p>Where a flight is overbooked the airline will first call for volunteers to
surrender their confirmed reservations to the airline in exchange for agreed
benefits. The volunteers are also entitled to a choice of:</p>
<ul><li>Refund of the cost of their ticket within 7 days if not wishing to travel
    or</li>
  <li>Re-routing to their final destination at the earliest opportunity or</li>
  <li>Re-routing at a later date at the passenger’s convenience, subject to
    availability of seats</li>
</ul><h3>Non-volunteers</h3>

<p>If there are not enough volunteers, the airline may deny boarding to
passengers against their will but must compensate them and offer the
appropriate assistance set out in the Regulation.</p>

<p>You must also be offered a choice of:</p>
<ul><li>Refund of the cost of your ticket within 7 days if not wishing to travel
    or</li>
  <li>Re-routing to your final destination at the earliest opportunity or</li>
  <li>Re-routing at a later date at your convenience, subject to availability
    of seats</li>
</ul><p>A refund is a full refund of the ticket for the part or parts of the journey
you have not made and for the part or parts you have already made, if the
flight is no longer serving any purpose to your original travel plan. When
relevant, it also includes a return flight to your first point of departure at
the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>If you choose a <strong>refund</strong>, compensation must also be paid. The
amount you are entitled to depends on the distance of the flight that you have
not been allowed to board. See <a href="#Compensati">Compensation</a> below.</p>

<p>If you choose <strong>re-routing</strong>, the compensation that is paid
depends on the length of delay past the original planned time in arriving at
your final destination. See <a href="#Compensati">Compensation</a> below.</p>

<p>Free meals and refreshments must be offered in reasonable relation to the
waiting time. Hotel accommodation must also be offered free of charge where a
stay of one or more nights becomes necessary, as well as transport between the
hotel and the airport.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lad67b">Cancelled flights</h2>

<p>Where your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a choice of:</p>
<ul><li>Refund of the cost of your ticket within 7 days or</li>
  <li>Re-routing to your final destination at the earliest opportunity or</li>
  <li>Re-routing at a later date at your convenience, subject to availability
    of seats</li>
</ul><p>You may also be entitled to compensation.</p>

<h3>When compensation is not payable</h3>

<p>You are not entitled to compensation if:</p>
<ul><li>You have received at least 2 weeks’ notice of the cancellation; or</li>
  <li>You have received between 2 weeks and 7 days’ notice but you have been
    offered an alternative flight departing no more than 2 hours before your
    original departure time and arriving at your final destination less than 4
    hours after your original scheduled time of arrival; or</li>
  <li>You have received less than 7 days’ notice but you have been offered an
    alternative flight departing no more than 1 hour before your original
    departure time and arriving at your final destination less than 2 hours
    after your original scheduled time of arrival.</li>
</ul><p>If the airline can prove that the cancellation was caused by an
extraordinary circumstance which could not have been avoided, even if all
reasonable measures had been taken, no compensation is payable. Examples of
extraordinary circumstances may include weather conditions, air traffic control
restrictions, security risks and industrial disputes that affect the operation
of the flight.</p>

<h3>Refunds and re-routing</h3>

<p>If you choose a refund and you are entitled to compensation, the amount you
are entitled to depends on the type of flight. See <a href="#Compensati">Compensation</a> below.</p>

<p>Where the choice is re-routing, the compensation that is paid depends on the
length of delay past the original planned time in arriving at your final
destination. See <a href="#Compensati">Compensation</a> below.</p>

<p>Free meals and refreshments must be offered in reasonable relation to the
waiting time. Hotel accommodation must also be offered free of charge where a
stay of one or more nights becomes necessary, as well as transport between the
hotel and the airport.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l7c71f">Delayed flights</h2>

<p>Whether a delayed flight comes within the terms of the Regulation depends
upon the distance of the route involved and the length of the delay. The
following flights are covered by the Regulation:</p>
<ul><li>Delays of 2 hours or more in the case of flights of 1500 km or less</li>
  <li>Delays of 3 hours or more in the case of all flights within the EU of
    more than 1500 km, and of all other flights between 1500 and 3500 km</li>
  <li>Delays of 4 hours or more in the case of all other flights</li>
</ul><p>If your delayed flight is covered by the Regulation, free meals and
refreshments must be offered in reasonable relation to the waiting time. Hotel
accommodation must also be offered free of charge where a stay of one or more
nights becomes necessary, as well as transport between the hotel and the
airport.</p>

<h3>Refund</h3>

<p>If the flight is delayed at least 5 hours, you must be offered a refund of
your ticket instead of flying. A refund is a full refund of the ticket for the
part or parts of the journey you have not made and for the part or parts you
already made if the flight is no longer serving any purpose to your original
travel plan. When relevant, it also includes a return flight to your first
point of departure, at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<h3>Delays over 3 hours</h3>

<p>The Regulation does not state that compensation is payable in cases of
delay. However, on 19 November 2009 the European Court of Justice ruled in the
cases of <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/legal_service/arrets/07c402_en.pdf">Sturgeon v
Condor Flugdienst GmbH and Bock and Others v Air France SA (pdf)</a> that
compensation similar to that paid for cancelled flights may be payable in delay
situations where the delay exceeds 3 hours. This right was upheld by the
European Court of Justice in further cases on 23 October 2012. The compensation
that is paid depends on the distance of the flight and the length of delay past
the original planned time in arriving at your final destination. See <a href="#Compensati">Compensation</a> below.</p>

<p>If the airline can prove that the delay was caused by an extraordinary
circumstance which could not have been avoided, even if all reasonable measures
had been taken, no compensation is payable.<a name="Compensati" id="Compensati"></a></p>

<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l7e93e">Compensation</h2>

<h3>Compensation when getting a refund</h3>

<p>Where a refund of the cost of the ticket is chosen and you are also entitled
to compensation, the following compensation must be paid:</p>

<table border="1"><col><col><tbody><tr><td><strong>Type of flight</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Compensation</strong></td>
    </tr><tr><td>Flights of 1,500 km or less</td>
      <td>€250</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Flights of over 1,500 km within the EU and <br>
        other flights between 1,500 and 3,500 km</td>
      <td>€400</td>
    </tr><tr><td>All other flights</td>
      <td>€600</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><h3>Compensation when re-routed</h3>

<p>When the choice is re-routing and you are entitled to compensation, the
amount of compensation you are entitled to depends on the length of delay past
your original planned arrival time as follows:</p>

<table border="1"><col><col><col><tbody><tr><td><strong>Type of flight</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Delay</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Compensation</strong></td>
    </tr><tr><td>Flights of 1500km or less</td>
      <td>2 hours or less</td>
      <td>€125</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Flights of 1500km or less</td>
      <td>more than 2 hours</td>
      <td>€250</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Flights of over 1,500 km within the EU and <br>
        other flights between 1,500 and 3,500 km</td>
      <td>3 hours or less</td>
      <td>€200</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Flights of over 1,500 km within the EU and <br>
        other flights between 1,500 and 3,500 km</td>
      <td>more than 3 hours</td>
      <td>€400</td>
    </tr><tr><td>All other flights</td>
      <td>4 hours or less</td>
      <td>€300</td>
    </tr><tr><td>All other flights</td>
      <td>more than 4 hours</td>
      <td>€600</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><h3>Upgrading and downgrading seats</h3>

<p>If you are offered a seat in a higher class than your original booking, the
airline cannot charge you an additional payment for this seat.</p>

<p>If you agree to be placed in a lower class than on your original booking,
you are entitled to reimbursement of a percentage of the difference in price.
In other words, if you booked a business/first class seat and the airline
offers you a seat in a lower class it must refund you a percentage of the
ticket price you originally paid. The percentage of the refund is calculated as
follows:</p>
<ul><li>30% of the ticket price for flights of 1,500 km or less or</li>
  <li>50% of the ticket price for intra-EU flights of more than 1,500 km and
    for all other flights between 1,500 and 3,500 km</li>
  <li>75% of the price for all flights greater than 3,500 km</li>
</ul><h3>Package travel</h3>

<p>If you are denied boarding, or your flight is cancelled or delayed, on a
flight that has been sold as part of a package tour (that is, flight and
accommodation), the airline is obliged to compensate the tour operator who has
concluded a contract with you. The tour operator entered into a contract with
you when it sold you your package tour and these rights are also protected in
European law. Without prejudice to the rights under these laws, the tour
operator is obliged to pass on to you the compensation paid by the airline to
it.</p>

<div class="topic further_info">
<h2 class="further_info" id="l4a431">Enforcement of your passenger rights</h2>

<p>If you have a complaint about the assistance and compensation you have
received for denied boarding or cancelled or delayed flights, you must begin by
contacting your airline directly.</p>

<p>If you believe your entitlement to compensation/assistance has not been met,
you should then make a complaint to the <a href="http://www.aviationreg.ie/EUEEA_Enforcement_Bodies/Default.212.html">appropriate
national enforcement body</a>. Each member state is responsible for departures
from airports within its territory and arrivals into such airports from third
countries on EU/EEA-licensed carriers. If you have a complaint about a flight
returning to Ireland from the EU/EEA, you contact the national enforcement body
in the EU/EEA state your flight departed from.</p>

<p>The Commission for Aviation Regulation is the national enforcement body in
Ireland. It deals with complaints arising from flights departing from Irish
airports or those arriving at an Irish airport from outside the EU/EEA on an
EUEEA-licensed carrier. Information on <a href="http://www.aviationreg.ie/Complaint_Procedure/Default.508.html">how to
make a complaint to the Regulator</a> is available on its website. It also has
information on your rights on <a href="http://www.flightrights.ie/">flightrights.ie</a>.</p>

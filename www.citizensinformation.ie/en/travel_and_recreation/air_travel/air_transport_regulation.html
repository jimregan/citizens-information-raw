<p>Civil air transport (including commercial and private air services) in
Ireland is regulated by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. The
European Union (EU) has a liberalised air transport market, meaning that there
are no restrictions on frequency, flights or routes that airlines of Member
States fly within the EU/European Economic Area (EEA). The liberalised air
transport market in the EU has meant more frequent flights, greater
availability, further destinations, lower fares and increased choice for the
traveller. Airlines from countries outside of the EU/EEA must request
permission each time they wish to fly to, from or over Ireland and these
requests are forwarded in writing to the Department of Transport, Tourism and
Sport where they are examined to ensure compliance with the highest standards
of safety, airworthiness and insurance. (Military air transport in Ireland is
regulated by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.defence.ie/website.nsf/hp?openform">Department of
Defence</a>).</p>

<h3>Airports</h3>

<p>There are a total of 9 airports in Ireland. Three of these airports - <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dublinairport.com/home.aspx">Dublin</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.corkairport.com/index.asp">Cork</a> and <a shape="rect" href="http://www.shannonairport.ie/gns/Passengers/Home.aspx">Shannon</a> - are
owned by the Irish government and operated on its behalf by separate airport
authorities. (That is, Dublin, Cork, and Shannon Airport Authorities). The
other Irish airports at Waterford, Knock, Galway, Sligo, Donegal and Kerry are
privately owned. </p>

<p>Under <a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/transport/mobility_and_passenger_rights/l24132_en.htm">Regulation
(EC) No 1107/2006</a> airport authorities are responsible for ensuring that an
intending passenger with reduced mobility receives the necessary assistance
from designated points of arrival at the airport to the point of boarding the
aircraft. There is a similar provision for passengers who are landing at an EU
airport. The Commission for Aviation Regulation is the National Enforcement
Body for this Regulation in Ireland. </p>

<p>If you are travelling to/from an airport in Ireland, you should notify your
airline at least 48 hours in advance if you require any special facilities. </p>

<h3>Air accidents and incidents within Ireland</h3>

<p>The Air Accident Investigation Unit is located at the Department of
Transport and has responsibility for investigating all aircraft accidents and
incidents within Ireland. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.aaiu.ie/reports/aaiu-investigation-reports">Reports of all air
accidents, incidents and investigations within Ireland are available to
download</a> or by post and you can register to receive e-mail notifications of
new postings on the Unit's website. </p>

<h3>Irish Aviation Authority</h3>

<p>The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) is a state agency that has responsibility
for a range of operational and regulatory functions and services relating to
the safety and technical aspects of civil aviation in Ireland. The IAA, for
example, operates the Air Traffic Control Centres around Ireland and monitor
Ireland's airspace. In addition, the IAA issues licences to aircraft pilots,
registers aircraft and ensures that civil aviation in Ireland adheres to the
highest international standards of safety. </p>

<h3>Commission for Aviation Regulation</h3>

<p>The Commission for Aviation Regulation is responsible for setting the
maximum level of airport and aviation terminal services charges and also has an
important role in licensing the travel trade in Ireland. It grants licences to
both tour operators and travel agents. As part of this function, the Commission
administers a bonding scheme. The Commission also licenses Irish airlines,
approves groundhandling services providers under regulations implementing EU
legislation and assesses capacity at Irish airports and decides the manner in
which take-off and landing slots are administered.</p>

<p>The Commission also has a consumer protection role. It enforces EU
legislation covering <a href="air_passenger_rights_in_the_eu.html">air
passenger rights</a> and the provision of assistance to passengers with reduced
mobility. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>As part of general air transport security measures, you are not allowed to
bring certain items into a restricted area of an Irish airport or on board an
aircraft leaving an EU airport. This is because these items have the potential
to be used as weapons. The rules regarding air transport security are in place
internationally and have been noticeably increased in recent years. </p>

<p>In advance of air travel, you are advised to contact your airline directly
and seek advice if you are unsure about any security issue, or if you wish to
carry certain goods. Knowing in advance which items you are forbidden to carry
on board an aircraft will ensure you can plan your baggage requirements
accordingly.</p>

<h2>Restrictions on liquids and security checkpoints<br></h2>

<p>There are restrictions in operation throughout the EU limiting the carriage
of liquids in carry-on hand luggage. You may only take small quantities of
liquids in hand luggage. Those liquids <strong>must be in individual
containers</strong> with a maximum capacity of 100ml each. The liquids
<strong>must be packed</strong> in one transparent, re-sealable plastic bag
that is not more than 1 litre in capacity. Liquids include the following items:
</p>
<ul><li>Water and other drinks, soups and syrups</li>
  <li>Gels (including hair and shower gels)</li>
  <li>Creams, lotions and oils</li>
  <li>Perfumes</li>
  <li>Pastes (including toothpaste)</li>
  <li>Mascara</li>
  <li>Pressurised containers (including shaving foam, other foams and
    deoderants)</li>
</ul><p>You may still pack liquids in luggage that you check in, the new
restrictions <em>only</em> apply to hand luggage. You may also carry in your
hand luggage any medicines and dietary requirements (including baby foods) for
use during the trip. Remember however, you may be asked for proof that they are
needed. </p>

<p>You may also buy liquids (such as drinks and perfumes) either in an EU shop
beyond the point where you show your boarding pass or on board an aircraft
operated by an EU airline. If these items are sold in a special sealed bag -
don't open it before you are screened, as the contents may be confiscated at
the checkpoint. The European Commission have produced these <a shape="rect" href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-06-363_en.htm?locale=en">Frequently
Asked Questions on the carriage of liquids as hand luggage</a>. </p>

<h3>Planning your baggage requirements</h3>
<ul><li>Ensure your bag is securely closed/fastened and if possible, locked </li>
  <li>Tie up loose straps and ensure no items are hanging from the bag - they
    may get caught in the baggage system </li>
  <li>Do not pack medication, important documents, valuable items or cash in
    your checked baggage - carry them instead in your unchecked/hand baggage.
    It is important to remember that airline liability is limited to US$400 per
    passenger for unchecked/hand baggage. If your unchecked/hand baggage
    contains items of greater value than this, you can sign a declaration and
    pay additional charges at check-in to cover any damage caused to your
    baggage. </li>
  <li>Label each bag on the inside with your name and full destination address
    and on the outside with your name and destination city </li>
  <li>Airlines have set varying levels of weight and dimensions (i.e., width,
    length, etc.) for checked and unchecked/hand luggage. You may have to pay
    additional charges if your luggage is greater than that specified by the
    airline. Check with the customer service department of the airline in
    advance of travel. </li>
</ul><h3>Identification</h3>

<p>Every piece of your checked baggage (i.e., baggage or luggage that you give
custody of to the airline when you check-in) must be clearly labelled with your
name and destination address. It is also advisable to place a similar label
inside each piece of baggage. (Sometimes, airlines provide these labels free of
charge when you check-in). </p>

<p>Remove all tags and labels left over from previous flights - they may cause
your baggage to be delayed or misplaced. </p>

<h3>Departure</h3>

<p>Before presenting your baggage at check-in, ensure it is locked. When it
accepted at the check-in desk, each item of checked and baggage will be given a
destination tag showing your flight number and a receipt portion will be
attached to your ticket. It is important to retain the receipt for your baggage
as this receipt has important information about your flight details, airline,
etc., and will help track your baggage if it is delayed or misplaced. </p>

<p>Ensure the tag shows the correct destination and flight number and, if you
are making connections en route, that your baggage is checked to your final
destination. </p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>Before boarding your flight, your hand baggage will be checked by security
staff using x-ray machinery. </p>

<p><span>Never carry packages with unidentified contents on behalf of other
people</span> and if you are asked to do so, contact the airport police,
customs or member of staff immediately. </p>

<p>Your checked baggage will be screened by security and matched against the
passenger list prior to loading. Airline liability could be reduced for both
checked and unchecked baggage if your baggage was presented at check-in, packed
in an unsuitable way (or packed in a damaged bag or case or if you presented
your baggage after the recommended check-in time). </p>

<h3>Restricted articles</h3>

<p>Your airline may carry some items of baggage with special precautions. There
may be an additional charge to carry these items and it is always advisable to
check with the airline in advance regarding arrangements you will need to make.
The following are some examples of restricted articles: </p>
<ul><li>Sports equipment (i.e., golf clubs, surf boards, snowboards, skis,
    bicycles, etc.) are permitted as checked baggage only </li>
  <li>Mobility aids (i.e., certain types of electric wheelchairs, walking
    frames, etc.) </li>
  <li>Musical instruments </li>
  <li>Guide dogs (some airlines will allow visually impaired passengers to
    travel with their guide dog once the animal is securely fastened and
    complies with quarantine requirements at your destination). </li>

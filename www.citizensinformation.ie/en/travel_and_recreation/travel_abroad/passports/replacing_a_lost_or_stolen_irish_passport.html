<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Your Irish passport is an important legal document. It is evidence of your
identity and that you are a citizen of Ireland and a citizen of the European
Union. Your Irish passport should always be kept in a safe place when you are
at home and when travelling abroad. </p>

<p>If your Irish passport is lost, mislaid or stolen and you wish to obtain
another, you can either <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/passportonline/">apply
online for a replacement</a> or use a paper application form.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You should be aware that:</p>
<ul><li>Any passport reported as lost or stolen is <strong>no longer a valid
    travel document</strong> and you should not try to travel on a passport
    which has been reported as lost or stolen. </li>
  <li>If you have a poor passport record, (that is, you have lost 2 or more
    passports) it is likely that a limited passport facility will be given to
    you for specific travel purposes. On each occasion on which a new passport
    is issued to you, (even when the passport is being issued for a limited
    time) you will have to pay the full cost of this passport. </li>
</ul><p>You should be aware that immigration requirements in some countries require
your passport to be valid for a certain amount of time before you can enter
another jurisdiction. </p>

<p>We are unable to include information on the passport validity requirements
for any particular country in the world. To get this information, contact your
air carrier/travel agent or the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=376">embassy/consulate of the
country to which you are travelling</a>. You should do this in good time before
you travel.</p>

<h3>Losing your Irish passport in Ireland</h3>

<p>If you are an Irish citizen living in Ireland and you have lost your Irish
passport, or it has been stolen, you must report the loss of your passport to
the Passport Office immediately. You will also need to report the loss or theft
to the Garda Síochána. You will be asked to confirm the loss in writing or,
if you are applying for a new passport, to include the details in your
application.</p>

<p>You can either <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/passportonline/">apply online for
a replacement</a> or on paper, (using form APS 1). You must give the
circumstances of the loss in Section 6 of the form. You can obtain an APS 1
form from <a shape="rect" href="http://www.garda.ie/Stations/Default.aspx">your
nearest Garda Station</a> or <a shape="rect" href="http://www.anpost.ie/AnPost/at+your+local+Post+Office.htm">Post
Office</a>. This form must be witnessed/countersigned by a member of An Garda
Síochána, who must also sign and stamp Section 6. </p>

<p>You must resubmit all the supporting documents required with a normal
first-time passport application to the Passport Office. These documents include
the full long form birth certificate, a marriage/civil partnership certificate
(if applicable) and 4 passport-sized photographs. You can read more about how
to apply for a passport in our document on <a shape="rect" href="applying_for_or_renewing_an_irish_passport.html">applying for your first
Irish passport</a>. </p>

<h3>Losing your Irish passport abroad</h3>

<p>If you are an Irish citizen currently living abroad, travelling or on
holiday abroad and your Irish passport is lost/stolen/misplaced, you must <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=285">contact your
nearest Irish embassy or consulate </a>immediately. You will be asked to
confirm the loss in writing or, if you are applying for a new passport, to
include the details in your application. (Applications for a new passport by
those living in Northern Ireland or outside Ireland are made online or using
form APS 2.) If you are currently in a country where there is no Irish
representation, you may contact an embassy/consulate of another EU Member State
who will contact the nearest Irish embassy on your behalf. </p>

<p>You must also get in touch with the local police and request a written
statement that you have reported the loss of your passport. A member of the
police authority in the country in which you are staying must witness this
statement. You will require this to obtain an <em>emergency travel
document</em> <em></em> from an Irish embassy or consulate. </p>

<p>Again, if you are currently in a country where there is no Irish
representation, you may contact an embassy or consulate of another EU Member
State. <span>The embassy or consulate of another EU Member State cannot issue
you with a replacement passport or an emergency travel document.</span> Instead
they will get in touch with the nearest Irish embassy or consulate on your
behalf, which will then get in touch with you. In some cases the embassy or
consulate of another EU Member State may issue you with an <a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/citizenship_of_the_union/l14010b_en.htm">EU
Emergency Travel Document (ETD)</a>.</p>

<h3>Emergency travel documents</h3>

<p> If you lose your passport abroad, an emergency travel document may be
issued by an Irish embassy or consulate.</p>

<p>In such circumstances, it is best to <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/embassies/irish-embassies-abroad">contact the nearest
Irish embassy or consulate</a> directly in order to find out what documents
will be required. </p>

<h3>Multi-stop journeys</h3>

<p>If you have lost your passport and are travelling abroad on a multi-stop
journey, where you will pass through more than one jurisdiction, you will
require <a href="renewing_an_irish_passport.html">a new Irish passport</a>.
You must report the loss of your passport immediately to your nearest Irish
embassy or consulate. If there is no Irish embassy or consulate in the country
where you are, contact an embassy of another EU Member State, which will get in
touch with the nearest Irish embassy on your behalf. An embassy of another EU
Member State cannot issue you with a new Irish passport. </p>

<p>You will be required to get in touch with the local police and request a
written statement that you have reported the loss of your passport. A member of
the police authority in the country in which you are staying must witness this
statement. It may be useful for you to carry a photocopy of your passport (data
page) with you when travelling.</p>

<div class="topic">

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>In the past, children could be included on a parent’s Irish passport.
However, since October 2004, a child – defined as aged under 18 – must have
an individual Irish passport in their own name.</p>

<p>Children’s passports last for 5 years. (Up to 29 March 2017, there was a
3-year passport for children aged under 3.)</p>

<h3>Applications</h3>

<p>An application for a passport for a child is made on form APS 1 if living in
the State, or form APS 2 if living in Northern Ireland or abroad. The child's
full birth certificate, showing the names of his/her parents, must be submitted
with the form. The application form includes a section for parental consent
which must be signed. What additional documentation needs to accompany the
application depends on a number of factors, including when and where the child
was born.</p>

<h3>Renewals</h3>

<p>An application to renew a passport for a child under 18 years of age must be
accompanied by the child's old passport. If the old passport was issued before
2005 you must also submit the child’s birth certificate. If you are renewing
a child’s passport which has been issued since January 2005, you do not need
to submit the birth certificate unless:</p>
<ul><li>The child’s birth has been re-registered since the old passport was
    issued or</li>
  <li>You are submitting a sole guardian affidavit or a court order</li>
</ul><p>If you are the sole guardian, you have to provide an up-to-date affidavit
(AFF 1) stating that you are the sole guardian each time you apply to renew
your child's passport – see 'Parental consent' below. </p>

<p>Application is made on form APS 1 or APS 2, as appropriate. Children’s
passports <strong>cannot</strong> be renewed online.</p>

<h3>Parental consent</h3>

<p>If you are or were married to the other parent of your child, and the other
parent is still alive, or if you are a joint guardian of the child, both
parents/guardians must sign the parental consent section (Section 7) of the
passport application form. If you are not in touch with your child's other
parent/guardian, or if that parent/guardian refuses to give consent, you can <a href="http://www.courts.ie/Courts.ie/Library3.nsf/PageCurrent/EE816A31E1F0A82B80257FB5004FB410?opendocument&amp;l=en">apply
to the District Court for a court order</a>, which will allow the Passport
Office to issue the passport without that consent.</p>

<p><strong>Sole guardian:</strong> The situation is different if you are the
sole guardian of a child. This can happen if you are a single mother and the
father has not arranged to <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/unmarried_couples/legal_guardianship_and_unmarried_couples.html">become
a joint guardian.</a> It also happens if the other parent/guardian is deceased.
If the father's name is on the child's birth certificate and he is willing to
sign, both of you can sign the parental consent section. Alternatively, instead
of the father signing the parental consent section, you will have to provide an
<a shape="rect" href="https://www.dfa.ie/media/dfa/alldfawebsitemedia/passportcitizenship/2013-sole-guardian-affidavit.pdf">affidavit
(AFF 1) stating that you are the sole guardian</a>. This should be completed in
the presence of a solicitor or <a href="../../../justice/civil_law/commissioners_for_oaths.html">Commissioner
for Oaths</a>. If the other parent/guardian is deceased, you will also have to
provide a death certificate. If a death certificate is not yet available as the
<a shape="rect" href="/en/death/sudden_or_unexplained_death/coroners.html">coroner
</a>has to hold an inquest into the death, you should provide an Interim
Certificate of the Fact of Death which is issued by the coroner.</p>

<p><strong>Babies born in the UK:</strong> If the birth was jointly registered
by both parents in Northern Ireland or Great Britain, the father may have joint
guardianship even if the parents never married.</p>

<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs has <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/passports-citizenship/top-passport-questions/consent-for-children/">more
information on parental consent</a> on its website.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l5af5e">Children born in Ireland</h2>

<h3>Children born before 1 January 2005</h3>

<p>The application for a passport must be accompanied by the child's full birth
certificate (and the child's old passport, if issued).</p>

<h3>Children born on or after 1 January 2005</h3>

<p>Where your child was born on or after 1 January 2005 on the island of
Ireland, your child's entitlement to a passport is determined by your or the
other parent's citizenship, or by your or the other parent's residence history
prior to the birth. Therefore, in addition to the child's full birth
certificate, other documentation must be supplied with the application as
evidence of this citizenship or residency.</p>

<p>Where <strong>a parent is an Irish citizen</strong>, or is entitled to be,
the full birth certificate or passport of that parent must be provided. </p>

<p>Where a <strong>parent is a British citizen</strong>, that parent's passport
is required.</p>

<p>Where a <strong>parent is a national of an EU/EEA Member State or
Switzerland</strong>, the parent must have resided in the island of Ireland for
a total of 3 or more years during the 4 years immediately before the birth.
That parent's passport, or national identity card, and <a shape="rect" href="https://www.dfa.ie/media/dfa/alldfawebsitemedia/passportcitizenship/Declaration-Form-A.pdf">Declaration
Form A (pdf)</a> must be provided. (<a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/si/0001.html">Declaration Form
B</a> is used by a guardian, or someone acting in loco parentis, where the
parent is unable to make the declaration.) As proof of that parent's residency
the following documents can be supplied:</p>
<ul><li>Tax records, including P60, P45 and P35L certificates</li>
  <li>Records of any social welfare benefits or a statement from the Department
    of Social Protection confirming that the parent received benefits and
    giving exact dates</li>
  <li>Other documents to fill any gaps in periods of residency, such as, pay
    slips, utility bills, an official rent/lease agreement, a rent book or bank
    statements showing local transactions</li>
</ul><p>The documents must be originals. Copies are not accepted.</p>

<p>Where a <strong>parent is not a national of an EU/EEA Member State or
Switzerland</strong>, the parent must have been lawfully resident in the island
of Ireland for a total of 3 or more years during the 4 years immediately before
the birth. (This does not include periods awaiting a decision on refugee status
or residency granted specifically for the purpose of study.) The following must
be provided:</p>
<ul><li>That parent's passport as well as a detailed note indicating which pages
    contain immigration stamps covering the reckonable periods of residence. If
    the passport office is unable to confirm the required three years residence
    from the passport, the parent will have to get a letter from the Garda
    National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) to confirm the reckonable periods of
    residence. </li>
  <li>That parent's registration card issued by the GNIB. </li>
</ul><p>Where a <strong>parent has been granted refugee status</strong> prior to the
birth, there is <em>no</em> 3-year residency requirement. The following must be
provided:</p>
<ul><li>That parent's passport or travel document </li>
  <li>The letter from the Department of Justice and Equality notifying that
    parent that refugee status had been granted </li>
  <li>That parent's registration card issued by the GNIB (if available) </li>
</ul><p>Where a <strong>parent has permission to reside in Northern Ireland</strong>
without any time restriction and that parent is not a national of an EU/EEA
Member State or Switzerland, a certificate of nationality in respect of the
child must first be obtained from the Department of Justice and Equality. The
certificate and that parent's passport must be provided.</p>

<p>To obtain a certificate of nationality, that parent must complete <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Form%20C%20(Ver%203.0%20Jan%202014).pdf/Files/Form%20C%20(Ver%203.0%20Jan%202014).pdf">Declaration
Form C (pdf)</a> which can be obtained from the Department of Justice and
Equality. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/si/0001.html">(Declaration Form
D</a> is used by a guardian, or somone acting in loco parentis, where the
parent is unable to make the declaration.)</p>

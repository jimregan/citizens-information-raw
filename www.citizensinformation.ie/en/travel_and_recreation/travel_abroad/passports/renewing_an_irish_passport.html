<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>A passport is an internationally recognised travel document confirming your
identity and nationality and you are only entitled to an Irish passport if you
are <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/irish_citizenship/your_right_to_irish_citizenship.html">an
Irish citizen</a>. This document explains how to renew your Irish passport when
you have your old Irish passport. Since 30 March 2017, it is possible to do
this online.</p>

<p>In other documents you will find information on:</p>
<ul><li><a href="applying_for_or_renewing_an_irish_passport.html">Applying for
    your first Irish passport</a></li>
  <li><a href="passports_for_children.html">Passports for children</a></li>
  <li><a href="replacing_a_lost_or_stolen_irish_passport.html">Replacing a
    lost or stolen passport</a></li>
  <li><a href="irish_passport_card.html">Irish Passport Card</a></li>
</ul><p>If your most recent passport expired more than 5 years ago, you should read
the document on applying for your first Irish passport.</p>

<p>Your passport is an important legal document. At all times, you should
ensure that it is kept in a secure place. Each Irish passport carries a unique
identification number and you should keep a note of your number, in the event
that your passport is lost or stolen. </p>

<p>Your Irish passport is issued by the Irish Government through the Passport
Service of the <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/">Department of Foreign Affairs and
Trade</a> here in Ireland. Irish passports are also issued through Irish
embassies and consulates throughout the world, to whom you apply if you are
living abroad. </p>

<h3>Validity of Irish passports</h3>

<p>Irish citizens travelling to destinations outside the EU are subject to the
specific passport controls and requirements of those countries. This means, for
example, when travelling outside the EU, your passport may need to be valid for
a certain period. The arrangements vary from one country to another, so contact
the <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=376">embassy of the relevant
country</a> before you travel for the most up-to-date information on these
requirements. </p>

<p>All EU citizens have the right to enter and live in the territory of another
member state of the EU for up to 3 months. You simply present a valid passport
or national identity card; no other formality is required. EU countries cannot
set additional conditions concerning the minimum validity or duration of the
identity card or passport. Basically this means that your passport doesn't have
to be valid for, say, 6 months before you are allowed enter another EU
country.</p>

<h3>Machine-readable passports</h3>

<p>A machine-readable passport is a passport with 2 typeface lines printed at
the bottom of the biographical page [the photo page], which can be read by
machine. When read, these lines electronically provide identical information to
that provided on the biographical page. </p>

<h3>Electronic passports (ePassports)</h3>

<p>In October 2006 the Passport Office began issuing Irish electronic passports
(ePassport). An electronic passport is the same as a normal machine-readable
passport with the addition of a small integrated circuit or <em>chip</em>
embedded in the photo page. The chip securely stores a digitised image of the
photo and personal details of the passport holder as they appear on the data
page of the passport, which allows the use of facial recognition technology at
border controls. </p>

<h3>Renewal reminder</h3>

<p>You can renew your passport at any time. If you apply for a new passport
before your current one has expired, your new passport will run from when you
apply.</p>

<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provides a <a href="https://www.eforms.gov.ie/en/reminder/passport/">Passport Reminder
Service</a> which sends you a reminder by email 3 months before your passport
is due to expire. You must register for this service.</p>

<h3>Change of name</h3>

<p>If you want to change the name on your passport, for example, if you have
married, you have to renew your passport.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You <strong>must be an Irish citizen</strong> in order to be eligible for an
Irish passport.</p>

<p>You have a right to apply for a passport if you are aged 18 years or over.
If you are under 18, you will need the consent of both parents or guardian(s)
in writing in order to get your own passport - see <a href="passports_for_children.html">our document on passports for
children</a>. </p>

<h3>Name on passport</h3>

<p>Titles such as Mr, Mrs, Ms, Dr, Rev., Sir, Lord, Lady are not entered on
Irish passports.</p>

<p>If the name on your passport will not be exactly the same as the name on
your birth certificate, you can indicate on the application form that you also
want your birth certificate name noted on the passport. This can help to avoid
difficulties if you apply for a visa or work permit abroad. </p>

<h3>Passport photographs</h3>

<p>If you are applying online, you will need to provide a digital photo. There
are 3 ways to do this – see <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/passportonline/onlinephotoguidelines/">these detailed
photo guidelines</a> on dfa.ie. </p>

<p>For each paper application, 4 recent identical photographs of the passport
holder must be included. Two of these should be signed on the back by the <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/passports-citizenship/top-passport-questions/how-to-get-your-application-witnessed/">person
who witnesses the application</a>. The witness should also write the form
number shown in Section 9 of the application form on those 2 photographs. If
you are applying in Ireland the witness must be a member of the Garda
Síochána. </p>

<p>If you are applying abroad, suitable categories of witness are listed on the
application form. The witness should enter their daytime contact number on the
application form as this may need to be verified by the Passport Office or
Mission.</p>

<p>More <a shape="rect" href="https://www.dfa.ie/passports-citizenship/top-passport-questions/photo-guidelines/">detailed
information on passport photographs is available here</a>. </p>

<p>When you get the form, you should read the detailed notes provided with it,
to help you complete your application correctly. The application form must be
signed by an official witness who can confirm your identity and the details you
have given.</p>

<h3>Documentation required</h3>

<p>If you are renewing your Irish passport online, you will need to provide a
digital photo of yourself - see <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/passportonline/onlinephotoguidelines/">these detailed
photo guidelines</a> on dfa.ie. </p>

<p>In all paper applications to renew your Irish passport, as well as the
completed application form, you must submit:</p>
<ul><li>Four photographs, 2 of which must be signed by a witness as per
    instructions provided with the application form</li>
  <li>Your current or most recent passport. If your current passport is valid
    for less than 6 more months, a copy of the passport will be accepted. (If
    you are renewing your passport and making no changes, you need only submit
    your most recent Irish passport)</li>
  <li>The appropriate fee</li>
</ul><p>If you are renewing a child’s passport which has been issued since January
2005, you may not need to submit the child's birth certificate. Find out more
in our document on <a href="passports_for_children.html">passports for
children</a>.</p>

<h3>Additional documentation</h3>

<p>If you want to change the name on your passport to your married or civil
partnership name you must submit your civil marriage certificate or civil
partnership certificate.</p>

<p>If your previous passport was issued in your married name and you want your
new passport issued in your maiden name you must submit your birth certificate
and your judicial separation court order, your separation agreement or your
divorce decree. Otherwise, you will need to submit 2 official documents that
show you've been using your maiden name for 2 years.</p>

<p>If the name you are known by is different from the name on your most recent
passport and it is not due to marriage, civil partnership or adoption, you will
have to submit documentary evidence that you have been continually using the
name for at least 2 years. If the name you are known by is the Irish version of
your name but you do not have proof of 2 years’ usage, proof of at least 6
months’ usage may be accepted. If the proof of 6 months’ usage is accepted,
the English version of your name will also be noted on the passport. Examples
of documentation showing proof of usage include a driving licence, bank
statements, insurance, tax and social welfare documents. You should include at
least 2 examples with your application.</p>

<p>If your documents are not in English you must also supply a certified
English version, translated by a <a href="http://www.translatorsassociation.ie/">registered translator</a>.</p>

<h3>Processing times for Irish passports</h3>

<p>The Passport Service strongly recommends that you apply for your passport at
least 6 weeks prior to your travel date.</p>

<p>Applying through the Passport Express service ensures that properly
completed renewal applications will be processed in 15 working days. This
period may be extended at certain times of the year due to increased
application numbers. Check the Passport Service website for <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/passporttracking/turnaroundtimes/">current processing
time information</a>.</p>

<p>If you are due to travel in less than 3 weeks you should apply in person to
a Passport Office. To apply in person at a Passport Office, you should <a href="https://www.passportappointments.ie/">book an appointment online</a>. </p>

<p>If you require a passport urgently, you should contact the Passport Service.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>If living abroad, in general you should allow at least 6-8 weeks for the
processing of your passport via your local embassy or consulate.</p>

<h3>Tracking the progress of your passport application </h3>

<p>The Passport Service provides a <a shape="rect" href="https://www.dfa.ie/passports-citizenship/track-your-passport/">Passport
Tracking Service</a>. This service allows you to check the status of your
application online. In order to do this, you must have the application number
from your form (available in the top left-hand corner of the form) to do
this.</p>

<h3>Pilot Rapid Renewal Service</h3>

<p>A Pilot Rapid Renewal Service has been introduced in the Dublin Passport
Office for adults and children who are renewing their passport and who are
travelling in less than 3 working days. You can make an appointment for the
Rapid Renewal Service at <a href="https://www.passportappointments.ie/">passportappointments.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>Emergency travel documents</h3>

<p>In cases of genuine emergency, the duty officer at the Department of Foreign
Affairs and Trade can issue an <em>emergency travel document</em> of limited
validity. Examples of such emergencies are: </p>
<ul><li>Situations of substantial distress such as the deaths or funerals of
    immediate family members abroad </li>
  <li>Urgent medical attention abroad </li>
</ul><p>It is not possible for an emergency travel document to issue to minors
(except in extremely limited circumstances), to first time applicants or in
cases that do not involve a medical emergency or family bereavement. </p>

<p>There is a charge of €110 for this out-of-hours emergency service.</p>

<p>Emergency travel documents may also be issued by Irish embassies or
consulates, to <a href="replacing_a_lost_or_stolen_irish_passport.html">replace a passport
that is lost or stolen</a> abroad.</p>

<h3>Signing the passport</h3>

<p>When you receive your passport, you should sign it. In the case of a
child’s passport, the child should sign it. If the child is not able to sign
their name, it should be left blank.</p>

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l07de2">Introduction </h2>

<p>The following information explains how to apply for a European Health
Insurance Card (EHIC) if you are living in Ireland or living in another EU/EEA
State and are linked to the Irish Social Security System. If you live in
Ireland but you are linked to another EU/EEA State's Social Security System,
contact the health authorities in that country for more information. </p>

<p>If you are an EU/EEA national and are travelling or staying temporarily in
another state of the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, you are
entitled to receive medical care if you become ill or have an accident.</p>

<p>If you are a student or a seconded worker, or if you are entitled to a
social security pension in that state, you will be entitled to health care
beyond the immediate treatment.</p>

<p>The <span>European Health Insurance Card</span> (EHIC) replaced the E111
form and a number of other 'E' forms including the E128, making it easier for
you to get medical care quickly and easily. It is evidence that you are part of
a health insurance scheme administered by another state in the EEA/Switzerland.
To obtain healthcare with the Card, you can go to the nearest public system
doctor, public hospital, or other public treatment centre and present your
Card.</p>

<p>Public health care systems vary from country to country, and few countries
pay the full cost of health care for holders of the Card, so there may be some
element of co-payment for the services you receive.</p>

<p>Currently, the EEA comprises the 28 member states of the European Union
together with Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. Your European Health Insurance
Card is valid for use throughout any of these countries and in Switzerland. </p>

<h3>Where can I use my European Health Insurance Card?</h3>

<p>In any EU/EEA Country and in Switzerland. Follow this link to find out <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/EHIC/othercountries/Healthcare_services_in_other_EU_EEA_countries.html">where
you can use your Card and how to access care abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If the <span>country</span> you are visiting is <span>not among those
listed</span>, you <span>cannot use a European Health Insurance Card</span>
there and you should obtain <span>private health insurance instead</span>.</p>

<p><span>Andorra and Monaco</span> are <span>not part of the EU</span> (they
are separate principalities). As they are not part of the EU, they are not
subject to EU regulations and <span>your European Health Insurance Card is not
acceptable</span> there. You are advised to <span>obtain private health
insurance</span> instead.</p>

<h3>Can non-EU nationals apply for and use European Health Insurance Cards?</h3>

<p>Under <a shape="rect" href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/other/l33197_en.htm">Regulation
859/2003</a> any non-EU national, their family members or survivors legally
resident in the territory of an EU member state may apply for and use a
European Health Insurance Card or Temporary Replacement Certificate while on
temporary visits between member states. However, they cannot use their card for
medical treatment in Denmark, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You can only apply for an European Health Insurance Card from the Irish
health authorities if you are:</p>
<ul><li>Ordinarily resident in Ireland and you are not receiving a Social
    Insurance payment from another EU State or paying another EU State's Social
    Insurance, or you are not the dependant of such a person. </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/EHIC/ehicotherstates.html">Resident
    in another EU State</a> and you are receiving an Irish Social Insurance
    payment or paying Irish Social Insurance, or you are a dependant of such a
    person. </li>
</ul><p>Like the old E111, the European Health Insurance Card only entitles you to
the state-funded health care scheme in the country in which you are staying. It
will not cover any of the costs involved in transporting you back to Ireland.
</p>

<p>Every <span>individual member of the family or group</span> will
<span>require their own card</span>. </p>

<p>Each European Health Insurance Card will be valid throughout the EEA and
Switzerland for up to 4 years. </p>

<p>You can get a European Health Insurance Card in Ireland <span>if </span>you
are <span>ordinarily resident here</span>. </p>

<p>The European Health Insurance Card will not cover you for health care in any
country outside the EEA, with the exception of Switzerland. </p>

<p>You don’t need a European Health Insurance Card to get necessary health
care while on a temporary visit to the UK if you are an Irish resident. It is
enough to show proof that you are ordinarily resident in Ireland. (In practice,
proof that you are ordinarily resident in Ireland means a driving licence,
Irish passport or similar document.)</p>

<h3>What is 'necessary health care' for the purposes of using my European
Health Insurance Card?</h3>

<p>The term 'necessary care' was defined under decision 194 of 2003 by the
Administrative Commission on Social Security for Migrant Workers. That decision
defines necessary care as benefits granted with a view to preventing an insured
person from being forced to return home to their home member state and enabling
them to continue their temporary stay in another member state under safe
medical conditions. The decision specifically states that it does not cover
persons who travel within Europe in order to obtain treatment in a country
other than that in which they are insured.</p>

<p>There is <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/EHIC/Terms_Conditions.html">further
information regarding the rights and obligations of those who hold and use a
European Health Insurance Card</a> here.</p>

<h3>How do I renew my European Health Insurance Card?</h3>

<p>Your Card <span>will not be renewed automatically</span> - instead, you must
apply to renew your Card. See 'How to apply' below for instructions. </p>

<p>Remember, if any of your details have changed (e.g. address, etc.) since
your last card was issued you must contact your Local Health Office to have
this information updated in advance of renewal. </p>

<h3>What if I don't have my Card before I travel?</h3>

<p>If you don't have your European Health Insurance Card for any reason, you
can get a Temporary Replacement Certificate. This Certificate gives you the
same entitlement as the Card, but for a shorter period. You can apply online
for this Certificate, or by post or in person to your Local Health Office. (See
'Where to apply' below). One Temporary Replacement Certificate is issued per
person.</p>

<h3>Using a European Health Insurance Card in Ireland</h3>

<p>There are more than 2,000 family doctors (GPs) in Ireland contracted to the
European Health Insurance Card scheme. If you are an EU/EEA national with a
European Health Insurance Card (or equivalent) visiting Ireland you can avail
of necessary family doctor services and emergency dental treatment for the
relief of pain (and urgent denture repairs) under EU regulations. Emergency
services in Ireland are contactable by telephoning 999 or 112, free of charge.
Further information about <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/EHIC/visitors/">how to
obtain treatment from a family doctor or dentist, prescription medicines and
hospital treatment while visiting Ireland</a> is available here.</p>

Replacement Certificate. Renewing a European Health Insurance Card is also
free.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<h3>Applying for a European Health Insurance Card for the first time</h3>

<p>If you are travelling to an EU/EEA country or Switzerland you should apply
for an European Health Insurance Card (or Temporary Replacement Certificate) in
advance of travel.</p>

<p>You may <a shape="rect" href="https://www.sspcrs.ie/ehic/e111info.jsp">apply
online for your European Health Insurance Card</a> <span>if you are currently
resident in Ireland</span> and you already have either a <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical
card</a> or a <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/drugs_payment_scheme.html">Drugs
Payment Scheme</a> (DPS) card. Your online application will be forwarded to the
<a shape="rect" href="/en/health/health_service_agencies/general_medical_services_payments_board.html">HSE
Primary Care Re-imbursement Service)</a> for processing. Your Card or
Certificate will then be posted out to you. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/EHIC/EHIC_Application_Form.pdf">download
a European Health Insurance Card application form here (pdf)</a>. If you are
applying for a Temporary Replacement Certificate, write 'Temporary Replacement
Certificate' on the form.</p>

<p>Complete the form and <span>return it to your Local Health Office</span>
<span>at least 1 month before you leave Ireland</span>. </p>

<p>Copies of the application form for a European Health Insurance Card are also
available from your Local Health Office.</p>

<p>If you are resident in another EU/EEA member state, a different application
form is used. You can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/EHIC/ehicotherstates.html">apply
online or download the form</a> and email or post it.</p>

<h3>Renewing an expired European Health Insurance Card</h3>

<p>European Health Insurance Cards are not re-issued automatically when they
expire. Instead, you must apply to renew your Card. Before you apply to renew
your expired Card online, <span>remember to have your old Card to hand</span>.
If you have changed address or your name since your last Card was issued you
will need to contact <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/EHIC/contactdetails/">your
Local Health Office</a>. It is advisable to apply well in advance of the date
you plan to travel.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="https://www.sspcrs.ie/portal/ehic/">Renew your

<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l9df5e">Refund of health costs</h2>

<p>The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) entitles you to healthcare through
the public system if you become ill or injured while on a temporary stay. In
some states you may have to make some payment towards the cost of the services
you receive, just as residents in that state do. Such payments are
non-refundable. If you avail of private health care no refund is payable.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to a refund if you were charged because you did not
present a valid EHIC or you were charged in error by the health service
provider in the other state.</p>

<p>You should apply for a refund to your HSE Local Health Office. You should
bring any receipts you have. The HSE will send an E126 form to the health
authorities in the other state to establish:</p>
<ul><li>If you availed of a public health service</li>
  <li>The level of refund that is due to you</li>
</ul><p>On return of the completed E126 form from the other state, the HSE should be
able to determine if a refund is due or not. Further information is available
on the <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/E126/">HSE
website</a>.</p>

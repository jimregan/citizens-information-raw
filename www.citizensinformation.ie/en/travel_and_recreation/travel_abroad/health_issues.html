<p>More and more Irish citizens are travelling internationally for
professional, recreational, social and humanitarian reasons. Given we are
travelling greater distances and to a wide variety of countries, sometimes this
can expose our health to risks in often unfamiliar environments. Hopefully,
your trip abroad will be free of any health scares, but you need to be prepared
to meet every eventuality. </p>

<p>Most of the health risks associated with travel, can be minimized by
suitable precautions taken before, during and after your trip. You should
ensure that you have taken every possible precaution and, if the worst comes to
the worst, you should be confident that you have organised the necessary
insurance to pay for the medical care you require.</p>

<p>Some key factors in determining risks to your health when travelling abroad
include:</p>
<ul><li>destination you are visiting </li>
  <li>duration of your visit </li>
  <li>purpose of visit </li>
  <li>standards of accommodation </li>
  <li>food hygiene, and </li>
  <li>behaviour of the traveller </li>
</ul><h3>Medical advice before you travel</h3>

<p>If you are intending to visit somewhere in a developing country, you should
consult with your family doctor (GP) or a travel medicine clinic before the
journey. This consultation should preferably take place about 8 weeks before
the journey, particularly if vaccination(s) may be required. Your family doctor
or clinic can advise you on this. </p>

<p>Similarly, if you have a pre-existing medical condition that requires
ongoing care, or are among an 'at risk' group it is advisable to seek medical
advice in advance of your journey. </p>

<p>If you will be travelling abroad for an extended period, you should consider
consulting your doctor to discuss known or possible health risks. If you take
medication on a regular basis you should ask your doctor to prescribe an amount
adequate for your visit and bring it with you. It is also advisable to bring a
letter from your doctor outlining your medical condition and the type of
medication you require.</p>

<h3>Vaccinations and immunisations</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="vaccinations_health_tips.html">Vaccinations and
immunisations</a> are required in order to travel to certain countries around
the world. They should be considered if you are travelling to areas outside of
Western Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. Your family doctor
(GP) or travel medicine clinic can advise on your options. </p>

<h3>Travelling within the EU/EEA</h3>

<p>If you are a EU/EEA citizen and your trip is to a destination within the EEA
(the 28 EU member states, Norway Iceland, Liechtenstein) or Switzerland, you
are <span>strongly advised</span> to bring along your <a shape="rect" href="e111.html">European Health Insurance Card</a>. This Card will cover the
cost associated with necessary medical treatment (if required) while you are
visiting another member state. </p>

<h3>Travelling outside the EU/EEA </h3>

<p>If you will be travelling outside the EU/EEA, you are strongly advised to
seek specific <a href="http://www.nca.ie/nca/travel-insurance">holiday or
health insurance</a> before you travel. Insurance rates in Ireland can vary
significantly, so <span>shop around for the best value</span> before your
trip.</p>

<p><a href="http://health.gov.ie/blog/press-release/reciprocal-agreement-on-medical-treatment-for-temporary-visitors-between-ireland-and-australia/">Ireland
and Australia have a reciprocal health agreement</a>. This means that Irish
visitors to Australia will receive emergency services and assistance towards
the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines on the same basis as persons
ordinarily resident in Australia. </p>

<h3>Insect bites</h3>

<p>Depending on what part of the world you are in, insects such as mosquitoes,
ticks and sandflies can spread infections such as malaria and yellow fever. The
HSE website provides information on <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/health/az/B/Bites,-insect/Preventing-insect-bites.html">how
to prevent insect bites</a>. </p>

<h3>Avoiding illness</h3>

<p>The HSE has information on <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/health/az/T/Travel-health/Preventing-illness-and-infection-while-abroad.html">preventing
illness and infection while abroad</a>.</p>

<p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre provides <a href="http://www.hpsc.ie/hpsc/A-Z/Vectorborne/TravelAdviceforInternationalTravellers/Factsheet/">advice
for travellers on how to avoid illness</a> on its website. </p>

<p>The World Health Organization has provided a very useful site with lots of
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.who.int/ith/en/">information and advice
regarding health and international travel.</a> </p>

<h3>A checklist for travellers</h3>

<p>A little time spent checking out the following information before your trip
will also ensure you are well prepared.</p>
<ul><li>What local conditions do I need to be aware of? </li>
  <li>Do I need vaccines to prevent illness or health risks? </li>
  <li>Which authorities do I contact in the event of an accident or incident?
  </li>
  <li>Do I need any additional medical prescriptions before I travel? </li>
  <li>What blood group am I? </li>
  <li>Do I need a dental/optical/medical check-up before I travel? </li>
</ul><p>Your family doctor (GP) or tropical medical bureau can answer some of the
above questions. It's also sensible (depending on your destination) to check
with your dentist/optician whether you may need a check-up before you travel.
</p>

<p>Your travel agent/tour operator/trip organiser should be able to provide
information on the local weather, accommodation, health facilities and other
conditions before your journey. Travel guidebooks are also a good source of
information. You can also get in touch with the nearest Embassy or Consulate of
the country you will be visiting for more information. </p>

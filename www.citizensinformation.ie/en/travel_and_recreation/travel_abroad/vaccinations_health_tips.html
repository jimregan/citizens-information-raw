<h3>Before you go</h3>

<p>If you normally live in Ireland and are travelling abroad, you should check
whether you require vaccinations in order to travel to the country or countries
you intend to visit. Vaccines should be considered if you are travelling to
areas outside of Western Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand.
Health risks vary from country to country, so seek advice from your family
doctor (<a shape="rect" href="../../health/gp_and_hospital_services/">GP</a>),
<a shape="rect" href="/en/health/how_health_is_organised/health_boards.html">Health Service
Executive (HSE)</a> or travel agent in advance of travel. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.who.int/countries/en/">World Health
Organisation Country List</a> provides some information.</p>

<p>Start the process of vaccination well before you plan to travel. Some
vaccinations take time to become effective so give yourself at least 8 weeks to
protect yourself fully. An early start to the process is particularly important
if you plan to travel with children. The BCG vaccination against tuberculosis
(TB), for example, should be given at least 3 months before your child
travels.</p>

<p>The HSE has information on the <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/health/az/T/Travel-vaccinations/Vaccinations-for-conditions-starting-with-A-M.html">different
types of vaccines</a>, such as for cholera or for tuberculosis, on its
website.</p>

<p>Certain vaccinations are compulsory. In these cases, you will need to show
an International Certificate of Vaccination in order to gain access to the
country in question. Other vaccinations are recommended and the decision is
left to your own discretion, however, it makes sense to do everything you can
to guard against illness and disease while you are away. </p>

<h3>When you return</h3>

<p>If you feel ill following your return to Ireland, make sure that you see a
doctor as soon as possible. Give full details of the countries you visited, in
case this should be relevant.</p>

<h4>Notifiable infectious diseases</h4>

<p>The law in Ireland makes special provision regarding the reporting of
infectious diseases to the national <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hpsc.ie">Health Protection Surveillance Centre</a>. As soon as
a medical practitioner in Ireland becomes aware of, or suspects that a person
they are attending is suffering from, or is the carrier of an infectious
disease, they are required to transmit a written or electronic notification to
a Medical Officer of Health. Notification of infectious diseases is necessary
in order to control infectious diseases. Ireland's Health Protection
Surveillance Centre works in partnership with health service providers and
organisations in other countries to ensure that up to date information is
available to contribute to the effective control of infectious diseases.</p>

<h3>Compulsory vaccinations</h3>

<p>You will not need vaccinations in order to visit any European country,
unless you have visited a non-European country shortly beforehand. </p>

<p>Make sure that you record your vaccinations on an International Vaccination
Certificate.</p>

<p><span>Travel vaccinations are not free in Ireland</span> through the public
health system - even if you hold a medical card. You will have to pay the full
cost for vaccinations. </p>

<p>A charge will usually be made for your visit to the doctor and in addition,
you will have to pay for each vaccine or set of tablets prescribed.</p>

<p>Travelling abroad can be a very worthwhile and rewarding experience. Whether
it's your first time to leave Ireland or you are a seasoned traveller, there
are a numer of things you need to consider when you are preparing for travel
abroad. </p>

<h3>Before you travel abroad</h3>

<p>Before you travel, familiarise yourself with your destination. Do you
require a visa to travel there? What is the local currency? Is there a time
difference between your destination and Ireland? You can obtain all this
information from your travel agent or the <a href="http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=376">embassy of the country</a>
concerned in advance. Alternatively, you can also <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=386">search for this information
online</a>. Irish citizens travelling abroad should <a href="http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=40332">register their contact
details</a> with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, particularly if
they are travelling to remote destinations or locations where they may be at
risk.</p>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p>With the exception of travel to the UK, Irish citizens require a valid
passport in order to travel to every destination. However, your airline or
ferry company will probably require you to have a valid passport.</p>

<p>All EU citizens have the right to enter and reside in the territory of any
other member state of the European Union for a period of up to three months
simply by presenting a valid passport or national identity card; no other
formality is required. Member states cannot set additional conditions
concerning the minimum validity of duration of the identity card or
passport.</p>

<p>Irish citizens travelling to destinations outside the EU are subject to the
specific passport controls and requirements of those countries. This means, for
example, when travelling outside the EU, your passport may need to be valid for
a certain period. Remember, you can <a href="passports/renewing_an_irish_passport.html">renew your Irish
passport</a> at any time - you don't have to wait until your passport is about
to expire to do so. Read more information on applying for a passport in our
document on <a shape="rect" href="passports/applying_for_or_renewing_an_irish_passport.html">applying for
an Irish passport</a>. </p>

<p>Irish passport holders require an <a href="https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/">electronic travel authorization
(ESTA)</a> before boarding their flight to the US. </p>

<h3>Visas</h3>

<p>Whether or not you will require a visa when travelling abroad depends on
your destination. Your travel agent or the embassy of the country you will be
visiting can advise on this. </p>

<h3>Health</h3>

<p>If you are travelling to a destination within the EU, you are entitled to
receive emergency medical treatment on the same basis as a national of that
country. You <span>must have your <a href="e111.html">European Health
Insurance Card</a> with you.</span> </p>

<p>If you will be travelling abroad for an extended period, you should consider
consulting your doctor to discuss known or possible health risks. This is
particularly important if you have an existing medical condition or are
visiting a tropical area where the conditions exist for the spread of
infectious diseases. There is more information in our document on <a href="health_issues.html">health issues when travelling abroad</a>. </p>

<h3>Money </h3>

<p>Generally speaking, international credit cards and debit cards are the
safest way to carry funds when travelling abroad. In more remote areas,
however, you may not be able to use them. Again, check with your travel agent
prior to departure about the best way to carry funds. It is advisable always to
carry a small amount of local currency to pay bus or taxi fares or make small
purchases or telephone calls. </p>

<p>Before you leave Ireland, make a note of the 24-hour emergency number of the
bank that issued your credit card/debit card so you can cancel it in the event
it is stolen.</p>

<h3>Driving abroad</h3>

<p>If you intend to drive while abroad, make sure that your <a href="../motoring_1/driver_licensing/full_driving_licence.html">Irish
driving licence</a> is valid and that you bring it with you. Some countries
outside the European Economic Area (the member states of the European Union,
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) may require you to hold an <a href="../motoring_1/driver_licensing/international_driving_permit.html">International
Driving Permit</a> in addition to your Irish driving licence. </p>

<p>Always make sure you are properly insured for driving while overseas.</p>

<h3>Electrical equipment</h3>

<p>Electrical plugs and sockets in other countries will be different from those
in use in Ireland. You may need special adapters to enable you to use
electrical appliances you bring from Ireland (such as hair dryers, shavers,
etc.). You can purchase these adapters at airports and in many stores here in
Ireland. </p>

<h3>Mobile telephone</h3>

<p>If you are taking a mobile telephone with you, check in advance that it will
work in the country to which you are travelling. Roaming charges can be very
high and this can make the cost of using an Irish mobile phone abroad very
expensive. A <a href="http://www.askcomreg.ie/mobile/eurotraiff.251.LE.asp">price limit called
a Eurotariff</a> places a cap on the price you can be charged for using your
mobile phone while travelling in the EU. Contact your service provider for more
information on the costs of making and receiving calls abroad. </p>

<h3>Travel warnings</h3>

<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Ireland provide <a href="http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=276">travel advice to Irish people
planning a trip overseas</a>. This advice reflects a considered <a href="http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=275">assessment of the risks
involved for Irish citizens travelling to individual countries</a>. </p>

<h3>While you are abroad</h3>

<p>Make a note of the address, telephone number and opening hours of the <a href="http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=285">Irish Embassy or Consulate</a>
in the country you are visiting. In countries where there is no Irish
diplomatic or consular representation, you may seek emergency assistance from
embassies or consulates of other European Union countries. </p>

<p>It's always advisable when travelling outside Ireland to plan your travels
in advance. This will save considerable time when you get there and will help
make your time abroad a positive experience. Remember to let family and friends
in Ireland know where you are and when they can expect to hear from you. This
will mean that they can also contact you in case there is an emergency. </p>

<p>On its website, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provides advice
on what to do to <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/travel/know-before-you-go/safety-and-security/">stay
safe while abroad</a> and <a href="http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=277">what to do in an emergency</a>.
The Department has also developed a <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/news-and-media/press-releases/press-release-archive/2016/june/minister-flanagan-launches-travelwise/">free
smartphone app called TravelWise</a> which has travel advice and consular
information on 200 countries. The app is available from the Apple and Android
stores.</p>

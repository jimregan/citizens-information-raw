<p>Travelling abroad with children can be an extremely rewarding experience.
Visiting other countries and experiencing different cultures can be a wonderful
educational opportunity. It is important, however, to consider in advance
whether the destination will suit all the members of your family, including
children. Very small children (less than 18 months) really will be unaware of
the holiday destination and so in most cases, they would prefer to be at home
in familiar surroundings. </p>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p>Since October 2004 all children, regardless of age, must obtain an
individual Irish passport in their own name. You should ensure in advance of
travel that all passports are in date with at least six months to their expiry
date. </p>

<p>See our document on <a shape="rect" href="passports/passports_for_children.html">passports for children</a> for
further information. </p>

<h3>Travelling with someone else’s child</h3>

<p>If you are travelling with someone else’s child or with a child with a
different surname, you may have to explain the relationship between you and the
child to immigration officers in the country you are travelling to. If you are
travelling alone with your child, you may have to provide evidence that you
have the other parent’s consent to travel. You can find advice on the type of
documentation you should bring with you in these situations on the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/travel-with-children">Irish
Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) website</a>.</p>

<h3>Vaccinations and health</h3>

<p>You should seek information and advice from your family doctor (GP) if you
will be travelling outside Western Europe, North America, Australia or New
Zealand, as <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/health/az/T/Travel-vaccinations/Introduction.html">vaccinations</a>
may be compulsory or highly advisable when visiting some countries. If <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/health/az/M/Malaria/Introduction.html">malaria</a>
is a risk in the destination you plan to visit, then everyone including
children should take <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/health/az/M/Malaria/Preventing-malaria.html">appropriate
precautions</a>. </p>

<p>If your child has a history of illness at home, be prepared for a
reoccurrence while abroad. Seek advice from your doctor in advance of travel
and consider bringing an emergency supply of medication. If you plan to travel
within the EU, you should get a <a shape="rect" href="e111.html">European
Health Insurance Card</a> for each person travelling before you leave Ireland
as this will entitle you to emergency treatment in another EU country while
abroad. </p>

<h3>Sun exposure</h3>

<p>Children (especially infants) can be very sensitive to the sun and <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/health/az/S/Sunburn/Introduction.html">sunburn</a>
is a common cause of discomfort. <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/health/az/H/Heat-exhaustion-and-heatstroke/Introduction.html">Heatstroke</a>
can occur as a result of very hot temperatures, extreme physical exertion or
sunburn. Seek advice from your pharmacy or doctor before you travel about using
high factor lotions, creams and sunblock and remember to take <a href="http://www.cancer.ie/reduce-your-risk/sunsmart/protect-your-children">sensible
precautions</a> and keep children covered up. </p>

<h3>Food and water</h3>

<p>Trying out new food is part of the experience while travelling abroad but
taking <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hpsc.ie/hpsc/A-Z/Vectorborne/TravelAdviceforInternationalTravellers/Factsheet/">sensible
precautions </a>can lessen the risk or illness or infection. It is also
important that everyone in your party, particularly young children, drink
plenty of <span>bottled</span> water if travelling to a hot country. </p>

<h3>Animals</h3>

<p>Encourage your children to stay away from all animals while abroad and never
attempt to bring an animal into Ireland on your return. The risk of rabies
infection may be quite small but you should seek medical advice immediately in
the event of any bites or scratches, especially those from dogs, cats or
monkeys, while abroad.</p>

<p>Orientation and mobility training is of crucial importance to many people
with vision impairments. Mobility training helps to develop skills required to
move around safely in the environment. Some people with vision impairments have
enough residual vision to move around independently. Other people may require a
mobility aid such as a long cane which will help the person to find a safe way
in front of them. Training may involve advising a person with low vision on how
to use their residual vision to move around more safely. It may also involve
more in-depth training in how to use a mobility aid such as a white cane or a
guide dog. </p>

<p>Types of mobility aids are described below. Two organisations in Ireland
provide orientation and mobility training for people with vision impairments
the <span>National Council for the Blind in Ireland</span> and <span>Irish
Guide Dogs for the Blind</span>. </p>

<h3>White canes and walking sticks</h3>

<p>There are three different types of white canes and also a white walking
stick available, but only two of the white canes are classed as mobility
aids:</p>
<ul><li>A <strong>white walking stick</strong> provides physical support for a
    person and indicates that the individual has sight loss. It is <em>not</em>
    a mobility aid.</li>
  <li>The <strong><span>symbol cane</span></strong> is used to indicate that a
    person holding it has impaired vision and may need assistance. It is
    <em>not</em> a mobility aid and does not provide physical support.</li>
  <li>The <strong>long cane</strong> is a mobility device which is used by
    sweeping the cane in an arc from side to side along the ground beyond the
    width of their body. This technique locates potential hazards and changes
    in the texture and level on the ground. Use of the long cane requires
    training.</li>
  <li>The <strong>guide cane</strong> is a mobility aid with more limited use
    than a long cane and, therefore, requires less training. It can be used in
    a diagonal position across the lower part of the body for protection or
    using a scanning technique to detect kerbs and steps. It does not provide
    physical support.</li>
</ul><h3>Guide Dogs</h3>

<p>In Ireland only certain breeds of dogs can become guide dogs. The main
breeds are labradors and golden retrievers, and crosses of these breeds. Dogs
that become guide dogs are only bred by Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind. Pups
are fostered by families for twelve months and are then returned to the Irish
Guide Dogs for the Blind to train for an eight month period. It is not possible
to have a family pet or puppy trained to be a guide dog.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The National Council for the Blind in Ireland (NCBI) provides orientation
and mobility training service which shows a person with a vision impairment how
to move about safely indoors and outdoors. It may involve building up a
person’s confidence to walk down their garden, go to their local shop, travel
on public transport or through crowded streets, traffic or country roads. </p>

<p>Trainers develop individual mobility programmes which may involve</p>
<ul><li>Teaching a person to maximise use of residual vision </li>
  <li>Body spatial and environmental awareness </li>
  <li>Use of sensory clues </li>
  <li>Orientation and mobility skills within the home, work, college or other
    everyday routes the person would like to become familiar with </li>
  <li>Road safety awareness and independent travel skills </li>
</ul><p>Training is also available for sighted relatives and friends of people with
vision impairments as to how to guide them effectively. The NCBI also provide
training in <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/vocational_education_and_training/training_and_apprentiship_programmes/life_skills_training_for_people_with_a_visual_impairment.html">life
skills for people with vision impairments</a>.</p>

<p>Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind offer two kinds of aids to people with vision
impairments: guide dogs and long canes. There is no upper age limit for
training with a guide dog but you must be over 18 years of age to apply. There
is a three to four week residential training course. When training is complete
the trainee returns home with the guide dog and an instructor will call in to
help with the ‘settling in process’. Regular contact and support are
maintained afterwards between the trainee and the instructor. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p><acronym title="National Council for the Blind in Ireland">NCBI</acronym> do
not charge for mobility training and they will supply two long canes per year
free of charge. Symbol canes and white walking sticks are also available free
of charge.</p>

<p>Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind do not charge for training courses or
equipment. A fee of €10 per week for board and lodging is payable for those
on residential training courses. A monthly guide dog feeding allowance is
available to guide dog owners should they need it.</p>

<p>Where you maintain a trained guide dog supplied by the Irish Guide Dogs for
the Blind, a <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/tax_reliefs_for_people_with_a_visual_impairment.html">Guide
Dog Allowance</a> may be claimed and after the first claim this is given as a
tax credit in your annual certificate of Tax Credits. A letter from Irish Guide
Dogs for the Blind confirming that you are a registered owner of a guide dog is
required when claiming the relief.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>The <acronym title="National Council for the Blind in Ireland">NCBI</acronym> has a network
of rehabilitation and community resource workers. If you would like to use the
services of the <acronym title="National Council for the Blind in Ireland">NCBI</acronym> you can
contact your local community resource worker. If you ring the head office of
the <acronym title="National Council for the Blind in Ireland">NCBI</acronym>
they will give you contact details for your local community resource worker.
The community resource worker will then refer you to your local mobility
specialist. The local mobility specialist will call out to consult on types of
training and routes you would like to learn.</p>

<p>You can apply to Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind yourself or through your
family doctor or GP. The Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind will supply you with an
information pack and an application form. The application form needs to be
returned to the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind along with a medical report from
your doctor confirming your vision impairment. A qualified instructor will then
visit your home to discuss the types of training available.</p>

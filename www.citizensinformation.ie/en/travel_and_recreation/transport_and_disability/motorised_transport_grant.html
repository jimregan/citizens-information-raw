<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Motorised Transport Grant is a means-tested Health Service Executive
(HSE) payment for people with disabilities who need to buy a car in order to
retain employment. This payment is also for people with disabilities who need
to have a car or other vehicle adapted in order to enable them to drive and, as
a result, earn a living.</p>

<p><strong>In 2013</strong>, <strong>the <a href="http://health.gov.ie/blog/press-release/mobility-allowance-and-motorised-transport-grant/">Department
of Health announced that the Motorised Transport Grant scheme was closed</a> to
new applicants.</strong> An <a href="http://health.gov.ie/blog/press-release/government-decision-in-relation-to-a-travel-subsidy-for-people-with-a-disability/">alternative
scheme is being devised</a> to replace it. This alternative scheme will be
called the Transport Support Scheme.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To be eligible to receive this grant, you must satisfy the following
conditions:</p>
<ul><li>You must be over 17 years (the upper age limit has been removed)</li>
  <li>Your disability must impede your use of public transport</li>
  <li>You must hold a driving licence</li>
  <li>You must be physically and mentally capable of driving</li>
  <li>You must require a car or other vehicle in order to retain employment.
    The HSE must be satisfied that you are capable of holding down the job.</li>
  <li>You must satisfy a means test</li>
</ul><p>You must require a car or other vehicle in order to retain employment. The
grant may also be considered in exceptional circumstances for people with
severe disabilities who are over 17 years, but who live in very isolated
locations and cannot use public transport.</p>

<p>It may be possible for you to get a grant if you are unemployed but could
take up work, which is available to you, if you had a car. Self-employed people
may be able to get a grant.</p>

<p>Normally, the grant is payable where you drive yourself. It may be possible
to get approval to have a grant paid where you own the car and arrange for its
adaptation and another named person drives it because you are not physically or
medically able to drive.</p>

<h3>How are means assessed?</h3>

<p>Your means and your spouse/partner's means, if any, are taken into account
in the means test for the grant. Means are determined on the basis of net
income (gross income less PAYE, PRSI and superannuation deductions) and
includes income from such things as investments and lettings. Payments for rent
or mortgage are deducted from income.</p>

<p>The following payments are not taken into account in accessing your
means:</p>
<ul><li>Blind Welfare Allowance</li>
  <li>Child Benefit</li>
  <li>Domiciliary Care Allowance</li>
  <li>Foster Care Allowance</li>
  <li>Higher Education Grants</li>
  <li>Living Alone Allowance</li>
  <li>Supplementary Welfare Allowance</li>
  <li>Income up to the maximum amount approved by the Department of Social
    Protection (DSP) from employment of a therapeutic or rehabilitative
  nature</li>
  <li>Monies received from charitable organisations other than remuneration</li>
  <li>Special compensation awards that are exempted by legislation, for
    example, Thalidomide</li>
  <li>Travel and meal allowances paid to participants on Government-approved
    schemes</li>
  <li>Repayments received under the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006</li>
</ul><h4>Carer’s payments</h4>

<p>If your spouse/partner is receiving Carer's Allowance/Benefit, the payment
is ignored. Instead, your income is assessed as being your primary payment plus
any increases for qualified children, plus the Supplementary Welfare Allowance
increase for a qualified adult.</p>

<p>Where Carer's Allowance/Benefit is paid in respect of you to someone who is
not your spouse/partner it is ignored and your income is assessed as being your
primary payment plus any increases for qualified children.</p>

<h4>Capital</h4>

<p>The formula used in the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/how_to_assess_your_means_from_capital_for_social_welfare_payments.html">assessment
of the income from capital</a> is the same as that used by the DSP in the means
test for Disability Allowance. </p>

<h3>What if you got a Motorised Transport Grant before?</h3>

<p>When a grant has previously been paid towards the purchase of a vehicle, a
grant towards the replacement of the car will not normally be paid, unless due
to extenuating circumstances, until 3 years from the date that the previous
grant has been paid.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>As the Motorised Transport Grant has been discontinued you cannot
apply for a grant towards the replacement of a car.</strong></p>

<p></p>

<h3>How is Mobility Allowance affected?</h3>

<p>If you receive a Motorised Transport Grant, while getting <a href="mobility_allowance.html">Mobility Allowance</a>, you will become
ineligible to receive Mobility Allowance for a period of 3 years. The payment
of a Motorised Transport Grant is subject to the condition that the Health
Service Executive (HSE) will not be called upon at any future date to
contribute towards the running costs of the vehicle. You will be eligible for
the Mobility Allowance again, 3 years after the date of payment of the
Motorised Transport Grant.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Is there other financial help for drivers and passengers with
disabilities?</h3>

<p>Severely and permanently disabled people who use specially adapted vehicles
as drivers and passengers are eligible for a range of <a href="tax_relief_for_disabled_drivers_and_disabled_passengers.html">tax
exemptions and refunds</a>. These schemes are run by the Revenue Commissioners
and the rules are set down in legislation. Qualifying for the HSE Motorised
Transport Grants does not guarantee that you will qualify for the tax
exemptions, nor does failure to qualify mean that you are not eligible.</p>

<h3>Are there parking cards for people with disabilities</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../traffic_and_parking/disabled_persons_parking_card.html">European
Parking Cards</a> are available to people with certain disabilities and people
who are registered blind, whether they are drivers or passengers. The parking
card can be used by a disabled person in any vehicle in which he or she is
travelling. The parking card scheme for disabled drivers and passengers applies
to public car parking areas only.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The maximum motorised transport grant is €5,020.50.</p>

<p>A grant of up to 75% of the cost of the motorised transport may be paid,
subject to the maximum grant. The cost of the motorised transport is the
purchase price:</p>
<ul><li>Less Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) and VAT if you are eligible for the
    VRT exemption and VAT refund</li>
  <li>Less trade-in price, where appropriate</li>
</ul><p>If your assessed means for the year are greater than the national average
industrial wage (€33,165 for 2010 applications), the excess is deducted from
the maximum grant payable for your situation.</p>

<p>For example, where a person with assessed annual means of €35,000 wants to
buy a car which costs €15,000 (after the deductions mentioned above) the
grant is calculated as follows:</p>
<ul><li>75% of the actual cost of the car (€15,000) is €11,250. This is
    greater than the maximum grant (€5,020.50), therefore the maximum grant
    payable is €5,020.50.</li>
  <li>The assessed means (€35,000) are greater than the average industrial
    wage (€33,165) by €1,835. This excess is deducted from the maximum
    grant payable (€5,020.50 less €1,835) to give €3,185.50 as the grant
    that is paid.</li>

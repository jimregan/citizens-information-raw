<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Mobility Allowance was a means tested monthly payment payable by the Health
Service Executive (HSE) to people who are aged 16 and over and under age 66,
and who have a disability and are unable to walk or use public transport and
who would benefit from a change in surroundings; (for example, by financing the
occasional taxi journey). There is no specific legislation providing for
Mobility Allowance. Instead, this Allowance was introduced in 1979 by the
Department of Health and is payable under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1970/en/act/pub/0001/sec0061.html#zza1y1970s61">Section
61 of the Health Act, 1970</a>. </p>

<p><strong>In 2013</strong>, the <a href="http://health.gov.ie/blog/press-release/mobility-allowance-and-motorised-transport-grant/">Department
of Health announced that the Mobility Allowanced scheme was closed</a> to new
applicants. An <a href="http://health.gov.ie/blog/press-release/government-decision-in-relation-to-a-travel-subsidy-for-people-with-a-disability/">alternative
scheme is being devised</a> replace it. This alternative scheme will be called
the Transport Support Scheme. In the meantime, the HSE continues to make
monthly payments to people who were getting the Mobility Allowance at the time
that the scheme closed.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p><strong>The Mobility Allowance Scheme is now closed. The following rules
applied when it was in operation:</strong></p>

<p>You are eligible for a Mobility Allowance if you meet the following
conditions:</p>
<ul><li>You are unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or other
    suitable aids, or your health is such that the exertion required to walk
    would be dangerous </li>
  <li>The inability to walk must be likely to last for at least a year </li>
  <li>You must not be medically forbidden to move </li>
  <li>You must be in a position to benefit from a change in surroundings </li>
  <li>You must be living at home or in a long-term institution </li>
  <li>You must pass a means test. </li>
</ul><p>The decision on whether or not you meet the medical criteria is made by the
HSE Senior Area Medical Officer for your area. </p>

<h3>Assessing income</h3>

<p>To determine the amount of Mobility Allowance you will receive, you
calculate your total assessable income. Some income is not assessable (see
Non-Assessable Income below). In the case of a couple both your incomes are
added together. Any amount in excess of the <em>appropriate weekly social
welfare payment</em> for your family is deducted from the maximum amount of
weekly Mobility Allowance payable to you. </p>

<p>The appropriate social welfare payment is Disability Allowance where you are
under age 66 and State Pension (Non-Contributory) where you are over age 66.
The appropriate weekly payment depends on whether you are a couple and have
dependent children or not. To calculate the maximum weekly Mobility Allowance,
you multiply the monthly rate (see Rates below) by 12 and then divide by 52.</p>

<p>In the case of a couple where both of you are eligible, half of any amount
in excess of the appropriate weekly social welfare payment for your family is
deducted from the maximum amount of weekly Mobility Allowance payable to you.
</p>

<h3>Non-Assessable Income</h3>

<p>The following payments are not taken into account in accessing your
means:</p>
<ul><li>Blind Welfare Allowance</li>
  <li>Child Benefit</li>
  <li>Domiciliary Care Allowance</li>
  <li>Foster Care Allowance</li>
  <li>Higher Education Grants</li>
  <li>National Fuel Scheme Allowance payments</li>
  <li>Living Alone Allowance</li>
  <li>Over 80 Allowance</li>
  <li>Supplementary Welfare Allowance</li>
  <li>Income up to the maximum amount approved by the Department of Social
    Protection (DSP) from employment of a therapeutic or rehabilitative
  nature</li>
  <li>Monies received from charitable organisations other than remuneration</li>
  <li>Special compensation awards that are exempted by legislation, for
    example, Thalidomide</li>
  <li>Travel and meal allowances paid to participants on Government-approved
    schemes</li>
  <li>Repayments received under the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006</li>
  <li>The benefit of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax
    Concessions) Scheme</li>
</ul><h4>Carer’s payments</h4>

<p>If your spouse/civil partner/cohabitant is receiving Carer's Allowance or
Carer's Benefit, the payment is ignored. Instead, your income is assessed as
being your primary payment plus any increases for qualified children, plus the
Supplementary Welfare Allowance increase for a qualified adult.</p>

<p>Where Carer's Allowance or Carer's Benefit is paid in respect of you to
someone who is not your spouse/civil partner/cohabitant, it is ignored and you
are assessed on your own assessable income.</p>

<h4>Capital</h4>

<p>The formula used in the <a href="../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/how_to_assess_your_means_from_capital_for_social_welfare_payments.html">assessment
of the income from capital</a> is the same as that used by the DSP in the means
test for Disability Allowance.</p>

<h3>Motorised Transport Grant <br></h3>

<p>If you receive a <a shape="rect" href="motorised_transport_grant.html">Motorised Transport Grant</a>, having
previously received the Mobility Allowance, you will no longer receive the
Mobility Allowance. This is because the payment of a Motorised Transport Grant
is subject to the condition that the HSE will not be called upon at any future
date to contribute towards the running costs of the vehicle. </p>

<p>You will not be eligible for the Mobility Allowance again until three years
after the date of payment of the Motorised Transport Grant. </p>

<h3>Appealing the refusal of Mobility Allowance</h3>

<p>There is no statutory appeal scheme for Mobility Allowance. In other words,
if you have been refused Mobility Allowance by your Local Health Office, your
right to appeal is not set down in law. Where an applicant is refused, the HSE
will formally notify you of their decision (in writing) and include details of
how to appeal this decision. </p>

<p>Appeal procedures for Mobility Allowance can vary from one Local Health
Office to another. Some Local Health Offices for example, will conduct a review
hearing' where independent Senior Medical Officers will meet the applicant and
review their application, including the medical evidence. Other Local Health
Offices may refer the appeal to their Appeals Office for review. Contact your
Local Health Office for information on the appeals process in your area. </p>

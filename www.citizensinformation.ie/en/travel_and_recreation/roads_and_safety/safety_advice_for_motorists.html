<p>When you are driving a car, being aware of the various dangers on the road,
your own driving style and your obligations as a road user will help to ensure
that you travel safely.</p>

<p>Before you drive you must ensure that the car is <a href="../motoring_1/motor_tax_and_insurance/motor_insurance.html">insured</a>,
<a href="../motoring_1/motor_tax_and_insurance/motor_tax_rates.html">taxed</a>
and the <a href="../vehicle_standards/national_car_test.html">NCT test</a>
for the car has been completed and all discs are displayed on the windscreen.
You must also hold a <a href="../motoring_1/driver_licensing/learner_driving_permits_for_cars_and_work_vehicles.html">driving
licence to drive a car</a>. Check all lights and indicators and make sure your
windscreen is clean and free from anything that might obstruct your vision.
Check to make sure your horn is working.</p>

<p>When driving you should:</p>
<ul><li>Drive at a speed appropriate to the road and weather conditions, the
    volume of traffic present and the likelihood of hazards. Speed limits are
    the maximum speed you can drive at on a stretch of road in good
  conditions.</li>
  <li>Never drink and drive. Alcohol affects your judgement, vision,
    co-ordination and reaction time.</li>
  <li>Wear your seatbelt. Every passenger in the car is also required by law to
    wear a seatbelt.</li>
  <li>Take a break from driving if you feel tired – a nap of 15 to 20 minutes
    can help.</li>
  <li>Never use a hand held mobile phone. Any distraction when driving can be
    dangerous.</li>
  <li>Use your dipped headlights to see and be seen if visibility is poor.</li>
  <li>Only use fog lights when there is fog or falling snow. Switch them off
    when conditions improve.</li>
</ul><p>You can find a <a href="http://www.garda.ie/Documents/User/english%20traffic%202.5.12.pdf">leaflet on
road safety information (pdf)</a> for motorists, pedestrians and cyclists on

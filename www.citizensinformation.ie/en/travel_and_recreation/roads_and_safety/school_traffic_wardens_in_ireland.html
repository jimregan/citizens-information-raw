<p>Every local authority can make arrangements with the Commissioner of an
Garda Siochana for the patrolling of places where school children cross public
roads. Those who patrol these places are known as School Traffic Wardens. Their
role is to ensure that school children cross public roads on their way to/from
school safely. In general, School Traffic Wardens only patrol areas where
primary school (and not secondary school children) cross public roads. Together
with the Gardai (Irish police force), School Traffic Wardens are the only
officials in Ireland who have the authority to stop other vehicles on public
roads. </p>

<p>The law governing the appointment of School Traffic Wardens is (<a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1961/en/act/pub/0024/sec0096.html#zza24y1961s96">Section
96</a>) of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1961/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Road
Traffic Act, 1961</a>. School Traffic Wardens usually work in the mornings, at
lunchtime and in the evenings when children are most likely to cross the road
to go to/from school. </p>

<p>School Traffic Wardens wear a distinctive uniform (a high-visability coat
and hat). Wardens must also carry a distinctive sign (a white disc with a red
border and the words "Stop" in the centre). </p>

<p>The School Traffic Warden has the power to exhibit the sign thereby
requiring all traffic to stop and remain stopped to enable school children to
cross the road in safety. Traffic must remain stopped as long as the Warden
exhibits the sign. </p>

<h3>Junior Traffic Wardens Scheme</h3>

<p>In many places, Junior Traffic Wardens (usually senior pupils of primary
schools) operate in teams to provide the same service as the School Traffic
Warden. Junior Traffic Wardens operate in teams of six and a signal requesting
traffic to stop is given from both sides of the road. After traffic stops, the
six Junior Traffic Wardens take up their position and guide younger children
across the public road. All vehicles must remain stopped until all the Junior
Traffic Wardens have returned to the footpath. To ensure that Junior Traffic
Wardens can carry out their function properly, it is vital that they have a
clear view of the road. Drivers should never stop or park in positions where
they could obstruct the view of Junior Traffic Wardens or School Traffic
Wardens. </p>

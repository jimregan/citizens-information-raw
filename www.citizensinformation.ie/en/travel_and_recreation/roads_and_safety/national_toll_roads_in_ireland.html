<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Toll roads are in existence throughout the world and have been in operation
in Ireland since the 1980s. In general toll roads impose a toll (levy or
charge) on each vehicle using these roads. Transport Infrastructure Ireland
(TII) has responsibility for overseeing the implementation of tolling
throughout Ireland. In addition, TII also has responsibility for planning,
supervising constructing and maintaining all national roads. </p>

<h3>Why are toll charges imposed?</h3>

<p>Transport Infrastructure Ireland is empowered by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1979/en/act/pub/0034/index.html">Local
Government (Toll Roads) Act, 1979</a> to charge and collect tolls for the use
of certain roads by vehicles. Before a toll may be imposed on a road, a bye-law
under the Act must be passed. </p>

<p>Major new road developments are now undertaken and funded through Public
Private Partnership (PPP). This means that part of the funding for road
building and maintenance comes from public sources (i.e., the Irish government)
and part of the funding comes from private commercial sources. Transport
Infrastructure Ireland use of Public Private Partnership projects is in
accordance with the strategy of using tolling to the maximum extent possible on
these roads to recoup part at least of the substantial private sector
investment involved.</p>

<p>Under the approach being pursued by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, toll
roads are being constructed as additions to the current network of national
roads rather than providing a means of improvement of existing roads. </p>

<h3>New toll road schemes</h3>

<p>Each time a toll scheme is proposed for a road, Transport Infrastructure
Ireland must publish a public notice notifying citizens in the area that this
change is being proposed. In addition, Transport Infrastructure Ireland is
required to produce a Draft Toll Scheme and citizens are invited to inspect the
scheme for a period of one month and make observations/submissions on the
scheme. </p>

<p>If you have an objection to the scheme, you must make your objections
clearly in writing to Transport Infrastructure Ireland on or before the
specified date. </p>

<p>The Draft Toll Scheme for a particular road and its accompanying Explanatory
Statement will be prepared in accordance with the statutory provisions of the
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0014/index.html">Roads Act
1993</a>, as amended by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0030/index.html">Planning
and Development Act 2000</a>. </p>

<p>Transport Infrastructure Ireland will serve a Notice on the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/local_and_regional_government/local_authorities.html">local
authorities</a> in whose areas the proposed toll road will be located informing
them that a Draft Toll Scheme has been prepared for the road concerned and
indicating that representations in relation to the proposal may be made in
writing to TII within a specified period. </p>

<p>If objections to the Draft Toll Scheme are received and not withdrawn,
Transport Infrastructure Ireland will arrange an oral hearing in the areas
where the proposed toll road will be located to enquire into the matters to
which the objections relate. The report and recommendations of the person
appointed to hold the hearing will be considered by the Board of Transport
Infrastructure Ireland prior to determining whether or not to adopt the Draft
Toll Scheme. </p>

<p>Transport Infrastructure Ireland may adopt the Draft Toll Scheme with or
without modifications or may refuse to adopt it. </p>

<p>The decision of TII on the Toll Scheme proposal will be published. </p>

<h3>Exemptions from toll charges</h3>

<p>Certain vehicles are exempt from toll charges. The vehicles in question are
vehicles belonging to and used for official purposes by the Defence Forces,
vehicles used by An Garda Siochana (the Irish police force), <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/security_and_emergency_services/fire_services.html">fire
brigade vehicles</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../../health/emergency_health_services/emergency_health_services_in_ireland.html">ambulances</a>.
</p>

<p>Vehicles adapted for disabled drivers or passengers are also entitled to
exemption from toll fees. Toll road operators issue special passes which are
recognised by all other toll road operators and which allow such vehicles pass
through the tolls without paying. To obtain a special pass apply to <a shape="rect" href="http://www.tii.ie/roads-tolling/tolling-information/disabled-drivers/">your
nearest toll road operator</a>.</p>

<h3>Penalties for not paying toll fees</h3>

<p>Tolls and penalties can be recovered either through a criminal or civil
procedure.</p>

<h4>Criminal procedure</h4>

<p>You can be charged with an offence of not paying your toll or not obeying
the instruction of an authorised person. The penalty on summary conviction is a
fine not exceeding €5,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 6 months,
or both.</p>

<p>On the M50, the bye-laws set out penalties for those who fail, refuse or
neglect to pay toll fees. These are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Initial default - penalty charge of €3.00</li>
  <li>After 14 days - additional penalty charge of €41.00</li>
  <li>After further 56 days - additional penalty charge of €102.50</li>
  <li>Total fines per passage - €146.50</li>
</ul><h4>Civil procedure</h4>

<p>The amount of tolls and penalties due are recoverable as a contract debt.
The registered owner of a vehicle is responsible even if you are not driving
the vehicle. This can be costly if there are multiple passages. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>It is an offence to fail, neglect or refuse to pay a toll on a national
road.</p>

<p>Failure to pay your toll will mean that you cannot pass along the road. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.tii.ie/roads-tolling/tolling-information/toll-locations-and-charges/">toll
rates for the toll roads</a> are available on Transport Infrastructure
Ireland's website.</p>

<p>The Dublin Port Tunnel imposes a toll on cars, taxis, motorcycles, vans and
light commercial vehicles only. Commercial vehicles above 3.5 tonnes laden
weight and buses wih more than 25 seats do not pay tolls. </p>

<p>VAT registered road users can reclaim VAT paid on tolls.</p>

<p>Payment of tolls is facilitated in two ways - by payment of cash or by
eToll.</p>

<h3>eToll</h3>

<p>Electronic tolling allows motorists to use electronic tolling lanes, thereby
saving time and the need to carry cash when travelling through a toll road.
Electronic tolling uses a small electronic tag that is placed in the vehicle
and is detected each time your vehicle passes through the toll. The toll is
then debited against the customer's account. The electronic tolling system
automatically recognises the correct toll for the class of vehicle you are
driving. </p>

<p>There are a number of companies providing electronic tags to motorists. All
these providers use the same system which means you only need one tag for all
tolling facilities. Information on suppliers of electronic tags and the
different types of tag accounts is available at <a shape="rect" href="http://www.tagcompare.ie">tagcompare.ie</a>.</p>

<p>Since August 2008 the West Link Bridge on the M50 operates a barrier-free
tolling scheme called eFlow. This allows all motorists to pass through the toll
at motorway speed. There are three methods of paying the tolls including using
an electronic tag from eflow or a supplier mentioned. Charges varying depending
on the method used. You cannot pay the toll with cash at the West Link Bridge,
but the toll must be paid by 8 pm the next day. You can find out more about the
toll scheme at <a shape="rect" href="https://www.eflow.ie/help-guidance/faqs/">eflow.ie</a>. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lf59a2">How to pay</h2>

<p>Generally, toll charges are paid at the barrier to the toll road. You can
pay either in cash, or by using an eToll tag. For the West Link Bridge, if you
do not have an account you must <a shape="rect" href="http://eflow.ie/">pay
online</a>, by phoning Locall 1890 501 050 or through <a shape="rect" href="http://www.payzone.ie">Payzone outlets</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="lef21f">Where to apply</h2>

<p>If you are interested in obtaining an eToll tag, simply contact one of the
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.tagcompare.ie/getting-a-tag/irish-tag-companies/">companies
providing electronic tolling tags</a>. If you have a complaint about a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.tii.ie/roads-tolling/tolling-information/toll-locations-and-charges/">toll
road operator</a> or your electronic tag provider, you should contact the
company to find out how to make a complaint.</p>

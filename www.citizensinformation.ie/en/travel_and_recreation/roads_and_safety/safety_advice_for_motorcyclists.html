<p>While motorcyclists represent less than 2% of all licensed vehicle drivers
in the country, they account for 12% of road fatalities. Motorcycling can be a
safe means of transport but being aware of the various dangers on the road,
your own driving style and your obligations as a road user will help to ensure
that you travel safely. </p>

motorcycle: </p>
<ul><li>Know the <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Safe-Driving1/Rules-of-the-Road/">Rules
    of the Road</a> and be aware of your obligations as a motorcyclist</li>
  <li>Ensure that your motorcycle is roadworthy at all times; this includes
    ensuring your tyres are of correct tread depth and that all lights and
    reflectors are functioning correctly</li>
  <li>Wear an approved helmet and protective clothing </li>
  <li>Concentrate when driving 100% of the time</li>
  <li>Try to foresee danger on the road</li>
  <li>Drive at a speed that enables you to stop within the appropriate
    distance, if you need to stop</li>
  <li>Maintain a safe distance between you and the vehicle in front of you</li>
  <li>Be aware of adverse weather and poor road conditions</li>

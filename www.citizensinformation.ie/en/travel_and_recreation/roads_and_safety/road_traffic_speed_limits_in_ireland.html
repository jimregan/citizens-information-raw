<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.transport.ie">Department of Transport,
Tourism and Sport</a> sets national speed limits. There are five different
types of speed limits and different limits apply to different types of roads
throughout the country. If you are coming to Ireland for the first time or you
are learning to drive, it is important for you to be aware of the speed limit
on the roads. </p>

<p>Speed limits are expressed through distinctive road signs throughout the
country that state the limit in each area. These signs are found on every
motorway and on major roads and minor roads throughout Ireland and consist of a
circular sign with a white background and a red border. The speed limit in
kilometres is shown in the centre of the sign in black numerals (i.e. 30
kilometres per hour, 60, 80, etc.). <span>Road distances and speed limits in
Ireland are measured in kilometres.</span></p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>The Irish police force (Garda Síochána) is responsible for enforcing road
traffic legislation to ensure that citizens comply with speed limits. This
means the Gardaí are responsible for detecting speeding offences and
initiating proceedings by issuing fixed penalties to motorists who break speed
limits.</p>

<p>An Garda Síochána has contracted the GoSafe consortium to operate safety
cameras on their behalf. The safety cameras, operated by GoSafe staff have been
on roads which have a history of collisions occurring where speed was a
contributory factor. The cameras operate from vans which are marked with high
visibility reflective material and display a safety camera symbol. <a href="http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=5590&amp;Lang=1">Further

<h3>Road speed limits</h3>

<p>There are a total of five different types of speed limits throughout
Ireland:</p>
<ul><li>Town and city speed limits </li>
  <li>National road speed limits </li>
  <li>Regional and local road speed limits </li>
  <li>Motorway speed limits </li>
  <li>Special speed limits </li>
</ul><h3>Town and city speed limits (50 km/h)</h3>

<p>A speed limit of 50 kilometres per hour is in place in built-up areas (other
than motorways or special speed limit zones). </p>

<h3>National road speed limits (100 km/h)</h3>

<p>A speed limit of 100 kilometres per hour is in place on all national roads
(including dual carriageways) throughout Ireland. </p>

<h3>Regional and local speed limits (80 km/h)</h3>

<p>A speed limit of 80 kilometres per hour is in place on all regional and
local roads (sometimes referred to as non-national roads). </p>

<h3>Motorway speed limits (120 km/h)</h3>

<p>A speed limit of 120 kilometres per hour is in place on all motorways. You
should note that learner drivers, vehicles under 50 cc, bicycles, pedestrians,
animals and invalid carriages are not allowed on motorways in Ireland. </p>

<h3>Special speed limits (30 km/h or 60 km/h.)</h3>

<p>Special speed limits are sometimes applied to designated roads and zones
(mainly, for example, on roads on the outside of built-up areas, around
schools, etc.). Special speed limits are generally for 30 km/h or 60 km/h. <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/local_and_regional_government/local_authorities.html">Local
authorities</a> in Ireland have the power to introduce bye-laws to set special
speed limits in designated areas. Read more about <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/local_and_regional_government/powers_of_local_authorities.html">powers
of local authorities here</a>. </p>

<h3>Ordinary speed limits</h3>

<p>Certain vehicles in Ireland (specifically vehicles that are intended or
adapted for the carriage of people, vehicles greater than a certain weight and
vehicles that are drawing trailers) are subject to different speed limits than
those outlined above.</p>
<ul><li>Single and double deck buses and coaches (carrying standing passengers) -
    65 km/h</li>
  <li>Single and double deck buses and coaches (with accommodation for more
    than 8 passengers but does not carry standing passengers)<br>
    - Motorways and dual carriageways - 100 km/h<br>
    - Other roads - 80 km/h</li>
  <li>Towing Vehicles - 80 km/h </li>
  <li>Trucks (with a design gross weight of more than 3,500kg)<br>
    - Motorways - 90 km/h (since 1 April 2012)<br>
    - Other roads - 80 km/h </li>
</ul><h3>Exceptions to speed limits</h3>

<p>Speed limits do not apply in Ireland to ambulances, fire brigade services or
Garda vehicles being used in the course of duty.</p>

<p>Further information regarding the various speed limits in place throughout
Ireland is available on the <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/Documents/Learner%20Drivers/Rules_of_the_road.pdf">Rules
of the Road website (pdf).</a></p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<p>It is an offence for anyone to use a speed meter detector in any vehicle in
Ireland under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/si/0050.html">Road Traffic (Speed
Meter Detectors) Regulations, 1991</a>. Under this legislation, it is also an
offence to import, fit and supply speed meter detectors and jammers. </p>

<p>The Gardai are empowered to seize this equipment if it is found in your
vehicle or in your possession under the Customs Consolidation Act 1876. </p>

points on your driving licence. You have 28 days in which to pay your
fixed-charge fine from the date the notice issues. Failure to pay the fixed
charge will result in an increased fine of €120 and possibly more penalty
points up to a maximum of 5 penalty points. If you were not the driver of the
vehicle, you must complete the relevant section on the notice and return it
within 28 days of its issue.</p>

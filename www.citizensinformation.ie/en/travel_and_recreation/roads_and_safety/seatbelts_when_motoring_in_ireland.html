<p>Each year in Ireland, many people are hurt, seriously injured or killed on
our roads and much of this injury and many of the deaths would not occur if
drivers and passengers were adequately restrained by safety belts or child
restraint systems (CRS). There is a legal obligation to be restrained and this
applies to drivers and passengers. Furthermore, there is an additional onus on
drivers to ensure that persons under 17 are suitably restrained while they are
in charge of the vehicle.Offences carry a fixed-charge fine of €60. You must
pay this fine within 28 days, or face an increased fine of €90 payable within
56 days of the offence. Two penalty points will be added to your licence if you
opt not to go to court. If you are convicted in court for not wearing a
seatbelt, four penalty points will be added to your licence and you will be
liable to an €2,000 fine. </p>

<p>This document is an overview of the law currently in place regarding the
wearing of seatbelts and child restraints in motor vehicles. Information is
also provided regarding those exempted under the law. </p>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1971/en/si/0096.html">Road Traffic
(Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations 1971</a>,
the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/si/0359.html">Road Traffic
(Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations 1991</a>
and <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/si/0240.html">SI 240/2006 European
Communities (Compulsory Use of Safety Belts and Child Restraint Systems in
Motor Vehicles</a>), the majority of people travelling in motor vehicles in
Ireland are required to wear a seatbelt or child restraint at all times.
Certain people however, are exempt from these requirements. As a driver or
passenger, it is in your interest to know the requirements and your
obligations. It is worth noting that the law has to allow for exceptional
circumstances and that it is not totally comprehensive. There may be situations
where wearing is not mandatory but is, nonetheless, advisable - for example
when giving driving tuition. Definitions of "seatbelts", "child restraints" and
"disabled persons belts" are provided below. A special section also covers
children and seatbelt requirements. </p>

<h3>What is a safety belt and what is a child restraint?</h3>

<p>A safety belt consists of an assembly of straps adequately fixed to the
vehicle, with a securing buckle. These straps must be capable of being
adjusted. In the event of an accident or incident, the safety belt is designed
to minimise the risk of injury by restraining your movements. </p>

<p>A child restraint is a device designed for use by a child weighing 36 kg or
less. The restraint is fitted directly to a suitable belt or is held in place
by the action of a safety belt, which in turn restrains movement in the event
of an accident or incident. An appropriate child restraint is one appropriate
to the weight of the child. The weight range is indicated on the child
restraint. Examples of appropriate restraint systems are baby car seats and
booster cushions.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Use of safety belts and child restraints</h3>

<p>The law in Ireland requires that certain vehicles must have seatbelts. These
vehicles are: </p>
<ul><li>Passenger vehicles that accommodate less than 8 people (excluding the
    driver) </li>
  <li>Passenger vehicles that accommodate more than 8 passengers and that have
    a gross vehicle weight of less than 3,500 kg </li>
  <li>Goods vehicles that have a gross vehicle weight of less than 3,500 kg
  </li>
</ul><p>From 31 October 2011 all buses involved in the organised transport of
children are required to be fitted with the appropriate safety belts or
restraint systems for the number of children being transported.</p>

<p>Since 1st January 1971, all drivers and anyone occupying a forward facing
front seat of any of the vehicles listed above must wear a safety belt or an
appropriate child restraint, unless they are exempted. (See "exemptions"
below). </p>

<p>Passengers travelling in buses fitted with safety belts must be informed of
the requirement to wear them.</p>

<h3>Children and seatbelts</h3>

<h3>0-3 years</h3>

<p>Babies and children under 3 may not travel in a car or goods vehicle (other
than a taxi) unless restrained in an appropriate child restraint. <span>This
requirement applies to all of the vehicles listed above, irrespective of when
they were registered - as long as they are equipped with safety belts.
</span>(Again, a child restraint is a device designed for use by a child
weighing 36 kg or less). The restraint is fitted directly to a suitable belt or
is held in place by the action of a safety belt, which in turn restrains
movement in the event of an accident or incident. An appropriate child
restraint is one appropriate to the weight of the child. The weight range is
indicated on the child restraint.</p>

<p>Rear facing child restraints must not be used in seats protected by an
active frontal air-bag and child restraints must be in accordance with EU or UN
standards. </p>

<h3>3-17 years</h3>

<p>Children over 3 years of age may occupy a forward facing front seat of a
vehicle <strong>only</strong> if they are using a safety belt or an appropriate
child restraint. Otherwise, they must travel in a rear seat. Children under 150
centimetres in height and weighing less than 36 kilograms (generally children
up to 11/12 years old) must use the correct child seat or booster cushion. </p>

<p>Passengers aged 3 years or over must wear safety belts where they are
fitted, when travelling by bus. </p>

<h3>Pre-1992 registered vehicles</h3>

<p>All cars first registered in Ireland since 1st June 1971, are required to
have safety belts fitted on front seats. Rear seats have to be equipped with
safety belts on all cars first registered since 1992. If seatbelts are not
provided in the back of your pre-1992 car, then passengers are exempted from
the law requiring them to use a safety belt (or child restraint) when
travelling in the back of your car. However, if you have a pre-1992 car, it is
<span>strongly recommended</span> you have safety belts or, perhaps, child
restraints appropriate to the intended use, fitted. Many pre-1992 cars have
anchorages for safety belts making the fitment of safety belts or child
restraint systems a relatively inexpensive proposition. </p>

<h3>Safety belts and disabled passengers</h3>

<p>A "disabled persons belt" is a safety belt which has been specially designed
or adapted for use by someone with a physical disability. Disabled persons
belts should only be used by those for whom they are intended. </p>

<h3>Exemptions from requirement to wear seatbelts</h3>
<ol><li>If you are sitting on a seat that is not fitted with a safety belt</li>
  <li>If you are giving instruction in respect of the driving of a vehicle
    (i.e., you are teaching someone else how to drive). This is another example
    of a case where it <span>might not</span> be so wise to avail of the
    leniency of the law.</li>
  <li>If you are driving test examiner conducting a driving test </li>
  <li>If you are a member of An Garda Siochana or the Defence Forces and are
    driving as part of your duties</li>
  <li>If you hold a medical certificate signed by a qualified medical
    practitioner stating it is inadvisable on medical grounds you wear a
    seatbelt or child restraint</li>
</ol><p>Since July 2004 drivers of small public service vehicles (i.e., taxis) are
required to wear seatbelts when driving these vehicles.</p>

<h3>Enforcement of seatbelt regulations</h3>

<p>An Garda Siochana (the Irish police force) is empowered by law to enforce
seatbelt regulations throughout Ireland. Unless you are among those exempted
under the law, <span>it is a statutory offence</span> to fail to wear a
seatbelt or use an appropriate child restraint where <span>one is provided in
the vehicle</span>.</p>

<p>Measures introduced by Government have increased fines for non-wearing of
seatbelts and child restraints. The measures impose fixed-charge fines and
penalty points, to ensure drivers comply with the law. Further information is
available in our <a href="../motoring_1/driving_offences/driving_offences.html">document on
driving offences</a>. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l07de2">Introduction </h2>

<p>Where you lose your job due to circumstances such as the closure of the
business or a reduction in the number of staff this is known as <a shape="rect" href="overview_redundancy.html">redundancy</a>. Generally a redundancy
situation arises if your job ceases to exist and you are not replaced. The
reasoning for the redundancy situation could be the financial position of the
firm, lack of work, reorganisation within the firm or it may be closing down
completely. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1967_0021.htm">Redundancy
Payments Acts 1967â€“2014</a> provide a minimum entitlement to a <a shape="rect" href="redundancy_payments.html">redundancy payment</a> for
employees who have a set period of service with the employer. Not all employees
are entitled to this statutory redundancy payment, even where a redundancy
situation exists. If you do qualify for redundancy there are specific <a shape="rect" href="redundancy_procedures.html">redundancy procedures</a> which
employers and employees must follow in order to comply with the legislation.
</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To be eligible for a redundancy payment under the Acts, you must satisfy the
following requirements:</p>
<ul><li>You must be aged 16 or over. (Since 8 May 2007 there is no upper age
    limit of 66.) </li>
  <li>You must be in employment that is insurable under the Social Welfare
    Acts. Full-time employees under the age of 66 must be paying Class A PRSI.
    (This insurability requirement does not apply to part-time workers - see
    below.) </li>
  <li>You must have worked continuously for your employer for at least 104
    weeks over the age of 16. </li>
  <li>You must have been made redundant.</li>
</ul><h3>Continuous employment</h3>

<p>In deciding whether you have worked continuously for your employer for at
least 104 weeks (2 years), the following situations will not break the
continuity of your service:</p>
<ul><li>You were on <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/maternity_leave.html">maternity
    leave</a>, <a href="../../employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/paternity_leave.html">paternity
    leave</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/adoptive_leave.html">adoptive
    leave</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/parental_leave.html">parental
    leave</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/carers_leave_from_employment.html">carer's
    leave</a> </li>
  <li>You were off work through illness, agreed absence, holidays or lay off
  </li>
  <li>You were dismissed due to redundancy before reaching 104 weeks' service
    and then taken back by your employer within 26 weeks of that dismissal </li>
  <li>You have been re-employed within 4 weeks of dismissal by an associate
    company of your previous employer </li>
  <li>You have been voluntarily transferred to another employer and it is
    agreed that the continuity of your service will not be broken </li>
  <li>You are placed back in your employment under the <a shape="rect" href="../dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfair dismissals legislation</a>
  </li>
  <li>You are on strike or locked out of your employment </li>
  <li>There has been a <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/contracts_of_employment/transfer_of_business.html">transfer
    of the business you work for to a new owner</a> </li>
</ul><p>If you are an apprentice, the same rules apply to you and you may qualify
for redundancy payment unless you are dismissed within one month after the end
of your apprenticeship.</p>

<p>Agency employees are also protected under redundancy legislation. If the
employment agency pays the wages, it is responsible for paying the statutory
redundancy payment.</p>

<h3>Part-time workers</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0014/index.html">Redundancy
Payments Act 2003</a> amended the insurability requirements for redundancy to
ensure the rights of part-time workers to statutory redundancy. This amendment
brings them into line with the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0045/index.html">Protection
of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001</a> which provides that part-time
employees cannot be treated in a less favourable manner than comparable
full-time employees in relation to conditions of employment. </p>

<p>It means that the right of certain part-time workers (such as those in
casual employment or in employment of inconsiderable extent) to statutory
redundancy is now recognised. They must still meet the requirement for 2 years'
continuous service as described above.</p>

<h3>Dismissal must have occurred</h3>

<p>In order to demonstrate that dismissal must have occurred there must have
been a termination of your employment, with or without notice. Even if you are
<a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/contracts_of_employment/fixed_term_or_specified_purpose_contracts.html">employed
for a fixed term</a> there is a dismissal if that term expires without being
renewed under the same or a similar contract. </p>

<p>There will also be a dismissal if you have terminated your contract of
employment in circumstances where, due to the behaviour of your employer, your
action is considered justified. This is known as <a shape="rect" href="../dismissal/constructive_dismissal.html">constructive dismissal</a>. </p>

<h3>Unfair selection for redundancy</h3>

<p>Although a redundancy situation exists, you may have grounds for complaint
if the manner of your selection for redundancy was unfair.</p>

<p>In selecting a particular employee for redundancy, an employer should apply
selection criteria that are reasonable and are applied in a fair manner. You
are entitled to bring a claim for unfair dismissal if you consider that you
were unfairly selected for redundancy or consider that a genuine redundancy
situation did not exist. Examples of these situations might include where the
custom and practice in your workplace has been last in, first out and your
selection did not follow this procedure. Another example may be where your
contract of employment sets out criteria for selection which were not
subsequently followed. </p>

<p>Under the unfair dismissals legislation, selection for redundancy based on
certain specific grounds is considered unfair. These include redundancy as the
result of an employee's trade union activity, pregnancy or religious or
political opinions. <br>
The <a href="http://www.ihrec.ie/publications/list/ihrec-employment-equality-rights-explained/">employment
equality legislation</a> also prohibits selection for redundancy that is based
on any of the following nine grounds: gender, civil status, family status, age,
disability, religious belief, race, sexual orientation or membership of the
Traveller community.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>Your employer must give you at least 2 weeks' notice of the redundancy. On
the date of the termination of employment your employer should pay the
redundancy lump sum due to you.</p>

<p>If your employer has not paid your redundancy lump sum, you should apply to
your employer for it using form <a href="http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Claim_by_an_Employee_Against_an_Employer_for_a_Lump_Sum_or_Part_of_a_Lump_Sum_RP77_.pdf">RP77
(pdf)</a>. If your employer still refuses to pay it, you can apply to the
Department of Social Protection for direct payment from the Social Insurance
Fund. This must be done <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Online-Redundancy-Claim.aspx">online using
form RP50.</a> You can read more details about this in our document on <a href="redundancy_procedures.html">redundancy procedures</a>.</p>

<p>You can read this list of <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Schemes/RedundancyandInsolvency/redundancy/Pages/RedundancyPaymentsFrequentlyAskedQuestions.aspx">frequently
asked questions</a> about redundancy.</p>

<p>If you believe you have been unfairly selected for redundancy, you may make
a claim of unfair dismissal under the <a href="http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Guide_to_the_Unfair_Dismissals_Acts.pdf">unfair
dismissals legislation (pdf)</a>. You must use the online complaint form
available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.
</p>

<p>Note: if you make a claim for unfair dismissal, you cannot also claim
redundancy.</p>

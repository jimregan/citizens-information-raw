<p>If you are being <a shape="rect" href="losing_your_job.html">dismissed from
your job or made redundant</a> you may have certain entitlements including
notice and pay for annual leave earned but not taken.</p>

<p>This is a checklist of what your employer must give you when you leave
work:</p>
<ul><li>P45 – a statement of your pay and deductions – see ‘P45’
  below</li>
  <li><a href="../../employment_rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/leaving_work_without_being_paid.html">Pay
    that you are owed for work</a> you have done – see ‘Pay’ below</li>
  <li><a href="../../employment_rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/pay_slip.html">Payslip</a>
    – showing your gross pay and any deductions</li>
  <li>Payment for annual leave which you have earned but not taken – see
    ‘Holiday pay’ below</li>
  <li>Payment instead of notice if you have not worked your notice period –
    see ‘Notice’ below</li>
  <li>Information about what happens to your <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/occupational_pensions.html">pension
    scheme</a> if applicable</li>
</ul><h3>P45</h3>

<p>When you leave your job <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/no_p45_no_p60.html">your
employer must give you a P45</a>. This is a statement of your pay and the tax,
<a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">Universal
Social Charge (USC)</a> and PRSI to date deducted by your employer. It is a
very important document and you need it if:</p>
<ul><li>You are <a shape="rect" href="../../starting_work_and_changing_job/changing_job/change_job_tax_prsi.html">starting
    a new job</a> – to give to your new employer in order to avoid paying
    emergency tax </li>
  <li>You are <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/">unemployed
    </a>– to claim a tax refund, to claim social welfare benefits </li>
</ul><p>The date on your P45 is the date that you physically leave the job. For tax
and social welfare purposes your employment has ceased. Under employment law,
the termination date of your employment may be different – see ‘Payment
instead of notice’ below.</p>

<p>If your employer does not give you a P45 you should ask for it – see
‘How to apply’ below. <br></p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l24efa">Notice</h2>

<p>You may be entitled to notice if you are being let go from your job. This
means that you are given notice that your job will end, and a date in the near
future when this will come into effect. The length of notice you are entitled
to, will depend in the first place on your contract of employment. In addition,
there is a minimum entitlement set out in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1973/en/act/pub/0004/index.html">Minimum
Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973–2005</a>. </p>

<p>In order to be entitled to the statutory minimum, you must have been working
for your employer for at least 13 weeks.</p>

<h3>Minimum period of notice</h3>

<p>The amount of notice you are entitled to by law will depend on how long you
have been working for your employer.</p>

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Duration of employment</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Minimum notice</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">13 weeks to 2 years</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1 week</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2 years to 5 years</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2 weeks</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">5 years to 10 years</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">4 weeks</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">10 years to 15 years</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">6 weeks</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">15 years or more</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">8 weeks</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>While the notice entitlements under your contract of employment can exceed
the minimim periods above, any provision for notice in your contract for less
then the above is invalid. This essentially means that while your contract of
employment can set down that you will receive a greater amount of notice than
the law states above, you cannot get less, even if your contract says this.</p>

<h3>Payment instead of notice</h3>

<p>You may be required to work the notice period or you may accept payment in
lieu of notice, if offered. Payment in lieu of notice means that you will not
have to work for the period between receiving notice and the ending of your
employment, but you will get the same amount of wages that you would have
received, had you worked. This payment is not regarded as wages or salary but
as <a href="../../retirement/income_tax_in_retirement/retirement_lump_sum_taxation.html">compensation
for loss of employment</a>, which may qualify for tax relief. However, if your
contract of employment provides for a payment of this kind on termination of
the contract or if you work for the period of notice, you pay tax and PRSI in
the normal way.</p>

<p>If you get payment in lieu of notice you are considered to be unemployed and
available for work during this period. This means that you can claim a <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/signing_on.html">jobseeker’s
payment</a>. You cannot claim a jobseeker’s payment for any day that you are
receiving holiday pay (see below).</p>

<p>If you are accepting payment in lieu of notice, the date on your P45 is the
date that you physically leave the job. For tax and social welfare purposes
your employment has ceased. This allows you to claim social welfare benefits.
However, the P45 does not prove the termination date of your employment for the
purposes of employment law. Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1973/en/act/pub/0004/sec0007.html#zza4y1973s7">section
7</a> of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973, if you accept
payment in lieu of notice, then the date of termination of your employment is
the date on which notice (if it had been given) would have expired.</p>

<p>During your period of notice you should receive your normal pay. This also
applies if you are paid in lieu of notice.</p>

<h3>Waiving your right to notice</h3>

<p>Employment legislation sets down that if an employer and an employee agree,
the employee can waive their right to notice. In addition, where the employer
and employee agree, the employer can pay the employee in lieu of notice. This
right is set down in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1973/en/act/pub/0004/sec0007.html#zza4y1973s7">Section
7</a> of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973.</p>

<h3>Dismissal without notice</h3>

<p>Your employer <span>may dismiss you without notice</span> for serious
misconduct, although you can contest whether your employer was justified in
such action.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lec788">Pay </h2>

<p>If you lose your job you have certain rights and entitlements including the
right to be paid for work you have done. <a href="../../employment_rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/leaving_work_without_being_paid.html">If
you have not been paid by the date of dismissal</a> or if you are still owed
some wages, you have a legal entitlement to be paid for your work. </p>

<p><strong>Holiday pay:</strong> If your employment is ending, you are entitled
to receive a payment for annual leave which you have earned but not taken. The
payment should equal the amount that would have been paid had the annual leave
been taken. The ending of employment is the only situation where it is legal to
pay an employee instead of giving annual leave.</p>

<p><strong>Public holiday:</strong> If your employment stops during the week
ending on the day before a public holiday and you have worked for your employer
for the previous 4 weeks, you should receive an additional day's pay for the
public holiday. This also applies to part-time employees who have established a
right to the public holiday by working at least 40 hours in the previous 5
weeks.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>Your employer is responsible for giving you your proper notice. If you have
difficulty in securing your notice entitlement or if there is a dispute about
pay you are owed, your payslip or pay for annual leave you can refer a
complaint to the <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace
Relations Commission</a> within 6 months of the dispute or complaint occurring.
You must use the online complaint form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.
The time limit may be extended for up to a further 6 months, but only where
there is reasonable cause which prevented the complaint being brought within
the normal time limit. </p>

<p>For further information on your employment rights contact the Workplace
Relations Commission's <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Workplace_Relations_Services/Info_Cust_Serv/">Information
and Customer Service</a> - see 'Where to apply' below.</p>

<p>If you are not given a P45 when you leave your job you should first ask your
employer for it. If the employer does not supply it you should contact your <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/contact/index.html">tax office.</a>
Revenue will contact the employer and obtain your P45 for you. If you have
started a new job, Revenue will send you a new tax credit certificate so you
will not have to pay emergency tax in your new job.</p>

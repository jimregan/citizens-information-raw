<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>There are several support systems for students with disabilities who are
undertaking courses at third level. Many third-level colleges have a disability
or access service which is responsible for giving support and advice to
students with disabilities - see 'How to apply' below.</p>

<p>The Association for Higher Education Access and Disability (AHEAD) is a
voluntary organisation that promotes the participation of students with
disabilities in third-level education. The AHEAD website has a range of
information about <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ahead.ie/commonsupports">educational supports for students
with disabilities at third level</a>. There is also information about <a href="http://www.ahead.ie/accessingcollege">accessing college</a>. </p>

<p>The AHEAD website also has a list of other <a href="http://www.ahead.ie/studentservices">student services</a>.</p>

<h3>Telling the college about your disability</h3>

<p>If you have a disability, a specific learning difficulty or a significant
ongoing illness, you can let the third-level institution know about it - either
during the application process or at any time during your course - so that they
can consider, in consultation with yourself, any specific support needs you may
have in college. If you choose to give this information during the application
process (though you are not obliged to do this) you should tick the relevant
box on your application form to the Central Applications Office (CAO). Giving
this information on the form will not adversely affect your application in any
way. In fact, it is by ticking this box that you get the option of the
Disability Access Route to Education - see below.</p>

<p></p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l529b1">Application procedures for students with a
disability</h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.accesscollege.ie/dare/index.php">Disability Access Route to
Education</a> (DARE) aims to improve access to college for school-leavers with
a disability or specific learning difficulty by allocating a number of
third-level places to them on a reduced points basis. To be eligible for the
scheme you must provide evidence that your disability has affected your
educational performance significantly – see ‘Supplementary Information
Form’ below. </p>

<p>You must also be aged under 23 on 1 January 2017.</p>

<h3>How the scheme works</h3>

<p>Each of the third-level colleges participating in the scheme has reserved a
number of course places for school-leavers who are eligible for DARE. You can
find details of the places available through DARE on the <a shape="rect" href="http://accesscollege.ie/dare/participating-colleges/">websites of the
participating third-level colleges.</a> </p>

<p>You apply for DARE through the Central Applications Office (CAO) – see
‘How to apply’ below. Once you have been accepted as eligible for DARE, you
then compete for the reduced point places based on your Leaving Certificate
results. A <em>reduced point </em>place means that you may get a place on a
third-level course with fewer than the full CAO points. For example, if you are
eligible for DARE and you get 350 Leaving Certificate points, you may be
offered a place on a course that requires 360 points through the standard CAO
procedure. However, you must meet the college matriculation requirements and
any specific course entry requirements.</p>

<h3>Additional supports</h3>

<p>Whether you apply for college through DARE or through the standard CAO
procedure, there is a range of supports for student with disabilities while
they are at college. The supports available vary from college to college but
may include: an orientation programme; study skills and extra tuition if
required; access to assistive technology and training; mentoring.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l1cfa9">Supplementary Information Form</h2>

<p>To be eligible for DARE you must provide additional information on the
Supplementary Information Form (SIF). </p>

<p>If you tick the box on the online CAO form that asks if you have a
disability or specific learning difficulty, you will be directed to the online
Supplementary Information Form. If you are making a paper application, you can
request a paper version of the Supplementary Information Form. </p>

<p>The form has 3 sections as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Section A</strong> asks for information on your disability and if
    you wish to be considered for DARE. </li>
  <li><strong>Section B</strong> is a <a shape="rect" href="http://accesscollege.ie/dare/forms-guides-resources/">Educational
    Impact Statement</a>, to be completed by your school. It provides
    information about your educational experience and assists the decision
    about the third-level supports you need. </li>
  <li><strong>Section C</strong> is <a shape="rect" href="http://accesscollege.ie/dare/forms-guides-resources/">Evidence of
    Disability</a> which must be completed by the <a shape="rect" href="http://accesscollege.ie/dare/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/12/Guide-to-Providing-Evidence-of-Your-Disability-2016.pdf">accepted
    medical consultant or specialist</a> for your particular disability. It
    provides verification of your disability and helps the decision about the
    third-level supports that you need. </li>
</ul></div>

<p><strong>Supports for students with disabilities</strong></p>

<p>If you have indicated on your CAO form that you have a disability or
specific learning difficulty, the college's <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ahead.ie/yourdisabilityoffice">Disability Service</a> will be
informed as soon as you accept a place, and they will get in touch with you to
work out what supports they can provide.</p>

<p>Even if you didn't tick this box on the CAO form, you can still access the
available supports by contacting the college's Disability Service at any stage
during your time in college.</p>

<p><strong>DARE admission route</strong></p>

<p>If you wish to apply for a college place under the DARE scheme you should
apply through the Central Applications Office (CAO). When you are filling in
the CAO form online you must complete the part of the form to say that you have
a disability or specific learning difficulty. You will then be directed to the
separate online Supplementary Information Form. </p>

<p>If you prefer, you can contact the CAO and ask for paper versions of the
main form and the Supplementary Information Form. </p>

<p>Sections B and C can only be sent to the CAO in paper form. The CAO advises
all students to get a certificate of posting when sending documents by post.</p>

<p><strong>Key dates for 2017 applications using DARE</strong></p>

<p><strong>4 November 2016</strong> - the online CAO application facility for
2017 opens.</p>

<p><strong>1 February 2017</strong> - your main application (online or paper)
must reach the CAO by 5.15 p.m.</p>

<p><strong>1 March 2017 </strong>-<strong></strong> the following 3 items must
reach the CAO by 5.15 p.m.</p>
<ul><li>Tick the box on the main CAO form that indicates you have a disability or
    specific learning difficulty. </li>
  <li>Complete Section A of the Supplementary Information Form. </li>
  <li>Indicate that you wish to be considered for DARE by ticking 'Yes' on
    question 1. </li>
</ul><p><strong>1 April 2017</strong>, the rest of the Supplementary Information
Form must reach the CAO by 5.15 p.m. These are:</p>
<ul><li>Section B (the Educational Impact Statement) </li>
  <li>Section C (evidence of a disability)</li>
</ul><p><strong>No applications will be accepted after these closing dates</strong>.
The closing dates are very strict because DARE is an additional application
procedure which needs extra processing time.</p>

<p>You be notified by post by the end of <strong>June 2017</strong> (after the
Leaving Certificate exam) telling you whether you are eligible for the DARE
scheme. If you are told you are not eligible you can ask for your application
to be reviewed. If you are not eligible for DARE you can still get into college
if you meet the entry requirements for your chosen course.</p>

<p>The CAO helpline at (091) 509 800 can help you with your DARE application.
You can find further information in this list of <a shape="rect" href="http://accesscollege.ie/dare/frequently-asked-questions/">frequently
asked questions</a> on the <a shape="rect" href="http://accesscollege.ie/dare/">Access College website</a>. You can also
contact the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ahead.ie/yourdisabilityoffice">access services of the colleges
participating in the DARE scheme</a>. </p>

<p>The DARE programme runs nationwide <a shape="rect" href="http://accesscollege.ie/dare/events/">information sessions</a> for
students and their parents/guardians to deal with queries about preparing the
application. </p>

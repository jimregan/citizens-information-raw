protection) who are living in Ireland may apply for a travel document to allow
them to travel outside Ireland. </p>
</div>
You can find <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Application_for_a_Travel_Document">information
about travel documents</a> on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and
Immigration Service.<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

travel document if you:</p>

    of 1951</li>

  document)</li>
  <li>Have been declared a Programme refugee in accordance with section 24 of
    the Refugee Act 1996 as amended</li>
</ul><p>If you have refugee status or subsidiary protection, you may travel freely
in and out of the state with this document. You may travel to most EU states
with this document without the need to obtain a visa. However, some countries
require a visa, so it is always advisable to check with the embassy of
whichever country you intend travelling to about visa requirements. You do not
require a re-entry visa to come back into Ireland.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>Your children need their own travel document. An application for a child
must be accompanied by the child’s birth certificate and evidence that the
child is resident in Ireland. Travel documents for children aged from 5 to 17
years are valid for up to 10 years. A travel document for a child aged under 5
is valid for up to 5 years.</p>

<h3>Alternative travel document</h3>

<p>If you have do not have refugee status or subsidiary protection but have
been granted permission to remain in Ireland, you should apply for a passport
to the embassy of your country. In some exceptional cases people who have been
granted permission to remain and who do not have a passport, may be issued with
an alternative travel document by the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>

<p>If you are issued with an alternative travel document, it will be valid
until the expiry date of your Certificate of Registration (GNIB card). You must
obtain a <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Re-entry%20visas">re-entry visa</a>
before you leave the State otherwise you may have difficulties re-entering. You
also need a visa to enter other EU countries. </p>

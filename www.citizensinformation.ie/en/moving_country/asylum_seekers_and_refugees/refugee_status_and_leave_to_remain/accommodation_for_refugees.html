<p>Accommodation is provided for Programme refugees when they arrive in the
State. This accommodation may be in a reception centre, a bed and breakfast, a
hotel, a hostel, a house, a flat or an apartment.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l2d996">Convention refugees, people given subsidiary
protection or permission to remain</h2>

<p>If you have been granted <a shape="rect" href="../the_asylum_process_in_ireland/refugees_asylum_seekers_introduction.html">international
protection (refugee status or subsidiary protection) or permission to
remain</a> and you have been living in a direct provision accommodation centre,
you will have to leave that centre and move into other accommodation. This may
be in social housing (public housing) or in private rented housing. You can now
move to live in any part of the State that you wish. If you were already living
in private rented accommodation, your change of status will not affect your
immediate housing circumstances. </p>

<p>You can read more information about finding accommodation in this <a href="http://www.ria.gov.ie/en/RIA/GuidetoLivingIndependently.pdf/Files/GuidetoLivingIndependently.pdf">guide
to living independently (pdf)</a> for people who have been granted refugee
status or subsidiary protection or permission to remain.</p>

<h3>Social housing</h3>

<p>Local authorities are the main providers of social housing for people who
cannot afford to buy their own homes. Local authority housing is allocated
according to eligibility and need. Rents are based on the household’s ability
to pay. Housing associations and housing co-operatives also provide social
housing for people who cannot afford to buy their own homes.</p>

<p>You should register at the office of your local authority to go on the <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/local_authority_and_social_housing/applying_for_local_authority_housing.html">waiting
list for housing</a>. The local authorities have a number of housing options
depending on your income level and housing need.</p>

<h3>Private rented housing</h3>

<p>If you do not qualify for social housing or if there is a long waiting list
for social housing, you should consider living in private rented accommodation,
which you will have to find yourself. You may qualify for financial help with
paying the rent under one of the following schemes:</p>
<ul><li>The <a href="../../../housing/renting_a_home/housing_assistance_payment.html">Housing
    Assistance Payment (HAP)</a> is being introduced as a form of social
    housing support for people who have a long-term housing need. It is being
    administered by local authorities – see ‘Where to apply’ below.</li>
  <li>If you live in a county where HAP is not yet available, a <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
    Supplement</a> may be paid by your local Department of Social Protection's
    representative (formerly known as the Community Welfare Officer) if you do
    not have the means to pay for the rent yourself. When you find a house or
    flat to rent you should apply to the Department's representative for Rent
    Supplement – see 'Where to apply' below.</li>
</ul><p>The Residential Tenancies Board has published a <a href="http://prtb.ie/docs/default-source/tenant-guides/good-tenant-guide.pdf?sfvrsn=2">guide
on being a good tenant (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Homeless</h3>

<p>If you find yourself homeless or you think you may lose your home, you
should generally contact your local authority to access accommodation. In
Dublin and Cork, the local authorities and the Department of Social Protection
provide dedicated services for homeless people. Our document on <a href="../../../housing/losing_your_home/agencies_for_homeless_people.html">agencies
that provide services for homeless people</a> gives details of where to apply
for the various supports.</p>

<h3>Buying a home</h3>

<p>If you have sufficient finance and a regular income, you can apply for a
mortgage to <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/owning_a_home/">buy a house</a>.</p>

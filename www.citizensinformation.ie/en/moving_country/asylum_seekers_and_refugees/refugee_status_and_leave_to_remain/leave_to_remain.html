<p>Foreign nationals <a shape="rect" href="../../moving_to_ireland/rights_of_residence_in_ireland/residence_rights_eu_national.html">other
than EEA and Swiss nationals</a> need permission to live in Ireland. There are
different <a href="../../moving_to_ireland/rights_of_residence_in_ireland/types_residence_permission_non_eea_nationals.html">types
of permission for non-EEA nationals</a> including those for <a href="../../moving_to_ireland/studying_in_ireland/immigration_nonEEA_students.html">students</a>
and those who are <a href="../../../employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/overview_employment_permits.html">working
in Ireland</a>. Other non-EEA nationals who have permission to remain in
Ireland are those who have been granted <a href="../the_asylum_process_in_ireland/refugees_asylum_seekers_introduction.html">refugee
status or subsidiary protection.</a> One specific type of permission to live in
Ireland is known as <em>permission to remain.</em> This is a status that is
granted at the discretion of the Minister for Justice and Equality. Leave to
remain may be granted to people who have been <a shape="rect" href="../the_asylum_process_in_ireland/if_your_application_for_refugee_status_is_refused.html">refused
a refugee or subsidiary protection declaration</a> but who are not returned
home for humanitarian or other compelling reasons. </p>

<h3>People given permission to remain</h3>

<p>A person who has been refused a refugee or subsidiary protection declaration
may be granted permission to remain in the State. A person may also withdraw
from the asylum process and seek permission to remain in the State. Permission
to remain is granted at the discretion of the Minister for Justice and
Equality, usually on humanitarian grounds. </p>

<p>There are 2 groups of asylum seekers who may be given permission to remain
in the State:</p>

<p><strong>People who withdraw from the asylum process</strong></p>

<p>In general, people who withdraw from the asylum process and seek permission
to remain are those who marry or enter into a civil partnership with an Irish
citizen and those who marry or enter into a civil partnership an EU citizen.</p>

<p><strong>People who were refused a declaration</strong></p>

<p>If the International Protection Office has made a recommendation that they
should be <a href="../the_asylum_process_in_ireland/if_your_application_for_refugee_status_is_refused.html">refused
a refugee or subsidiary protection declaration,</a> and this recommendation has
not been overturned by the International Protection Appeals Tribunal, the <a href="../the_asylum_process_in_ireland/minister_for_justice.html">Minister
may consider whether they should be given permission to remain in the
State</a>.</p>

<h3>Parents of Irish citizen children</h3>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP09000196">Irish
Born Child Scheme (IBC/05)</a> a number of non-EEA national parents of children
born in the State prior to 1 January 2005 were granted permission to remain for
an initial period of 2 years. Many of them had their permission to remain
extended subject to certain conditions in 2007, 2010 and 2013. From 1 October
2015, there is a new <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP07000030">application
procedure</a> to renew their permission to remain – see 'How to apply'
below.</p>

<p>On 8 March 2011 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in the Zambrano
case <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&amp;Submit=rechercher&amp;numaff=C-34/09">C
34/09</a>, that an EU member state may not refuse the non-EU parents of a
dependent child who is a citizen of, and resident in, an EU member state the
right to live and work in that member state. Non-EEA parents who meet the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP16000113">Zambrano criteria</a>
may be given permission to live and work in Ireland without the requirement for
an employment permit or business permission.</p>

<p>From 1 October 2015, there is a new <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP07000030">application
procedure</a> for non-EEA parents applying for permission to remain based on
parentage of an Irish citizen child – see 'How to apply' below.</p>

<h3>Rights of people granted permission to remain</h3>

<p>Persons granted permission to remain do not have all of the <a shape="rect" href="rights_of_convention_programme_refugees_people_given_leave_to_remain.html">same
rights as persons granted refugee or subsidiary protection status.</a> They
must have been resident in Ireland for 5 years before they are eligible to
apply for <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_citizenship/becoming_an_irish_citizen_through_naturalisation.html">Irish
citizenship</a>. They do not have the right to <a shape="rect" href="family_reunification_for_refugees_in_ireland.html">family
reunification</a> but anyone who is entitled to reside and remain in the State
may apply to the Minister to permit family members to join them. The Minister
for Justice and Equality can grant or refuse permission on a discretionary
basis. In addition, foreign national parents granted permission to remain under
the Irish Born Child Scheme (IBC/05) are not eligible for maintenance grants or
free fees for third-level education. </p>

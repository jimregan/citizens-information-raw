<h2>Information</h2>

<p>All children and young people, including those granted international
protection (refugee status or subsidiary protection) or permission to remain
are entitled to free <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_primary_school/types_primary_school.html">primary</a>
and <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_post_primary_school/types_of_post_primary_school.html">post-primary</a>
education. </p>

<p>People who have been granted refugee or subsidiary protection status have
the right to access education and training in the like manner and to the like
extent in all respects as an Irish citizen. While it is not set out in
legislation, people given humanitarian leave to remain in the State are
normally conferred with most of the same rights and privileges, including the
right to education, as those <a shape="rect" href="rights_of_convention_programme_refugees_people_given_leave_to_remain.html">conferred
on refugees</a>.</p>

<p>You can read more about the Irish education system in this <a href="http://www.ria.gov.ie/en/RIA/GuidetoLivingIndependently.pdf/Files/GuidetoLivingIndependently.pdf">guide
to living independently for people who have been granted refugee status or
subsidiary protection or permission to remain (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Early childhood education</h3>

<p>Early childhood education generally means education before the start of
formal schooling. It covers the period from birth to 6 years. It is available
in pre-schools, playgroups and daycare services.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../education/pre_school_education_and_childcare/early_childhood_education.html">Early
Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme</a> gives children access to a
limited amount of free care and education before they start school.</p>

<h3>Primary and secondary education</h3>

<p>All children are required to be educated from the age of 6 to 16 (or until
they have completed 3 years of second-level education). </p>

<p>On completing <a href="../../../education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_primary_school/primary_education_life_event.html">primary
education</a>, the students then transfer to <a href="../../../education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_post_primary_school/post_primary_education_life_event.html">post-primary
(second-level)</a> education. They join the <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_post_primary_school/junior_cycle.html">Junior
Cycle</a> of secondary education, which lasts 3 years. At the end of this
cycle, students present themselves for the <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/state_examinations/junior_certificate_programme.html">Junior
Certificate Examination</a>. Students then continue into the <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_post_primary_school/senior_cycle.html">Senior
Cycle</a>, which lasts 2 or 3 years and leads to students presenting for the <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/state_examinations/established_leaving_certificate.html">Leaving
Certificate Examination</a>. </p>

<p>Children with <a href="../../../education/the_irish_education_system/special_education.html">special
educational needs</a> because of a disability get extra support either in their
own school or in special schools.</p>

<p>Corporal punishment is prohibited in Irish schools. There are <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/educational_supports/non_nationals_and_non_english_speakers.html">extra
resources in schools for non-English-speaking children</a>. Children may have
free access to mother tongue supports. </p>

<p>Adults may have access to English language classes and to adult literacy
which are provided by the <a href="http://www.etbi.ie/etbs/directory-of-etbs/">local Education and Training
Board (ETB)</a>. The availability and duration of these classes is decided by
the local ETB. </p>

<h3>Further education</h3>

<p>People with refugee status or subsidiary protection, with humanitarian leave
to remain or leave to remain as the parents of an Irish-born child can access
approved <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/vocational_education_and_training/training_and_apprentiship_programmes/post_leaving_certificate_courses.html">PLC
courses</a>. They may also participate in the <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/returning_to_education/vocational_training_opportunities_scheme.html">Vocational
Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS)</a> provided they meet the normal VTOS
requirements. You can read more about <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/Further-Education-and-Training/Post-Leaving-Certificate-PLC-Programme/fe_non-nationals.pdf">access
to further education courses for non-EU nationals here</a>.</p>

<h3>Third level education</h3>

<p>People with refugee status or subsidiary protection and those with
humanitarian leave to remain are entitled to <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/third_level_education/fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/fees.html">free
third-level (university or college) education</a> if they have been living in
Ireland for 3 years or more. They also may be entitled to <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/third_level_education/fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/maintenance_grant_schemes_for_students_on_third_level_courses.html">third
level maintenance grants</a>. Information about <a href="http://www.studentfinance.ie/mp9377/course-fees/index.html">their
entitlement to free fees is on studentfinance.ie</a>.</p>

entitled to free fees or maintenance grants.</p>

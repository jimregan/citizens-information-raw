<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you have been granted international protection (refugee status or
subsidiary protection) you have the right to receive the same medical care and
services and the same social welfare benefits as an Irish citizen. </p>

<p>The Department of Justice and Equality has published a <a href="http://www.ria.gov.ie/en/RIA/GuidetoLivingIndependently.pdf/Files/GuidetoLivingIndependently.pdf">guide
to living independently (pdf)</a> for people who have been granted refugee
status or subsidiary protection or permission to remain </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lc0da8">Medical services</h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../services_for_asylum_seekers_in_ireland/medical_services_and_entitlements_for_asylum_seekers.html">medical
services you received as an asylum seeker</a> will continue if you have been
granted refugee status or subsidiary protection or permission to remain, as
there is no difference in the provision for asylum seekers and people with
refugee status or subsidiary protection or permission to remain. </p>

<p>The receptionist at the local health centre (see 'Where to apply' below)
will provide you with a medical card application form, which you should
complete and return to the <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">Local Health Office</a> as
soon as possible. The medical card allows you and your family to access medical
services free of charge. If you do not apply for and receive a medical card,
you will be asked to pay for certain medical services. When you apply for a <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical
card</a>, you choose a doctor that is taking part in the scheme and ask the
doctor to sign your application form to accept you as a patient. Contact your
Local Health Office for details of GPs in your area. </p>

<p>A medical card issued by the Health Service Executive enables you to receive
free general practitioner services; <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/prescribed_drugs_and_medicines.html">prescribed
drugs and medicines</a> (some prescription charges apply); <a href="../../../health/hospital_services/hospital_services_introduction.html">in-patient
public hospital services; out-patient public hospital services</a>; dental,
optical and aural health services; medical appliances; <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/women_s_health/maternity_and_infant_welfare_services.html">maternity
and infant care services</a>; a maternity cash grant of â‚¬10.16 on the birth
of each child and psychological services for those traumatised by torture, rape
or other critical life experiences,</p>
<ul><li>A Local Health Office may have waiting lists for these services and may
    have to give priority on the basis of medical need. </li>
  <li>If you are pregnant or have small children, you should contact the local
    <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/care_in_your_community/public_health_nurses.html">public
    health nurse</a> at your local health centre. The nurse will keep in touch
    with you during your pregnancy and after the birth of your child and will
    offer help and advice. </li>
  <li>If your income is too high to allow you avail of a medical card, you are
    entitled to general <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/hospital_services/hospital_services_introduction.html">hospital
    services</a>. Other services, such as GP services, must be paid for. It is
    possible to take out <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/health_insurance/private_health_insurance.html">medical
    insurance</a> to cover you and your family's medical needs. </li>
</ul></div>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="ldd3ac">Social welfare entitlements</h2>

<p>If you have refugee status or subsidiary protection you are entitled to
apply for social welfare payments on the same basis as an Irish citizen. Each
social welfare payment has rules and conditions attached. You will satisfy the
<a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitual
residence condition</a>, but you will have to meet other conditions. There is a
broad range of social welfare entitlements. Your local social welfare office or
Intreo centre will help you to apply for the correct payment for your situation
- see 'Where to apply' below.</p>

<p>If you have been granted <a shape="rect" href="leave_to_remain.html">permission to remain,</a> you are entitled to apply
for social welfare payments as above. However, if you are getting a social
welfare payment this may affect the renewal of your permission to remain or an
application for citizenship. </p>

<p>The following are some examples of social welfare payments: </p>
<ul><li>You have the right to work, so if you are able to work but are currently
    unemployed, you can apply for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
    Allowance</a>. </li>
  <li>If you are unable to work due to disability or illness you can apply for
    <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability
    Allowance</a>. </li>
  <li>If you are parenting alone you can apply for the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent
    Family Payment</a>.</li>
  <li>If you are the parent or guardian of a child you can apply for <a shape="rect" href="../../../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child
    Benefit</a>. </li>
</ul><p>While waiting for a decision on your application for a social welfare
payment, you can apply for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary
Welfare Allowance.</a> Apply to the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/otheroffice/community-welfare-office-contact.aspx">Department
of Social Protection's representative</a> (formerly the Community Welfare
Officer).</p>

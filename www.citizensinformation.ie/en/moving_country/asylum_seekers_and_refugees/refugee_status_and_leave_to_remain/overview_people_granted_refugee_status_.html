<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Asylum seekers who have been granted <a href="../the_asylum_process_in_ireland/refugees_asylum_seekers_introduction.html">international
protection (refugee status or subsidiary protection) or permission to
remain</a> have the right to live and work in Ireland. In most cases, this will
mean leaving direct provision accommodation to find work and somewhere to live.
The change from direct provision to living independently may involve a number
of issues including housing, employment, health services, managing money and
social welfare.</p>

<h3>Housing</h3>

<p>If you have been living in a direct provision accommodation centre, you will
have to leave that centre and <a href="accommodation_for_refugees.html">move
into other accommodation</a>. This could be in <a href="../../../housing/local_authority_and_social_housing/applying_for_local_authority_housing.html">social
housing (public housing)</a> or in <a href="../../../housing/renting_a_home/looking_for_a_flat_or_house_to_rent.html">private
rented housing</a>. If you were already living in private rented accommodation,
your change of status will not affect your immediate housing situation.</p>

<p>If you find yourself <a href="../../../housing/losing_your_home/">homeless</a>, there are <a href="../../../housing/losing_your_home/agencies_for_homeless_people.html">agencies
that provide services for homeless people</a>.</p>

<h3>Social welfare</h3>

<p>When you are granted refugee status or subsidiary protection or permission
to remain, you should apply for <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment_1.html">any
social welfare payments</a> for which you are eligible. You will satisfy the <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitual
residence condition</a>, but you will have to meet other conditions. Your local
<a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/ContactUs/Pages/localoffice.aspx">social
welfare office or Intreo centre</a> will help you to apply for the correct
payment for your situation. For example:</p>
<ul><li>If you are able to work but are unemployed, you may get <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseekerâ€™s
    Allowance</a>. Our <a href="../../../reference/checklists/checklist_entitlements_and_services_for_unemployed_people.html">checklist
    for unemployed people</a> has links to information about services and
    entitlements for unemployed people.</li>
  <li>If you are unable to work due to disability or illness, you can apply for
    <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability
    Allowance</a>. You can also find out more in our <a href="../../../reference/checklists/checklist_disability.html">checklist
    of the main services and entitlements for people with disabilities</a>.</li>
  <li>If you are the parent or guardian of a child you can apply for <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child
    Benefit</a>. If you need childcare, you can view our <a href="../../../reference/checklists/checklist_childcare.html">childcare
    checklist</a>.</li>
  <li>If you are parenting alone you can apply for <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent
    Family Payment</a>. You can find out more in our <a href="../../../reference/checklists/checklist_entitlements_for_lone_parents.html">checklist
    of the main services and entitlements for people parenting alone</a>.</li>
</ul><h3>Employment</h3>

<p>You have the right to work, so you may find our document on <a href="../../../employment/starting_work_and_changing_job/training_and_looking_for_work/finding_and_getting_a_job.html">looking
for work and getting a job</a> helpful.</p>

<p>Your local <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Intreo---Contact-Information.aspx">Intreo
centre</a> or <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Employment-Services-Offices.aspx">employment
services office</a> provides <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Employment-Advice-and-Support.aspx">information
and advice for jobseekers</a>, including a list of job vacancies. The <a href="http://www.jobsireland.ie/">Jobs Ireland website</a> lists jobs that are
available. It also lists <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/schemes_to_support_employment.html">employment
support scheme</a> vacancies.</p>

<p>When you do <a href="../../../employment/starting_work_and_changing_job/training_and_looking_for_work/employment_life_event.html">find
work</a>, you should find out about your <a href="../../../employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/">employment
rights</a>, which are protected by <a href="../../../employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/employment_rights_and_duties/employment_law_update.html">employment
law</a>. Specific legislation exists to protect your <a href="../../../justice/law_and_rights/irish_human_rights_commission.html">human
rights and ensure equality at work</a> and there are procedures to assist you
to <a href="../../../employment/enforcement_and_redress/enforcing_your_employment_rights.html">enforce
your employment rights</a>.</p>

<h3>Health services</h3>

<p>The <a href="copy_of_medical_services_and_entitlements_for_refugees_and_asylum_seekers.html">medical
services</a> you received as an asylum seeker will continue if you have been
granted refugee status or subsidiary protection or permission to remain. The <a href="../../../health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical
card</a> gives you and your family access to medical services free of charge
(some <a href="../../../health/drugs_and_medicines/prescription_charges_for_medical_card_holders.html">prescription
charges</a> apply). If you do not qualify for a medical card, you will be asked
to pay for certain medical services. Contact your <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">Local Health Office</a> for
details of GPs (family doctors) in your area.</p>

<h3>Education</h3>

<p>All children and young people, including those granted refugee status or
subsidiary protection or permission to remain, are entitled to free <a href="../../../education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_primary_school/types_primary_school.html">primary</a>
and <a href="../../../education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_post_primary_school/types_of_post_primary_school.html">post-primary</a>
education. You can read more about this and about further and third-level
education in our document on <a href="education_for_refugees.html">education
for people with refugee status or subsidiary protection or permission to
remain</a>.</p>

<p>If you are unemployed there are different <a href="../../../employment/starting_work_and_changing_job/training_and_looking_for_work/looking_for_work_education_and_training.html">education
and training opportunities</a> that include courses specifically for unemployed
people.</p>

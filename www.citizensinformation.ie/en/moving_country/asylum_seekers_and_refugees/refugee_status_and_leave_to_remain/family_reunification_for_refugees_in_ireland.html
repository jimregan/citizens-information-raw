<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>A person who has international protection (refugee status or subsidiary
protection) in Ireland can apply to the Minister for Justice and Equality for
permission to have a member of their family enter and live in the State. Since
31 December 2016, <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/enacted/en/html">the
International Protection Act 2015</a> sets out their right to apply for family
reunification.</p>

<p>Under sections 56 and 57 of the Act, you may apply to the Minister if you
have a current declaration as a convention refugee or a programme refugee or if
you have a current subsidiary protection declaration.</p>

<p>People with <a href="leave_to_remain.html">permission to remain</a> do
not have a right to family reunification. However, they may apply to have a
member of their family join them in Ireland. There is no legal definition as to
who is a member of the family for people with permission to remain. However, it
is likely that such a definition would be similar to that of a person with
refugee status or subsidiary protection. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l6f552">Family members</h2>

<p>A member of the family in relation to a person who has refugee status or
subsidiary protection (known as “the sponsor”) means: </p>
<ul><li><span>Spouse or civil partner – provided that the marriage or civil
    partnership is in existence when the application for international
    protection is made</span></li>
  <li><span>Parent(s) – if the sponsor is aged under 18 and is not married on
    the date the application for family reunification is made</span></li>
  <li><span>Parents’ children (aged under 18 and not married) if the sponsor
    is aged under 18 and not married on the date the application for family
    reunification is made</span></li>
  <li><span>Child who is aged under 18 and not married on the date the
    application for family reunification is made</span></li>
</ul><p>You must apply within 12 months of being granted a refugee or a subsidiary
protection declaration or from the date of your arrival in Ireland as a
programme refugee.</p>

<p>You apply for permission for your family member (s) either:</p>
<ul><li>To enter and reside in the State if they are living outside the State</li>
</ul><p>or</p>
<ul><li>To reside in the State if they are already in the State on the date of
    your application</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>A sponsor in Ireland who wishes to make an application to have a family
member join them must apply in writing to the Family Reunification Section of
the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) - see 'Where to apply'
below. Details of the documents required and the application process are in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Family_Reunification_Information_Leaflet">frequently
asked questions on family reunification</a> on the INIS website.</p>

<p>The sponsor will receive a letter from INIS informing them whether the
application was successful. If the request for family reunification has been
granted, the family member living abroad should then <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Apply%20for%20a%20visa%20%E2%80%93%20how%20to%20apply">apply
online for a visa</a> to join the family member in Ireland. There is <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP07000026">information about family
reunification for refugees on the INIS website.</a></p>

<p>The person who enters and resides in the State as a result of family
reunification is entitled to remain in the State and to the same <a href="rights_of_convention_programme_refugees_people_given_leave_to_remain.html">rights
and privileges as a person who has international protection</a> for as long as
the refugee or sponsor who made the application is entitled to remain in the
State. </p>

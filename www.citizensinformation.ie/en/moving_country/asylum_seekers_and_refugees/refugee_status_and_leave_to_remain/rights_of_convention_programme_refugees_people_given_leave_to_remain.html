<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/enacted/en/html">International
Protection Act 2015</a>, which came into effect on 31 December 2016, there are
2 types of international protection – refugee status and subsidiary
protection. If the Minister for Justice and Equality gives you a <a href="../the_asylum_process_in_ireland/refugees_asylum_seekers_introduction.html">refugee
or subsidiary protection declaration or permission to remain in Ireland</a>,
you are entitled to certain rights. The rights for people with refugee status
or subsidiary protection are different from those for people granted permission
to remain in the State – see below.</p>

<p>If you have previously been granted refugee status under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1996/act/17/enacted/en/html">Refugee
Act 1996</a>, as amended or subsidiary protection under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2013/si/426/made/en/print">European
Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013</a>, your rights are now set out
in the International Protection Act 2015, as described below.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice and Equality has published a <a href="http://www.ria.gov.ie/en/RIA/GuidetoLivingIndependently.pdf/Files/GuidetoLivingIndependently.pdf">guide
to living independently (pdf)</a> for people who have been granted refugee or
subsidiary protection status or permission to remain. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l608fa">International Protection Act 2015</h2>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/section/53/enacted/en/html#sec53">Section
53</a> of the International Protection Act 2015, people granted international
protection (refugee status or subsidiary protection) have:</p>
<ul><li>The right to seek and enter employment in the State</li>
  <li>The right to carry on any business, trade or profession in the State</li>
  <li>The right to access education and training in the like manner and to the
    like extent in all respects as an Irish citizen</li>
  <li>The right to receive the same medical care and services and the same
    social welfare benefits, including housing, as an Irish citizen</li>
  <li>The right to reside in the State for at least 3 years. This is renewable
    unless there are compelling reasons of national security or public order
    (ordre public) not to do so.</li>
  <li>The same rights of travel in, or to or from the State as those to which
    Irish citizens are entitled (note: this is on the basis that the Minister
    for Justice and Equality issues a travel document)</li>
  <li>The right to apply to the Minister for Justice and Equality for
    permission for a <a href="family_reunification_for_refugees_in_ireland.html">member of their
    family</a> to enter and reside in the State</li>
</ul><h3>Programme refugees</h3>

<p>Programme refugees will, for the period they are entitled to remain in the
State, have the same entitlement to the rights and privileges given to
Convention refugees. You can read more about these different terms for refugees
in our document, <a href="../the_asylum_process_in_ireland/refugees_and_asylum_seekers.html">Coming
to Ireland as an asylum seeker or refugee</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lca050">Permission to remain</h2>

<p>While it is not set out in legislation, people given <a shape="rect" href="leave_to_remain.html">permission to remain</a> in the State are normally
conferred with many of the same rights and privileges as those conferred on
Convention refugees. <span>They do not have the right to family
reunification</span> but anyone who is entitled to reside and remain in the
State may apply to the Minister for Justice and Equality to permit family
members or to join them. The Minister can grant or refuse permission on a
discretionary basis. </p>

<p>Free legal aid is available to asylum seekers in Ireland through the Legal
Aid Board to assist at all stages of the <a href="../the_asylum_process_in_ireland/applying_for_refugee_status_in_ireland.html">international
protection process</a>. This includes at the time of the initial application,
first interview and appeals. Alternatively, you may also engage the services of
a <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a> at
your own expense. You may also consult with the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees</a>. </p>

<p>The Legal Aid Board is an independent statutory body providing legal
services in civil matters.</p>

<p><span>The <a href="http://www.irishrefugeecouncil.ie/law-centre">Irish
Refugee Council Independent Law Centre</a> provides early legal advice and
representation to those in the early stages of the asylum process. </span></p>

<p><span>You should seek legal advice as early as possible in the process for
asylum.</span></p>

<h3>Civil legal aid and advice for asylum seekers</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.legalaidboard.ie/">Legal Aid Board</a>
provides confidential and independent <a href="http://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/Our-Services/Legal-Aid-Services/Services-for-international-protection-applicants/Services/General-Information/Legal-Services.html">legal
services to persons applying for asylum in Ireland</a>. The Board's civil legal
aid and advice scheme will assist with applications for asylum or subsidiary
protection and appeals to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. It will not assist you
with a judicial review of how the decision on your application was made but you
might be able to get civil legal aid for that separately.</p>

<p>To apply for legal aid and advice you must fill in an application form –
see ‘How to apply’ below. To qualify for legal aid you must pass a means
test - see 'Rules' below.</p>

<h3>Legal services provided</h3>

<p>A person who makes an application for legal services will be assisted as
soon as possible. The Legal Aid Board will provide assistance in the following
way:</p>
<ul><li>It will generally assist in applications for asylum by providing advice
    to you before you submit your questionnaire to the <a href="http://www.ipo.gov.ie/">International Protection Office</a> or before
    you attend your interview in the International Protection Office </li>
  <li>It can make written submissions to the International Protection Office in
    support of your application for asylum </li>
  <li>It can provide representation before the International Protection Appeals
    Tribunal </li>
  <li>Where an application for refugee status is refused, it can assist
    generally in the submission of applications in accordance with the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0017/index.html">Immigration
    Act 1999</a> and matters arising from this submission </li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Means test</h3>

<p>To qualify for legal services, your income, less certain allowances, must be
less than €18,000 and you must pay a minimum contribution of €10 for legal
advice and, if you need it, legal aid.</p>

<p>People who are only receiving social welfare payments will generally be
eligible for legal services at the minimum contribution. People in Direct
Provision may apply to have some of their contribution waived, which is at the
discretion of the Legal Aid Board. </p>

<h3>Requirements of people seeking assistance</h3>

<p>If you become a client of the Legal Aid Board you must:</p>
<ul><li>Keep the Legal Aid Board advised at all times of your current address.
  </li>
  <li>Attend at all appointments made for you with your caseworker or solicitor
    in the Legal Aid Board. Strict limits apply at all stages of the asylum
    process and failure to attend appointments on time may result in the Legal
    Aid Board being unable to provide a service to you. </li>

<h3>Medical screening</h3>

<p>A free medical screening service is available to all asylum seekers. </p>

<p>This service is completely confidential and independent of your application
for international protection (refugee status or subsidiary protection). </p>

<p>The service includes screening for certain infectious diseases such as TB,
Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV and checking the vaccination needs of you and
your family. The outcome of any medical tests you undergo will not affect your
application for a declaration of a refugee status in any way. There are a
number of reasons why you are advised to avail of medical screening. The
screening will identify and treat those who are ill and provide protection
against infectious diseases through immunisation. </p>

<p>Any necessary follow-up medical treatment will be provided for you and your
family free of charge under the medical card scheme. </p>

<p>It is in your interest to avail of this service and you can be assured that
this service is provided to you and your family in complete confidence.</p>

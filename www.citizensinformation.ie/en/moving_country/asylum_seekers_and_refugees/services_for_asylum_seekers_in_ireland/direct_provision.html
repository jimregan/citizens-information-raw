<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ria.gov.ie/">Reception and Integration
Agency</a>, which is under the Department of Justice and Equality, is
responsible for co-ordinating the services provided to asylum seekers in
Ireland. This is done in partnership with a number of State agencies, voluntary
and community groups and other non-governmental organisations. </p>

<p>On 30 June 2015, the Government published the <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR15000389">Report of the Working
Group on the Protection Process including Direct Provision and supports to
asylum seekers.</a> It includes over 170 recommendations, including
improvements to the conditions in accommodation for asylum seekers,
particularly for families and children.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lea0d5">Services and entitlements available to
you</h2>

<h3>Accommodation</h3>

<p>As a newly arrived asylum seeker, you are initially accommodated in a
<span>short-stay reception centre in the Dublin</span> area for a period of
assessment. You will then be <span>assigned accommodation at a regional
centre</span>. Such an assignment will take your particular needs into account.
</p>

<h3>Personal welfare entitlements</h3>

<p>Your <span>accommodation is full board</span>, which includes bed,
breakfast, lunch, and evening meal. This known as <em>direct provision.</em></p>

<p>Each adult will receive a personal allowance of €19.10 per week. Since 7
January 2016 the allowance for a child is €15.60 per week. </p>

<p>You may be entitled to assistance towards clothing when you arrive and to
other exceptional needs from time to time. The <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/how_health_is_organised/health_boards_and_community_welfare_officers.html">Department
of Social Protection's representative (formerly known as the Community Welfare
Officer)</a> will advise you on this. </p>

<p>You will not be entitled to Rent Supplement as your accommodation is paid
for.</p>

<h3>Medical services</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/how_health_is_organised/health_boards.html">Local Health
Office</a> will provide for your medical needs. The <acronym title="Community Welfare Officer">Department's representative</acronym> will
provide you with a medical card application form. The <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical
card</a> gives you and your family access to medical services free of charge.
You can read more about <a shape="rect" href="medical_services_and_entitlements_for_asylum_seekers.html">medical

<h3>Education</h3>

<p><strong>Primary and post-primary education: </strong>Information packs on <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_primary_school/primary_education_life_event.html">primary</a>
and <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_post_primary_school/post_primary_education_life_event.html">post-primary
education</a> are provided at the initial reception centre in Dublin to the
parents of children of school-going age before they are allocated to their
regional accommodation centre.</p>

<p>All children and young people, including young asylum seekers, are entitled
to free primary and post primary education. All children are required to remain
in school until they are 16 years of age. Most children <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_primary_school/primary_education_life_event.html">start
school</a> at 4 years of age and continue through primary school until they are
approximately 12 years old. Corporal punishment is prohibited in Irish
schools.</p>

<p>On completing primary education, the students then transfer to post-primary
or second-level education (more commonly called secondary education). They join
the <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_post_primary_school/junior_cycle.html">junior
cycle</a> of secondary education, which lasts 3 years. At the end of this cycle
students present themselves for the <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/state_examinations/junior_certificate_programme.html">Junior
Certificate Examination</a>. Students then continue into the <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_post_primary_school/senior_cycle.html">senior
cycle</a>, which lasts two or three years and leads to students presenting for
the <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/state_examinations/established_leaving_certificate.html">Leaving
Certificate Examination</a>. </p>

<p>Children may have free access to mother tongue supports.</p>

<p><strong>Further and higher education:</strong> In general, asylum seekers
are not entitled to free third-level (university or college) education. Under
the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Press-Events/Press-Releases/2016-Press-Releases/PR2016-03-05.html">Pilot
Support Scheme</a>, school leavers who have been in the protection system for 5
years and meet certain criteria can <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Learners/Services/Pilot-Support-Scheme/">apply
for student supports</a>. </p>

<p>Adults may have free access to <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/adult_and_life_long_education/adult_literacy.html">adult
literacy</a> and English language classes. Information on English classes can
be obtained from your local Education and Training Board (ETB) or local support
group.</p>

<h3>Work and vocational training</h3>

<p>In general, you are <span>not entitled to work</span> or attend vocational
training. You may, however, become involved in voluntary community activities.
</p>

<h3>Interpretation and translation services</h3>

<p>Interpretation and translation services will be provided where necessary.</p>

<h3>Local support groups</h3>

<p>Information on various local support groups, at or near your resettlement
destination, will also be available on request from the Reception and
Integration Agency. </p>

<p>Staff of the Agency will hold information meetings at your accommodation
centre on a regular basis.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Complaints</h3>

<p>If you are living within the direct provision system and you have a
complaint, you must first make your complaint to the manager of the
accommodation centre. You can find information on the complaints procedure in
the Reception and Integration Agency’s booklet <a href="http://www.ria.gov.ie/en/RIA/House%20Rules%20Revised%202015%20English.pdf/Files/House%20Rules%20Revised%202015%20English.pdf">Direct
Provision Reception and Accommodation Centres House rules and Procedures
(pdf)</a>. If you are unhappy with the way your complaint has been dealt with
by the manager of the accommodation centre, you can take your complaint to the
Reception and Integration Agency (RIA).</p>

<p>If you are still unhappy after the RIA’s examination, you can contact the
Office of the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman can examine <a href="http://www.ombudsman.gov.ie/en/Publications/Information-leaflets/Direct-Provision-Factsheet/">complaints
about certain actions or decisions</a> of accommodation centres and the
Reception and Integration Agency (RIA). The Ombudsman cannot examine decisions
about; asylum, citizenship, family reunification, residency or visas.</p>

<p>You should submit your complaint within 12 months of the action or decision
that has adversely affected you. However, even if more than 12 months has
passed, the Ombudsman may still be able to help if there is a good reason for
the delay.</p>

<p>If the complaint relates to a child or person under 18 years who has been
adversely affected by an action, or inaction, of the accommodation centre or
the RIA, you should complain to the <a href="https://www.oco.ie/complaints/">Ombudsman for Children’s Office
(OCO)</a>.</p>

</p>

<p>You are not allowed to seek alternative accommodation in the private rented

consecutive nights, the Reception and Integration Agency will deem your bed

indication that you do not wish to receive any aid or assistance from the
Agency.</p>

<p>House rules are posted in each accommodation centre. While you are a
resident in the centre, you will be expected to abide by these rules. You can
find the <a href="http://www.ria.gov.ie/en/RIA/House%20Rules%20Revised%202015%20English.pdf/Files/House%20Rules%20Revised%202015%20English.pdf">House
Rules and Procedures booklet (pdf)</a> including complaints procedures on the
Agency's website.</p>

children. To ensure the safety of the children and for the safety of others, it
is not permissible to leave children unattended at the accommodation centres.

involvement of the Child and Family Agency, which is obliged, under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0017/index.html">Child

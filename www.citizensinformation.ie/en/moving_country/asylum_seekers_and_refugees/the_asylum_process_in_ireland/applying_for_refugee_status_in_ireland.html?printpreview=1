<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/enacted/en/html">International
Protection Act 2015</a>, which came into effect on 31 December 2016, provides
for a single application procedure for international protection. It replaces
the earlier system, under which several applications could have been made.</p>

<p>Under the Act, a person who qualifies for international protection is “a
person who is either—</p>

<p>(a) a refugee and in relation to whom a refugee declaration is in force,
or</p>

<p>(b) a person eligible for subsidiary protection and in relation to whom a
subsidiary protection declaration is in force”</p>

<p>Under the Act, your application for international protection will be dealt
with as follows:</p>
<ul><li>At first instance, it will be handled by the International Protection
    Office (IPO), which will make a recommendation in relation to your case</li>
  <li>If the recommendation is negative and you are entitled to appeal, any
    such appeal will be dealt with by the <a href="if_your_application_for_refugee_status_is_refused.html">International
    Protection Appeals Tribunal</a></li>
  <li>Finally, based on the recommendation of the International Protection
    Office or the International Protection Appeals Tribunal, the <a href="minister_for_justice.html">Minister for Justice and Equality</a>
    will decide whether to give you a refugee declaration; give you a
    subsidiary protection declaration; or refuse your application</li>
</ul><p>You may make an application for international protection at the port of
entry. You may also make your application for international protection at the
International Protection Office. This section outlines the procedure to be
followed in each case.</p>

<p>You can read more in this <a href="http://www.ipo.gov.ie/en/IPO/IPO%20INFORMATION%20NOTE%20JANUARY%202017.pdf/Files/IPO%20INFORMATION%20NOTE%20JANUARY%202017.pdf">information
note on applications for international protection</a> available on <a href="http://www.ipo.gov.ie/en/ipo/pages/home">ipo.gov.ie</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ipo.gov.ie/en/ipo/pages/whatsnew">Transitional
arrangements</a> will apply to certain applications for international
protection that were made before the commencement date of the International
Protection Act 2015, for the completion of processing under the Act.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lf5020">Application procedure</h2>

<p>Whether you are at the port of entry, or are already in the State and
applying at the International Protection Office, you will first be interviewed
by an immigration officer or an international protection officer. This
preliminary interview is to establish whether you wish to make an application
for international protection and if so, to find out the general grounds upon
which the application is based; your identity, nationality and country of
origin; the method of your entry (that is, the mode of transport used and the
route you travelled) into the State; the reason why you are in the State; the
legal basis for your presence in the State; and whether your application is
inadmissible, either because you have been granted international protection in
another EU state or because a non-EU state is your first country of asylum.</p>

<p>You will be asked to complete an application form for international
protection.</p>

<p>If you have applied for international protection, your accompanying minor
children will be included in your application and all decisions taken in
relation to your international protection application will apply to them.</p>

<p>When your application is received you will be given a written statement
informing you of the procedures for examining your application; your right to
seek <a href="../services_for_asylum_seekers_in_ireland/legal_aid_for_asylum_seekers_in_ireland.html">legal
assistance</a> and your right to an interpreter. You will also be informed of
your <a href="rights_and_obligations_of_asylum_seekers_in_ireland.html">obligations
as an applicant for international protection</a>.</p>

<p>As part of the process, you and your dependent minors will be required to
have your photographs taken. You will also be required to have your
fingerprints taken. Fingerprints of your dependent minors may also be taken.
Your fingerprints may be disclosed in confidence to the relevant Irish
authorities and to asylum authorities of other countries, which may have
responsibility for considering your application under the <a href="dublin_convention.html">Dublin III Regulation</a> (an electronic
system – <a href="eurodac_system.html">Eurodac</a> – facilitates
transfer of fingerprint information between Dublin III Regulation
countries).</p>

<p>If you refuse to allow your fingerprints to be taken, you will be deemed not
to have made reasonable effort to establish your true identity and to have
failed in your duty to co-operate in the investigation of your application.
This may affect the credibility of your application and lead to your
application being withdrawn in which case the Minister for Justice shall refuse
to give you a declaration. You should also note that, under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/section/20/enacted/en/html#sec20">section
20 (1)</a> of the International Protection Act 2015, where an immigration
officer or a member of the Garda Síochána, with reasonable cause, suspects
that an applicant has not made reasonable effort to establish their identity,
they may detain the person concerned.</p>

<p>You will be given permission to remain in the State while your application
is being examined and you will be issued with a temporary residence certificate
setting out your personal details and containing your photograph. The temporary
residence certificate is an immigration registration certificate, and you will
have to produce it if you are asked to do so at any time by an immigration
officer or a member of the Garda Síochána.</p>

<p>When you have received your temporary residence certificate you will be
referred to the Reception and Integration Agency, which will arrange for you to
be taken to a reception centre in the Dublin area. You will remain there for a
short period while your needs are assessed. You will then be relocated to
accommodation, which may be outside Dublin, and where you will be expected to
stay while your application for international protection is being processed.
</p>

<h3>Unaccompanied children</h3>

<p>A child under the age of 18 arriving at the frontiers of the State (port of
entry) or at the International Protection Office and who is not in the custody
of an adult, will be referred to the <a href="../../../birth_family_relationships/family_support_agency.html">Child
and Family Agency (Tusla)</a>. The Agency may then decide that an application
for international protection should be made on behalf of the minor. Specific
arrangements will be made by the Child and Family Agency in conjunction with
the International Protection Office for the processing of such an application.
The Child and Family Agency is responsible for the general care and well being
of the minor and will provide assistance to that minor.</p>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l98e28">Prioritisation of applications</h2>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/section/73/enacted/en/index.html">Section
73</a> of the International Protection Act 2015, the Minister for Justice and
Equality may decide that certain classes of applications are to be dealt with
as a priority. A decision of this nature may have regard to the following:</p>
<ul><li>Whether the applicant possesses identity documents, and, if not, whether
    they have provided a reasonable explanation for the absence of such
    documents</li>
  <li>Whether the applicant has provided a reasonable explanation to
    substantiate their claim that the State is the first safe country in which
    they have arrived since departing from their country of origin</li>
  <li>Whether the applicant has provided a full and true explanation of how
    they travelled to and arrived in the State</li>
  <li>Where the application was made other than at the frontier of the State,
    whether the applicant has provided a reasonable explanation to show why
    they did not make an application for international protection immediately
    on arriving at the frontier of the State</li>
  <li>Where the applicant has forged, destroyed or disposed of any identity or
    other documents relevant to their application, whether they have a
    reasonable explanation for so doing</li>
  <li>Whether the applicant has adduced manifestly false evidence in support of
    their application, or has otherwise made false representations, either
    orally or in writing</li>
  <li><p>Whether the applicant has cooperated with the application process, as
    required under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/section/27/enacted/en/html#sec27">section
    27(1)</a> of the Act</p>
  </li>
  <li>Whether the applicant is a person in respect of whom the Child and Family
    Agency (Tusla) is providing care and protection</li>
  <li>Whether the applicant has, without reasonable cause, failed to comply
    with the requirements under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/section/16/enacted/en/html#sec16">section
    16 (3)</a> of the Act not to leave the State; to inform the Minister of
    their address or change of address; and, if required, to report at
    specified intervals to an immigration officer or to a specified Garda
    station and to reside or remain at the accommodation centre allocated to

<p>On 27 February 2017, the International Protection Office published <a href="http://www.ipo.gov.ie/en/IPO/Prioritisation_of_International_Protection_Applications_IPO_UNHCR_Notice_2017.pdf/Files/Prioritisation_of_International_Protection_Applications_IPO_UNHCR_Notice_2017.pdf">details
of how certain classes of application are to be prioritised (pdf)</a>. Most
applications will be scheduled for interview in the main processing stream on
the basis of “oldest cases first”. However, certain cases will be
prioritised in a separate processing stream, based on the following
criteria:</p>
<ul><li>Whether the applicant is an unaccompanied minor in the care of the Child
    and Family Agency (Tusla)</li>
  <li>Whether the applicant applied as an unaccompanied minor, but has now aged
    out</li>
  <li>Whether the applicant is over 70 years of age and is not part of a family
    group</li>
  <li>Whether the applicant has notified the IPO since 31 December 2016 that a
    medico-legal report, indicating likely well-foundedness, has been
  submitted</li>
  <li>Whether the application is likely to be well-founded due to the country
    of origin or habitual residence of the applicant</li>
  <li>Whether the applicant has notified the IPO since 31 December 2016 that
    evidence has been submitted, certified by a medical consultant, of an
    ongoing severe/life-threatening medical condition</li>
</ul><p>There is detailed information in the IPO’s document on <a href="http://www.ipo.gov.ie/en/IPO/Prioritisation_of_International_Protection_Applications_IPO_UNHCR_Notice_2017.pdf/Files/Prioritisation_of_International_Protection_Applications_IPO_UNHCR_Notice_2017.pdf">prioritisation

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Eurodac system enables the comparison of fingerprints of asylum
applicants and illegal immigrants. The members states of the system are the 28
EU members, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.</p>

<p>The objective of Eurodac in the asylum process is to facilitate the
application of the Dublin III Regulation. This Regulation provides a mechanism
for determining which country is responsible for examining applications for
international protection lodged in one of the member states.</p>

<p>In view of the difficulties anticipated in identifying foreign nationals who
had already lodged an international protection application in another member
state, ministers responsible for immigration agreed in 1991 to establish a
system for the comparison of the fingerprints of international protection
applicants.</p>

<p>The Eurodac system enables member states to identify asylum seekers and
persons who have crossed an external frontier of the European Union in an
irregular manner. By comparing fingerprints using Eurodac, member states can
determine whether an asylum seeker or a foreign national found illegally
present within a member state has previously claimed international protection
in another member state.</p>

<p>(Note: the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/enacted/en/html">International
Protection Act 2015</a> introduces new terminology but, for clarity, we will
continue to use the terms “asylum” and “asylum seeker” as well.)</p>

<p>Eurodac consists of a Central Unit within the <a href="../../../government_in_ireland/european_government/eu_institutions/european_commission.html">EU
Commission</a>, which is equipped with a central database for comparing the
fingerprints of asylum applicants and a system for electronic data transmission
between member states and the database.</p>

<p>In addition to fingerprints, data sent by member states include the member
state of origin (the state sending the data), the place and date of the
international protection application (if applicable), the person’s gender and
a reference number. Data is collected for anyone over 14 years of age and is
encoded directly into the database, either by the Central Unit or by the member
state of origin.</p>

<p>In the case of asylum seekers, data is kept for 10 years unless the
individual obtains the citizenship of one of the member states, when their
particulars are immediately erased. Data relating to foreign nationals
apprehended when attempting to cross an external border irregularly is kept for
2 years from the date on which the fingerprints were taken. Data is immediately
erased before the end of 2 years if the foreign national either:</p>
<ul><li>Receives a residence permit or</li>
  <li>Has left the territory of the member states</li>
</ul><p>In the case of foreign nationals found illegally present within a member
state, Eurodac makes it possible to check their fingerprints against those in
the central database to determine whether the individual had previously lodged
an international protection application in another member state. After the
fingerprints have been transmitted for comparison purposes, they are not stored
by Eurodac.</p>

<p>As regards the protection of personal data, the member state of origin must
ensure that all operations are performed lawfully, such as the taking of
fingerprints, as well as all operations involving the use, transmission,
conservation or erasure of the data.</p>

<h3>Application of Eurodac in Ireland</h3>

<p>As part of the process of making an application for international
protection, you and your dependent minors will be required to have your
photograph taken. You will also be required to have your fingerprints taken.
Fingerprints of your dependent minors may also be taken. Your fingerprints may
be disclosed in confidence to the relevant Irish authorities and to
international protection authorities of other countries, which may have
responsibility for considering your application under the Dublin III
Regulation.</p>

<p>If you refuse to allow your fingerprints to be taken, you will be deemed not
to have made reasonable effort to establish your true identity and to have
failed in your duty to co-operate in the investigation of your application.
This may affect the credibility of your application and lead to your
application being withdrawn, in which case the Minister for Justice and
Equality shall refuse to give you a declaration. You should also note that, in
accordance with section 20 of the International Protection Act 2015, where an
immigration officer or a member of An Garda Síochána, with reasonable cause,
suspects that an applicant has not made reasonable effort to establish their
identity, they may detain the person concerned.</p>

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/enacted/en/html">International
Protection Act 2015</a>, several types of negative outcome may apply, depending
on the nature of your case. </p>

<p>If your application is withdrawn or is deemed to be withdrawn, the Minister
for Justice and Equality will be notified of this. The Minister will then
refuse to give you a refugee or subsidiary protection declaration. When an
application is deemed to be withdrawn, there is no appeal. Read more in our
document on <a href="withdrawing_from_the_asylum_process_in_ireland.html">withdrawing from
the international protection process</a>.</p>

<p>Where an international protection officer makes a recommendation to the
Minister that, under the <a href="dublin_convention.html">Dublin III
Regulation</a>, your application for international protection is inadmissible,
you may appeal to the International Protection Appeals Tribunal against this
recommendation within 10 working days from the date of the notification.</p>

<p>Where an international protection officer makes a recommendation either:</p>
<ul><li>That you should be given a subsidiary protection declaration, but not a
    refugee declaration or</li>
  <li><p>That you should be given neither a refugee nor a subsidiary protection
    declaration,</p>
  </li>
</ul><p>the Minister will notify you and your solicitor (if known) of the
recommendation. You will also be furnished with the reasons for the
recommendation and a copy of the international protection officer’s
report.</p>

<p>You may appeal to the International Protection Appeals Tribunal against the
recommendation within 15 working days from the date of sending the
notification. You are entitled to request an oral hearing for this appeal –
see ‘Appeal with an oral hearing’ below. The Tribunal may also decide to
hold an oral hearing when it believes it is in the interests of justice to do
so.</p>

<p>Where the international protection officer’s report includes among its
findings any one of the following additional findings under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/section/39/enacted/en/html#sec39">section
39 (4)</a> of the Act, the appeal timeline is shorter – see ‘Accelerated
appeal procedures’ below. </p>

<p><strong>Section 39 (4) findings:</strong></p>
<ul><li>That the only issues raised by the applicant had no relevance or minimal
    relevance to their eligibility for international protection</li>
  <li>That the applicant has made inconsistent, contradictory, improbable or
    insufficient representations which make their claim to be eligible for
    international protection clearly unconvincing</li>
  <li><p>That the applicant, without reasonable cause, failed to make an
    application as soon as reasonably practicable, having had opportunity to do
    so</p>
  </li>
  <li>That the applicant’s country of origin is a safe country of origin</li>
  <li>That the applicant is not in need of international protection as they
    could safely return to some part of their country of origin (<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/section/32/enacted/en/html#sec32">section
    32</a> of the Act)</li>
</ul><h3>Accelerated appeal procedures</h3>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/section/43/enacted/en/html#sec43">section
43</a> of the Act, if the report includes any of the above Section 39 (4)
findings, your appeal against the negative recommendation should be made within
10 working days instead of 15 working days. Also, the appeal will be decided
without an oral hearing unless the Tribunal believes it is in the interests of
justice to hold one.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Transitional arrangements </h3>

<p><a href="http://www.ipo.gov.ie/en/ipo/pages/whatsnew">Transitional
arrangements</a> apply to applications for refugee status which were on appeal
to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) but had not been decided on before the
commencement of the International Protection Act 2015</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="la8b89">If you decide to appeal</h2>

<p>If you decide to appeal, the following procedure should be followed:</p>
<ul><li>The appeal must be made in writing on an official Notice of Appeal form,
    which will be included with the notification from the Minister. The Notice
    of Appeal form must be completed and submitted to the International
    Protection Appeals Tribunal – see ‘Where to apply’ below – within
    the specified time limits. </li>
  <li>If you wish to obtain legal advice and you have not done so previously,
    you should do so immediately on receipt of your letter of refusal. You may
    contact the Refugee Legal Service or you may engage private legal
    representation in relation to your appeal. However, the International
    Protection Appeals Tribunal will not refund any legal costs incurred in
    engaging private legal representation. If you wish to engage a solicitor,
    you should do so before completing the Notice of Appeal, because
    consideration of your appeal will be based on this Notice.</li>
  <li>All documents sent to you by the Minister will also be sent to your
    solicitor, if known. </li>
  <li>You must submit all supporting evidence and documentation with the Notice
    of Appeal, because these are the documents on which the appeal will be
    considered. </li>
  <li>You must also set out clearly the grounds of appeal.</li>
  <li>It is your responsibility to prove that your appeal was lodged within the
    permitted time limit. If posted, the Notice of Appeal must be sent by
    registered post and you must keep the certificate of registration you
    receive at the Post Office when you post the letter. If you wish to deliver
    the Notice by hand, you should hand it to a member of staff at the office
    of the International Protection Appeals Tribunal. You will be given a dated
    receipt and you should keep this receipt carefully.</li>
  <li>If you lodge your appeal after the time limit has expired, you must
    request an extension and explain why you could not make an appeal earlier.
  </li>
  <li>You must also inform the Tribunal of any change of address to the address
    provided in your Notice of Appeal. </li>
</ul></div>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l6e092">Consideration of appeals</h2>

<h3>Appeal without an oral hearing </h3>

<p>The International Protection Appeals Tribunal will consider your appeal
without an oral hearing (on the papers only) based on:</p>
<ul><li>Notice of Appeal submitted by you or your solicitor </li>
  <li>Documents and reports furnished by the Minister </li>
  <li>Any observations by the Minister or the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
    (UNHCR).</li>
  <li>Such other matters as the Tribunal considers relevant to the appeal </li>
</ul><h3>Appeal with an oral hearing </h3>
<ul><li>If you request an oral hearing the Tribunal will send a notification to
    you at least 20 working days before the date of the hearing to attend the
    hearing unless you and the Tribunal have agreed to a shorter period. </li>
  <li>Your oral hearing will be conducted by a member of the Tribunal.</li>
  <li>The hearing must be attended by you and your solicitor (if any) and any
    witnesses directed to attend by the Tribunal. The international protection
    officer will also attend. The UNHCR may attend as an observer.</li>
  <li>Where you are entitled to an oral hearing, you must indicate this on your
    Notice of Appeal form. You may also request in your Notice of Appeal that a
    witness or witnesses attend to give evidence in support of your appeal. The
    notification of the date of your oral hearing will indicate whether your
    request for the attendance of a witness has been granted. </li>
  <li>In some cases, other observers may attend oral hearings at the discretion
    of the Tribunal. </li>
  <li>If you need an interpreter at your appeal hearing, you will be provided
    with one. In your Notice of Appeal, you should specify the precise language
    or dialect for which you require interpretation. The sole function of the
    interpreter is to interpret the questions and your responses accurately and
    literally.</li>
  <li>The oral hearing will be conducted as informally as is practicable and in
    such a manner as to ensure that the proceedings are fair and transparent.
    The Tribunal may hear 2 or more hearings together where it appears cases
    have a common matter, relates to members of the same family or it is
    otherwise reasonable to hear cases together.</li>
  <li>In general, you must have all your documents lodged with the Tribunal at
    least 10 working days prior to your oral hearing. However, the Tribunal may
    accept later lodgment of additional documents in certain circumstances, as
    specified in the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/si/116/made/en/pdf">International
    Protection Act 2015 (Procedures and Periods for Appeals) Regulations 2017
    (pdf)</a>. </li>
  <li>You may withdraw a request for an oral hearing by giving written notice
    to the Tribunal not later than 3 working days before the hearing. The
    written notice must set out the reason for the withdrawal. </li>
</ul><h3>Failure to attend an oral hearing </h3>

<p>Where you fail, without reasonable cause, to attend an oral hearing, then
unless you furnish to the Tribunal, not later than 3 working days from the date
fixed for the oral hearing, an explanation for not attending which the Tribunal
considers reasonable in the circumstances, your appeal shall be deemed to be
withdrawn. You and your solicitor (if known) will be notified of the
withdrawal. The Minister for Justice and Equality will also be notified of the
withdrawal. Read more in our document <a href="withdrawing_from_the_asylum_process_in_ireland.html">Withdrawing from
the international protection process</a>. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l342a4">If you do not appeal</h2>

<p>If the International Protection Office has recommended that you be given a
subsidiary protection declaration and you do not appeal to the International
Protection Appeals Tribunal within the time allowed, the recommendation will
stand and the Minister will give you a subsidiary protection declaration. </p>

<p>If the recommendation of the International Protection Office is that you
should not be given either a refugee declaration or a subsidiary protection
declaration, the Minister will then consider whether you should be given
permission to remain in the State, even if you do not appeal. When deciding
this, under section 49 of the Act, the Minister must have regard to your family
and personal circumstances including your connection with the State (if any),
humanitarian considerations and considerations of national security and public
order.</p>

<p>If you are not given permission to remain as a result, the Minister will
refuse to give you a declaration and may make arrangements for your removal
from the State. You can read more in our document about <a href="minister_for_justice.html">decisions on international protection made
by the Minister for Justice and Equality.</a> </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="lc8724">Outcome of your appeal</h2>

<p>You and your solicitor (if known) will be notified in writing of the
decision of the International Protection Appeals Tribunal. A copy of the
decision will be forwarded to the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>

<p>If the decision of the Tribunal allows your appeal, the Minister will give
you a refugee or a subsidiary protection declaration, subject to considerations
of national security or public order. </p>

<p><strong>Review:</strong> If the decision of the Tribunal does not allow your
appeal, you may submit to the Minister information about change of
circumstances or other information that would have been relevant when
permission to remain in the State was being considered. Based on this
information, the Minister will review the previous decision to refuse you
permission to remain. </p>

<h3>Subsequent application</h3>

<p>If you have received a decision on your application for international
protection but you wish to apply again, you may be able to make a
<em>subsequent application</em>. You must first apply for the Minister’s
consent to the making of a subsequent application under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/section/22/enacted/en/html#sec22">section
22</a> of the Act.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You must satisfy the following condition:</p>
<ul><li>New elements or findings have emerged since your previous application,
    which make it significantly more likely that you will qualify for
    international protection, and you were incapable of presenting those
    elements or findings for the purposes of your previous application, or</li>
</ul><p></p>

<p>If the Minister consents to the making of a subsequent application, you
should make the application within 10 working days.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If the Minister does not consent to the making of a subsequent application,
you can appeal this refusal within 10 working days from the date of the
notification. The decision in this appeal will be made without an oral
hearing.</p>

<p></p>

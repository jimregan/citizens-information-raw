<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>A number of different types of a negative recommendation may apply depending
on the nature of your case. </p>

<p>Where the Refugee Applications Commissioner makes a recommendation that you
should not be declared a refugee because your application was withdrawn or
where your application is deemed to be withdrawn, the Minister for Justice and
Equality will be advised of this recommendation and you will be notified of
this by registered post. There is no appeal against any such recommendation.</p>

<p>Where the Refugee Applications Commissioner makes a recommendation that you
should not be declared a refugee, the normal position is that you may appeal to
the Refugee Appeals Tribunal against the recommendation within 15 working days
from the sending of the notice. The notice will be sent to you by registered
post, and to your solicitor (if known). You will also be furnished with the
reasons for the recommendation including the material which was relied upon in
coming to a recommendation. You are entitled to request an oral hearing for
this appeal. If you appeal but do not request an oral hearing, your appeal will
be dealt with by the Tribunal without an oral hearing.</p>

<p>Where the Refugee Applications Commissioner's negative recommendation
includes among its findings any one of the additional findings (called "Section
13(6) findings") listed below, you may appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal
against the recommendation within 10 working days from the sending of the
notice. The notice will be sent to you by registered post and to your solicitor
(if known). You will also be furnished with the reasons for the recommendation
including the material which was relied upon in coming to a recommendation. Any
such appeal will be dealt with by the Tribunal without an oral hearing.</p>

<p>Section 13(6) findings:</p>
<ul><li>That the applicant showed either no basis or a minimal basis for the
    contention that he or she is a refugee </li>
  <li>That the applicant made statements or provided information in support of
    the application of such a false, contradictory, misleading or incomplete
    nature as to lead to the conclusion that his or her application is
    manifestly unfounded </li>
  <li>That the applicant, without reasonable care, failed to make an
    application as soon as reasonably practicable after arrival in the State
  </li>
  <li>That the applicant had lodged a prior application for asylum in another
    state party to the Geneva Convention (whether or not that application had
    been determined, granted or rejected); or </li>
  <li>That the applicant is a national of, or has a right of residence in, a
    safe country of origin for the time being so designated by the Minister for
    Justice by order under section 12(4) of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended.
  </li>
</ul><p>The Minister for Justice has the power to direct certain categories of
applications to be dealt with in accordance with procedures set out in section
13(8) of the Refugee Act. If the Minister for Justice issues such a direction
and your application is to be dealt with in this way, you will be notified in
writing in advance by the Commissioner, as will your solicitor (if known). </p>

<p>Under the procedures set out at section 13(8), should a negative
recommendation be made by the Commissioner and should any one of the additional
findings listed in section 13(6) of the Act apply, you will have four working
days to appeal from the sending of the notice. The notice will be sent to your
solicitor (if known). You will be furnished with the reasons for the
recommendation, including the material which was relied upon in coming to a
recommendation. Any such appeal will be dealt with by the Tribunal without an
oral hearing. </p>

<h3>If you decide to appeal</h3>

<p>If you decide to appeal, the following procedure should be followed:</p>
<ul><li>The appeal must be made in writing on an official Notice of Appeal form,
    which will be included with the notification from the Refugee Applications
    Commissioner. The Notice of Appeal form must be completed and submitted to
    the Refugee Appeals Tribunal 6-7 Hanover Street, Dublin 2, within the
    specified time limits set out in paragraphs ii, iii and iv above. The
    Notice of Appeal must be completed in full including grounds of appeal by
    either you or your solicitor. </li>
  <li>It is your responsibility to prove that your appeal was lodged within the
    permitted time limit. If posted, the Notice of Appeal must be sent by
    registered post and you must keep the certificate of registration you
    receive at the Post Office when you post the letter. If you wish to deliver
    the Notice by hand, you should hand it to a member of staff at the office
    of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. You will be given a dated receipt and you
    should keep this receipt carefully. If you send the Notice by fax you must
    keep the successful transmission report. </li>
  <li>If you wish to obtain legal advice and you have not done so previously,
    you should do so immediately on receipt of your letter of refusal. In this
    regard, you may contact the Refugee Legal Service. You also have the option
    to engage private legal representation in relation to your appeal. However,
    the Refugee Appeals Tribunal will not refund any legal costs incurred in
    engaging private legal representation. If you wish to engage a solicitor,
    you should do so before completing the Notice of Appeal, because
    consideration of your appeal will be based on this Notice. </li>
  <li>You should give all documents sent to you by the Refugee Applications
    Commissioner to your solicitor. </li>
  <li>You must submit all supporting evidence and documentation with the Notice
    of Appeal, because these are the documents on which the appeal will be
    considered. </li>
  <li>You must also set out clearly the grounds of appeal. </li>
  <li>You must also inform the Tribunal of any change of address to the address
    provided in your Notice of Appeal. </li>
</ul><h3>Consideration of an appeal by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal without an oral
hearing arising from paragraphs ii, iii, and iv above</h3>

<p>The Refugee Appeals Tribunal will consider your appeal without an oral
hearing (on the papers only) in accordance with ii, iii, or iv above based
on:</p>
<ul><li>"Notice of Appeal" submitted by you or your solicitor, </li>
  <li>documents and reports furnished by the Refugee Applications Commissioner,
  </li>
  <li>any further supporting documents submitted by you and/or your solicitor,
  </li>
  <li>Notice of enquiries made or observations furnished by the Refugee
    Applications Commissioner under sections 16(6) and (7) of the Refugee Act
    1996, as amended, if any, or any observations by the High Commissioner for
    Refugees. </li>
</ul><h3>Consideration of an appeal by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal with an oral
hearing</h3>
<ul><li>If you request an oral hearing the Refugee Appeals Tribunal will send a
    notification to you at least seven working days before the date of the
    hearing to attend the hearing. </li>
  <li>Your oral hearing will be conducted by a Member of the Refugee Appeals
    Tribunal. </li>
  <li>The hearing must be attended by you and your solicitor (if any) and any
    witnesses directed to attend by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. The Refugee
    Applications Commissioner or an authorised officer of the Commissioner will
    also attend. The UNHCR may attend as an observer. </li>
  <li>Where you are entitled to an oral hearing, you must indicate this on your
    Notice of Appeal form. You may also request in your Notice of Appeal that a
    witness or witnesses attend to give evidence in support of your appeal. The
    notification of the date of your oral hearing will indicate whether your
    request for the attendance of a witness has been granted. </li>
  <li>In some cases, other observers may attend oral hearings at the discretion
    of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. </li>
  <li>If you require an interpreter at your appeal hearing, every reasonable
    effort will be made to provide one. In your Notice of Appeal, you should
    specify the precise language or dialect for which you require
    interpretation. The sole function of the interpreter is to interpret the
    questions and your responses accurately and literally. </li>
  <li>The oral hearing will be conducted as informally as is practicable and in
    such a manner as to ensure that the proceedings are fair and transparent.
  </li>
  <li>You may withdraw a request for an oral hearing by giving written notice
    to the Tribunal not later than three working days before the hearing. The
    written notice must set out the reason for the withdrawal. </li>
</ul><h3>Failure to attend an oral hearing</h3>

<p>Where you fail, without reasonable cause, to attend an oral hearing, then
unless you furnish to the Tribunal, not later than three working days from the
date fixed for the oral hearing, an explanation for not attending which the
Tribunal considers reasonable in the circumstances, your appeal shall be deemed
to be withdrawn. You and your solicitor (if known) will be notified of the
withdrawal. The Minister for Justice and the Commissioner will also be notified
of the withdrawal and the Minister shall refuse to give you a declaration as a
refugee and will notify you that arrangements will be made for your removal
from the State.</p>

<p>The failure of a witness to attend will not necessarily prevent the hearing
to take place.</p>

<h3>If you do not appeal</h3>

<p>If you do not appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal within the time allowed
from the sending of the notification, the Refugee Applications Commissioner
will recommend to the Minister for Justice that you should not be given a
declaration as a refugee. The Minister may refuse to give you a declaration and
may make arrangements for your removal from the State.</p>

<h3>Outcome of your appeal</h3>

<p>You and your solicitor (if known) will be notified in writing of the
decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. A copy of the decision will be
forwarded to the Minister for Justice who, in the case of a negative
recommendation, may refuse to give you a declaration as a refugee and make
arrangements for your removal from the State. If the decision of the Refugee
Appeals Tribunal is positive, you will receive a declaration as a refugee by
the Minister subject to considerations of national security or public order.</p>

<h3>Options available to you</h3>

<p>Where the Minister proposes to make a deportation order requiring you to
leave the State, you will be given four options. These options are: </p>
<ul><li>To make representations to the Minister within 15 working days setting
    out why you should be allowed to remain in the State </li>
  <li>To leave the State before the Minister decides the matter and inform the
    Minister in writing of the arrangements you have made for this purpose </li>
  <li>To consent to the making of the deportation order within 15 working days.
  </li>

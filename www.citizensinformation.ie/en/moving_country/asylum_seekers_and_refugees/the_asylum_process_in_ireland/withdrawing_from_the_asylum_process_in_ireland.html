<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/enacted/en/html">International
Protection Act 2015</a> provides for the withdrawal of applications for
international protection (refugee status and subsidiary protection). You may
withdraw your application at the first stage or at the appeal stage. In certain
circumstances your application may be deemed to be withdrawn – see below.</p>

<h3>Withdrawal at first stage</h3>

<p>If your <a href="applying_for_refugee_status_in_ireland.html">application
for international protection</a> is still under consideration by the
International Protection Office, you may withdraw your application by notifying
the Minister for Justice and Equality in writing. When the Minister is notified
of your withdrawal, they will refuse to give you either a declaration of
refugee status or a declaration of subsidiary protection. If you have a
solicitor, they will be notified. The Minister may arrange for your removal
from the State unless you have been granted permission to remain in the State.
</p>

<h3>Withdrawal at appeal stage</h3>

<p>If you wish to withdraw at the <a href="if_your_application_for_refugee_status_is_refused.html">appeal
stage</a>, you should send your notice of withdrawal to the International
Protection Appeals Tribunal. If your appeal is withdrawn or deemed to be
withdrawn, the Minister for Justice and Equality will refuse to give you a
refugee or subsidiary protection declaration. The Minister may then arrange for
your removal from the State unless you have been granted permission to remain
in the State or you have agreed to return voluntarily to your country of
origin.</p>

<h3>Applications deemed to be withdrawn</h3>

<p>There are a number of circumstances in which failure on your part to comply
with your statutory obligations may result in your application for
international protection (or your appeal against refusal) being deemed
withdrawn. In which case, the Minister shall refuse to give you a refugee
status or subsidiary protection declaration. These are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Failure to inform the Minister for Justice and Equality of your address
    or change of address</li>
  <li>Failure to report when required to do so</li>
  <li>Failure to reside or remain at a particular district of place in the
    State when required to do so</li>
  <li>Leaving or attempting to leave the State without the consent of the
    Minister for Justice and Equality</li>
  <li>Failure to co-operate with the International Protection Office or to
    furnish information relevant to your application</li>
  <li>Failure to attend for interview with the International Protection
  Office</li>
  <li>Failure to co-operate with the International Protection Appeals Tribunal
    or to furnish information relevant to your appeal</li>
  <li>Failure to attend for an oral hearing with the Tribunal, without
    reasonable cause</li>
</ul><p></p>

<p>Where an application is withdrawn or is deemed withdrawn, there is no
appeal.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Subsequent application</h3>

<p>If your application for international protection has been withdrawn or is
deemed withdrawn, but you wish to apply again, you may be able to make a
<em>subsequent application</em>. You must first apply for the Minister’s
consent to the making of a subsequent application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You must satisfy the following condition:</p>
<ul><li>Your previous application was withdrawn or deemed withdrawn through no
    fault of your own, and therefore you were incapable of pursuing your
    previous application.</li>
</ul><p></p>

<p></p>

<p>If the Minister consents to the making of a subsequent application, you
should make the application within 10 working days.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If the Minister does not consent to the making of a subsequent application,
you can appeal this refusal within 10 working days from the date of the
notification. The decision in this appeal will be made without an oral
hearing.</p>

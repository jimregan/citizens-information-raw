<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l6ead1">If you are refused a declaration</h2>

<p>If the International Protection Office or the International Protection
Appeals Tribunal recommends to the Minister for Justice and Equality that you
should be refused a refugee or subsidiary protection declaration, the Minister
may refuse to give you a refugee or subsidiary protection declaration. You will
be sent a notice in writing stating that your application for a refugee or
subsidiary protection declaration has been refused. </p>

<h3>Voluntary return </h3>

<p>If your application for a refugee or subsidiary protection declaration has
been refused, the Minister may inform you in writing that you may withdraw your
application and return voluntarily to your country of origin. If you confirm to
the Minister that you will comply with this, the Minister will not make a
deportation order requiring you to leave the State. </p>

<h3>Permission to remain </h3>

<p>If the International Protection Office has made a recommendation that you
should be refused a refugee or subsidiary protection declaration, and this
recommendation has not been overturned by the International Protection Appeals
Tribunal, the Minister may consider whether you should be given permission to
remain in the State. When deciding this, under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/section/49/enacted/en/html#sec49">section
49</a> of the Act, the Minister must have regard to your family and personal
circumstances including your connection with the State (if any), humanitarian
considerations and considerations of national security and public order. </p>

<p>If the Minister for Justice and Equality has refused to give you a refugee
or subsidiary protection declaration or permission to remain, the Minister may
make a deportation order against you in accordance with the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1999/en/act/pub/0022/index.html">Immigration
Act 1999</a>, as amended. The notice of the deportation order may require you

member of the Garda Síochána or immigration officer at a date, time and place

    requirement </li>
  <li>Intends to leave the State and enter another state illegally </li>

vehicle or train that is due to leave the State. Under section 78 of the
International Protection Act 2015, for the purposes of arresting that person,
the officer may enter (using reasonable force if necessary) and search any
premises where the person is or where the officer suspects the person is. If it
is a dwelling, the officer will not enter without consent unless the person is
ordinarily resident there or the officer has reasonable grounds for believing

renewal of leave to remain in the State and/or family reunification shall not
apply to a person who has been given a refugee declaration or a subsidiary
protection declaration. </p>

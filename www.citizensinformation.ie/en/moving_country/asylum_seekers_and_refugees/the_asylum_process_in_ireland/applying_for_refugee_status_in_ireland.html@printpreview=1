<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0017/index.html">Refugee
Act 1996</a>, as amended by <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1999/en/act/pub/0022/sec0011.html#sec11">Section
11(1) of the Immigration Act 1999</a>, and by <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0029/sec0009.html#sec9">Section

7 of the Immigration Act 2003,</a> your application for a declaration as a
refugee will be dealt with:</p>
<ul><li>At first instance by the <a shape="rect" href="how_refugee_applications_commissioner_deals_with_applications.html">Refugee
    Applications Commissioner</a> who will make a recommendation in relation to
    your case. </li>
  <li>If the recommendation is negative and you are entitled to appeal, any
    such appeal will be dealt with by the <a shape="rect" href="if_your_application_for_refugee_status_is_refused.html">Refugee
    Appeals Tribunal</a>, </li>
  <li>Finally, based on the recommendation of the Refugee Applications
    Commissioner or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, a decision will be taken by
    the <a shape="rect" href="minister_for_justice.html">Minister for Justice
    and Equality</a>. </li>
</ul><p>You may make an application for a declaration as a refugee at the port of
entry. At the port of entry, you will undergo certain formalities including an
initial interview but you will always be required to subsequently attend at the
Office at the Refugee Applications Commissioner. You may also make your
application for a declaration as a refugee at the Office of the Refugee
Applications Commissioner. This section outlines the procedure to be followed
in each case.</p>

<p><strong>Subsidiary protection:</strong> Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/si/137/made/en/print">European
Union (Subsidiary Protection) (Amendment) Regulations 2015</a>, if you are
applying for refugee status, you may also make an application for <a href="http://www.orac.ie/website/orac/oracwebsite.nsf/page/AJNR-9DVGAX1211128-en/%24File/ORAC%20SP%20INFORMATION%20NOTE%2027.11.13.pdf">subsidiary
protection (pdf)</a> to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. If
you already have an application for refugee status pending, you can now apply
for subsidiary protection as well.</p>

<h3>Changes to immigration law</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/enacted/en/html">International
Protection Act 2015</a> will provide for:</p>
<ul><li>A single application procedure for protection which will incorporate
    applications for refugee status, subsidiary protection and leave to
  remain</li>
  <li>Processing of protection applications to be transferred from the Office
    of the Refugee Applications Commissioner to the Department of Justice and
    Equality</li>
  <li>Establishment of an independent International Protection Appeals
  Tribunal</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Applying at the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner/port of
entry</h3>

<p>If you indicate that you wish to apply for asylum, you will be asked to
complete an application form for a declaration as a refugee. </p>

<p>If you wish to make a separate application on behalf of your minor children
(or dependent(s)), a separate application form for a declaration must be
completed for each minor child (or dependent). If not, your accompanying minor
children (or dependent(s)) will be included in your decision and all decisions
taken in relation to your asylum application will apply to them. </p>

<p>Your application must be accompanied by any original travel documents
(passports, laissez-passer) in your possession and, if appropriate, those of
your children under 18 years. Unless you have a reasonable cause for not doing
so, you must also furnish originals of all identity documents, birth and
marriage certificates in your possession relating to you and/or your minor
children (or dependent(s)).</p>

<p>You will be given an initial interview, in accordance with <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0017/sec0008.html#zza17y1996s8">Section
8 of the Refugee Act 1996,</a> as amended, in order to establish whether you
wish to make an application for a declaration, and if so, to find out the
general grounds upon which the application is based; your identity, nationality
and country of origin; the method of your entry (that is, the mode of transport
used and the route you travelled) into the State; the reason why you are in the
State; the legal basis for your presence in the State and any other basic
information that the Refugee Applications Commissioner requires.</p>

<p>At the end of your interview you will be advised of your right to seek <a href="../services_for_asylum_seekers_in_ireland/legal_aid_for_asylum_seekers_in_ireland.html">legal
assistance</a> and to consult with the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)</a>.</p>

<p>If you have applied at the port of entry, you are required to attend the
office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner to complete the initial asylum
process. If you do not do so and do not provide an address to the Commissioner
within 5 working days of making an application, your application will be deemed
to be withdrawn. </p>

<p>As part of the process, you and your dependent minors will be required to
have your photographs taken. You will also be required to have your
fingerprints taken. Fingerprints of your dependent minors may also be taken.
Your fingerprints may be disclosed in confidence to the relevant Irish
authorities and to asylum authorities of other countries, which may have
responsibility for considering your application under the <a shape="rect" href="dublin_convention.html">Dublin III Regulation</a> (an electronic system -
<a shape="rect" href="eurodac_system.html">Eurodac</a> - facilitates transfer
of fingerprint information between Dublin III Regulation countries). </p>

<p>If you refuse to allow your fingerprints to be taken, you will be deemed not
to have made reasonable effort to establish your true identity and to have
failed in your duty to co-operate in the investigation of your application.
This may affect the credibility of your application and lead to your
application being withdrawn in which case the Minister for Justice shall refuse
to give you a declaration. You should also note that in accordance with section
9(8)(c), where an immigration officer or a member of the Garda Síochána, with
reasonable cause, suspects that an applicant has not made reasonable effort to
establish his or her identity, he or she may detain the person concerned.</p>

<p>You will be given a questionnaire, which you must complete and return at a
date and time specified by the Refugee Applications Commissioner. The
information you supply in the questionnaire will be considered in assessing
your application. It is important, therefore, that you answer all questions
fully and truthfully.</p>

<p>If you fail to return your questionnaire by the specified date, you may be
found to have failed in your duty to co-operate in the investigation of your
application and your application may be deemed withdrawn, in which case the
Minister shall refuse to give you a declaration.</p>

<p>Before you leave the Reception Unit at the Office of the Refugee
Applications Commissioner you will be issued with a Temporary Residence
Certificate setting out your personal details and containing your photograph.
The Temporary Residence Certificate is not an identity document.</p>

<p>When you have received your Temporary Residence Certificate you will be
referred to the Reception and Integration Agency counter in the Office of the
Refugee Applications Commissioner, which will arrange for you to be taken to a
reception centre in the Dublin area where you will remain for a short period,
while your needs are assessed. You will then be relocated to accommodation,
which may be outside Dublin, and where you will be expected to stay while your
application for a declaration as a refugee is being processed. </p>

<h3>Unaccompanied minors/separated children</h3>

<p>A child under the age of 18 arriving at the frontiers of the State (port of
entry) or at the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and who is not
in the custody of an adult, will be referred to the <a href="../../../birth_family_relationships/family_support_agency.html">Child
and Family Agency</a>. The Agency may then decide that an application for a
declaration as a refugee should be made on behalf of the minor. Specific
arrangements will be made by the Child and Family Agency in conjunction with
the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner for the processing of such
an application. The Agency is responsible for the general care and well being
of the minor and will provide assistance to that minor.</p>

<h3>Prioritisation of applications</h3>

<p>The Minister for Justice and Equality may give a direction in writing to the
Commissioner, or the Tribunal or to both which requires that certain classes of
applications be dealt with as a priority.</p>

<p>In the event that your application is covered by such a direction, you will
be advised of this.</p>

<p>A Ministerial direction of this nature may be determined by reference to one
or more of the following matters:</p>
<ul><li>The grounds of the applications under section 8 of the Refugee Act 1996,
    as amended; </li>
  <li>The country of origin or habitual residence of applicants; </li>
  <li>Any family relationship between applicants; </li>

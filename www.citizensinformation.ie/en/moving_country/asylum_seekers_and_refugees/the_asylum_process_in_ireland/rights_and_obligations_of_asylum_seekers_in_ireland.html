<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>During the period that your <a href="applying_for_refugee_status_in_ireland.html">application for
international protection</a> is being processed in Ireland, you have certain
rights and obligations under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/enacted/en/html">International
Protection Act 2015</a>. </p>

<h3>Your rights</h3>
<ul><li>Unless your case is to be dealt with in accordance with the <a href="http://www.orac.ie/website/orac/oracwebsite.nsf/page/eudublinIIIregulation-main-en">Dublin
    III Regulation</a>, you will not be removed from the State until you have
    been given the opportunity to present your case fully to the International
    Protection Office.</li>
  <li>Every effort will be made to provide you with an interpreter, where
    necessary and possible.</li>
  <li>You are entitled to consult a solicitor. The <a href="../services_for_asylum_seekers_in_ireland/legal_aid_for_asylum_seekers_in_ireland.html">Refugee
    Legal Service</a> is an independent body that provides legal assistance to
    individuals applying for international protection. An information leaflet
    about the Refugee Legal Service will be given to you when you make your
    initial application.</li>
  <li>You are entitled to consult with the <a href="http://www.unhcr.ie/">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
    (UNHCR)</a> who has an office in Dublin.</li>
  <li>The Reception and Integration Agency will provide you with accommodation
    (on a full board basis) in one of their accommodation centres while your
    application for international protection is being processed. You are
    entitled to <a href="../services_for_asylum_seekers_in_ireland/direct_provision.html">welfare
    support and health care</a> while your application is being processed.</li>
  <li>All details provided in connection with your application will be treated
    in confidence. Information may, however, be disclosed to other bodies that
    may be dealing with you, such as government departments and agencies,
    including the immigration authorities, An Garda Síochána (the Irish
    Police), local authorities and the UNHCR, to enable these organisations
    carry out their functions. These functions include administering the law
    relating to the entry and removal from the State of foreign nationals. Some
    information may also be provided to other countries operating the <a href="dublin_convention.html">Dublin III Regulation</a> for the purpose
    of operating these arrangements.</li>
  <li>You will be notified in writing at the most recent address given by you
    of any appointments you must keep and any recommendations made or decisions
    taken in connection with your application for international protection by
    the International Protection Office, the International Protection Appeals
    Tribunal and the Minister for Justice and Equality (as appropriate).</li>
  <li>You have the right to view and correct any data concerning you which is
    held on the Eurodac system. You will be given the opportunity to do this
    while you are in the International Protection Office or you can write to
    the International Protection Office to rectify any incorrect data – see
    ‘Where to apply’ below.</li>
</ul><h3>Your obligations</h3>
<ul><li>You must comply with the laws of the State.</li>
  <li>You must notify, in writing, the Minister for Justice and Equality of
    your address as soon as possible and any change of address. Failure to do
    so could result in you being found guilty of an offence under the
    International Protection Act 2015. Failure to do so could also result in
    you not receiving important notifications in relation to your application
    and consequently failing to meet time limits for lodging documentation,
    appeals, and so on. You can find out more about offences under the
    International Protection Act 2015 – see 'Further information' below.</li>
  <li>In all correspondence with the International Protection Office or the
    International Protection Appeals Tribunal you should clearly indicate your
    name, address, nationality, and the reference number shown on your
    temporary residence certificate.</li>
  <li>You must not leave or attempt to leave the State without the consent of
    the Minister for Justice and Equality while your application is under
    consideration.</li>
  <li>You are not entitled to seek or enter employment or carry on any
    business, trade or profession.</li>
  <li>You may be required to report at specified intervals to an immigration
    officer or to a specified Garda station.</li>
  <li>You are required to reside or remain at the accommodation centre
    allocated to you by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA).</li>
  <li>You can only move from this accommodation with the permission of the RIA
    and only in circumstances where the RIA is in a position to offer you
    alternative accommodation.</li>
  <li>You must be truthful at all times in the information you provide in
    connection with your application. If you are not, it may lead to a finding
    that your application is manifestly unfounded. In such circumstances, you
    would have a shorter period within which to appeal and any appeal you might
    make would be dealt with without an oral hearing.</li>
  <li>You must co-operate fully with the investigation of your application.
    Failure to do so could affect the credibility of your application or result
    in your application being deemed withdrawn.</li>
  <li>You should make all information relevant to your application available to
    the International Protection Office. If you do not do so and seek to bring
    forward additional information at appeal stage, you will be required to
    explain why this information was not made available to the International
    Protection Office. The International Protection Appeals Tribunal will be
    required to take this into account in assessing the credibility of your
    application</li>
  <li>You must provide the International Protection Office or the International
    Protection Appeals Tribunal (as appropriate), with details of your <a href="../../../justice/courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a> and any
    change of solicitor (name, address, phone number, and so on).</li>
  <li>You or your solicitor must retain all copies of documentation given to
    you by the International Protection Office and the International Protection
    Appeals Tribunal. Only in exceptional circumstances will additional copies
    of the documents be made available.</li>
</ul><h3>Applications which may be deemed to be withdrawn.</h3>

<p>There are a number of circumstances in which failure on your part to comply
with your statutory obligations may result in <a href="withdrawing_from_the_asylum_process_in_ireland.html">your application
for international protection being deemed withdrawn</a>. In this case, the
Minister for Justice shall refuse to give you a declaration.</p>

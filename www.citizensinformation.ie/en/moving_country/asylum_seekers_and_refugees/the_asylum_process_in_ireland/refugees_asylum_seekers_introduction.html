<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The term <em>refugee</em> is commonly used to describe a number of
categories of people. These categories of people may have <span>different legal
statuses</span> and as a result of these different legal statuses, they may
have varying rights and obligations. All of these people are linked to the
international protection process as defined in Irish law and based on
international convention. </p>

<h3>International protection</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/enacted/en/html">International
Protection Act 2015</a>, which came into effect on 31 December 2016, provides
for a <a href="applying_for_refugee_status_in_ireland.html">single
application procedure for international protection</a>. Under Section 2 of the
Act, a person who qualifies for international protection is “a person who is
either—</p>

<p>(a) a refugee and in relation to whom a refugee declaration is in force,
or</p>

<p>(b) a person eligible for subsidiary protection and in relation to whom a
subsidiary protection declaration is in force”</p>

<h3>Irish Refugee Protection Programme</h3>

<p>The Government is introducing the <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR15000463">Irish Refugee Protection
Programme that will provide international protection for up to 4,000
people</a>. A network of emergency and orientation centres will be established
where assessments and decisions on refugee status will be made. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="le48c7">Different categories</h2>

<h3>Asylum seeker</h3>

<p>An asylum seeker is a person who seeks to be recognised as a refugee under
the terms of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees as defined
in Section 2 of the International Protection Act 2015. The Act introduces a new
term “applicant” but, for clarity, we will continue to use the term
“asylum seeker” as well. Under Section 2 of the Act, the legal definition
of a refugee is a person who, "owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted
for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of
a particular social group, is outside his or her country of nationality and is
unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the
protection of that country, or a stateless person, who, being outside of the
country of former habitual residence for the same reasons as mentioned above,
is unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to return to it" </p>

<h3>Convention refugee</h3>

<p>A Convention refugee is a person who fulfills the requirements of the
definition of a refugee under the terms of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49da0e466.html">Geneva Convention</a> relating
to the status of refugees as defined in the International Protection Act 2015
and who is granted refugee status. </p>

<h3>Programme refugee</h3>

<p>A Programme refugee is a person who has been invited to Ireland under a
Government decision in response to a humanitarian request, usually from the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)</a>, either for the purposes of
temporary protection or resettlement.</p>

<h3>Subsidiary protection</h3>

<p>Section 2 of the International Protection Act 2015 defines a person eligible
for subsidiary protection as someone “who does not qualify as a refugee [and]
in respect of whom substantial grounds have been shown for believing that he or
she, if returned to his or her country of origin, would face a real risk of
suffering serious harm and who is unable or, owing to such risk, unwilling to
avail himself or herself of the protection of that country”.</p>

<h3>Permission to remain</h3>

<p>Under section 49 of the International Protection Act 2015, if an applicant
is not given either a refugee declaration or a subsidiary protection
declaration, the Minister for Justice and Equality may consider whether they
should be given permission to remain in the State. When making this decision,
the Minister will have regard to the applicant’s family and personal
circumstances along with other matters, including the applicant’s connection
to the State and humanitarian considerations. </p>

<h2>Information</h2>

<p>If you have arrived in Ireland and you want to apply for international
protection (refugee status or subsidiary protection), you need to know about
the legal process for doing so. You need to know about the <a shape="rect" href="rights_and_obligations_of_asylum_seekers_in_ireland.html">rights and
obligations of asylum seekers</a> and the <a href="refugees_asylum_seekers_introduction.html">different legal statuses of
asylum seekers and refugees</a>. </p>

<p>(Note: the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/enacted/en/html">International
Protection Act 2015</a> introduces new terminology but, for clarity, we will
continue to use the terms “asylum” and “asylum seeker” as well.) </p>

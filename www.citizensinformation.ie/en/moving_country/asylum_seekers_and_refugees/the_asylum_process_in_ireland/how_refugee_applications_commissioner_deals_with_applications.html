<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/enacted/en/html">International
Protection Act 2015</a>, if you have submitted an <a href="applying_for_refugee_status_in_ireland.html">application for
international protection</a> in Ireland to the International Protection Office,
your application will first be assessed to establish the relevant facts and
circumstances. Following the assessment, an international protection officer
will examine your application in order to recommend whether or not you should
be given a refugee declaration or a subsidiary protection declaration. The
international protection officer will then make a recommendation based on the
examination and send it to the Minister for Justice and Equality, who will
notify you about the recommendation.</p>

<p>When your application is being assessed and examined, you have a duty to:</p>
<ul><li>Provide all the information and details relevant to your particular
    circumstances</li>
  <li>Co-operate in the assessment and examination of your application</li>
</ul><p>The International Protection Office has published a detailed <a href="http://www.ipo.gov.ie/en/IPO/InfoBookletNew.pdf/Files/InfoBookletNew.pdf">information
booklet for applicants for international protection (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l2b5e9">Assessment of your application</h2>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/section/28/enacted/en/html#sec28">section
28</a> of the Act, an international protection officer will assess your
statements and all other documents providing information such as your age,
identity, country or countries of previous residence, previous asylum
applications, travel routes and your reasons for applying for international
protection. </p>

<p>When carrying out the assessment, the international protection officer will
take the following into account: </p>
<ul><li>All relevant facts relating to your country of origin </li>
  <li>Relevant statements and documentation presented by you, including
    information as to whether you have been or may be subject to persecution or
    serious harm </li>
  <li>Your position and personal circumstances </li>
  <li>Whether your activities since leaving your country of origin were engaged
    in to create conditions allowing you to apply for international protection
  </li>
  <li>Whether you could obtain the protection of another country where you
    could claim citizenship </li>
  <li>Your general credibility</li>
</ul><p>If you have already been subject to persecution or serious harm you may not
have documentary or other evidence to support this. In this situation, the
international protection officer will not need confirmation of this if
convinced that: </p>
<ul><li>You made a genuine effort to prove what you said in your application </li>
  <li>You provided all the evidence you had available and gave a reasonable
    explanation for not having other relevant evidence </li>
  <li>Your statements were coherent and plausible </li>
  <li>If you did not apply for international protection at the earliest
    possible time, you gave a reasonable explanation for not doing so •Your
    general credibility has been established</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lf7ec9">Examination of your application</h2>

<p>The international protection officer will examine your application, to
decide what to recommend in your case. The 3 options for the recommendation
are: </p>
<ul><li>That you should be given a refugee declaration or </li>
  <li>That you should be given a subsidiary protection declaration or </li>
  <li>That you should be given neither of these declarations </li>
</ul><p>You will be interviewed as part of the examination of your application. You
will be notified in writing of a time, a date and a place to attend for a
personal interview. </p>

<p>If you do not attend for a personal interview on a date and at a time fixed
and you do not provide the Minister for Justice and Equality with an
explanation (not later than 3 working days from that date) that is reasonable
in the opinion of the Minister, your application will be considered based only
on information you have already provided. </p>

<p>If you require an interpreter, every reasonable effort will be made to
provide one in a language that you can use. </p>

<p>The Minister will ensure that, as far as possible, the interviewer is
competent to take account of the personal and general circumstances of your
application. If you wish, your legal representative may be present at the
interview. </p>

<p>There may not be a personal interview if the international protection
officer considers that: </p>
<ul><li>Based on the available evidence, the applicant should be given a refugee
    declaration </li>
  <li>An applicant aged under 18 is not mature enough for an interview to be
    useful </li>
  <li>The applicant is unfit or unable to be interviewed due to enduring
    circumstances beyond their control</li>
</ul><p>Following the interview, the international protection officer will prepare a
written report. </p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l4c09b">Recommendation of the international
protection officer</h2>

<p>At the end of the examination, the international protection officer will
prepare a written report, which will include a recommendation on your
application. The report will be based on the matters that you have raised, both
in writing and at your interview. The report will also take into account other
matters that the officer considers appropriate, for example, information in
relation to the situation in your country of origin or representations made by
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in connection with
your application. </p>

<p>The international protection officer’s recommendation, under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/section/39/enacted/en/html#sec39">section
39 (3)</a> of the Act, will be one of the following: </p>

<p>(a) You should be given a refugee declaration </p>

<p>(b) You should not be given a refugee declaration and should be given a
subsidiary protection declaration </p>

<p>(c) You should be given neither a refugee declaration nor a subsidiary
protection declaration. </p>

<p>The report will be sent to the Minister for Justice and Equality, who will
send you written notification of the recommendation. If the recommendation is
not made within 6 months of the date of your application, the Minister will
provide, on your request, information on the estimated time it will take to
make a recommendation. </p>

<p>If the international protection officer recommends that you should be given
a refugee declaration, the Minister for Justice and Equality will give you this
declaration. You can read more in our document on <a href="minister_for_justice.html">decisions on international protection made
by the Minister for Justice and Equality</a>. </p>

<p>If the international protection officer recommends that you should be given
either a subsidiary protection declaration or no declaration, a copy of the
report will be sent to you. You may appeal to the International Protection
Appeals Tribunal against the recommendation. You can read more about this in
our document, <a href="if_your_application_for_refugee_status_is_refused.html">If your
application for international protection in Ireland is refused</a>. </p>

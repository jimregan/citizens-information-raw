<p>The <a href="http://www.orac.ie/website/orac/oracwebsite.nsf/page/eudublinIIIregulation-main-en">Dublin
III Regulation</a> provides a mechanism for determining which country is
responsible for examining an application for international protection that has
been lodged in one of the member states by a third country national or a
stateless person. The Dublin III Regulation applies to the 28 EU member states,
Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. In this document, they are
referred to as the <em>Dublin countries</em>.</p>

<p>When you make your <a href="applying_for_refugee_status_in_ireland.html">application for
international protection</a>, you will have an initial interview with an
international protection officer to establish basic information and advise you
of your rights. Your case may also be examined under the Dublin III Regulation
to see whether it should be transferred to another Dublin country. It is open
to you to make written representations, in this regard, to the International
Protection Office – see 'Where to apply' below.</p>

<p>The international protection officer shall take into consideration all
relevant matters known to them, including any representations made by you or on
your behalf, when deciding whether your application will be transferred. You
will then be issued with a written determination of the outcome.</p>

<h3>Consideration of your application under the Dublin III Regulation</h3>

<p>In some cases, applicants may be required to participate in a separate
interview relating to an application under the Dublin III Regulation. However,
more usually, such information will be gathered during the course of the
initial interview or as a result of fingerprint evidence.</p>

<p>If, at any stage during the investigation of your application, it appears
that your application should be dealt with in another Dublin country, it may be
dealt with in accordance with the Regulation.</p>

<p>Your case may be one where Ireland requests another Dublin country to
<em>take charge</em> of your application. Examples of this are where another
country has issued you with a visa or work permit, or if you irregularly
crossed the frontier of another Dublin country before applying for
international protection in Ireland.</p>

<p>Alternatively, Ireland may request that another Dublin country <em>take
back</em> your application because, for example, you have made an international
protection claim in another Dublin country and that claim has not yet been
finalised; or you withdrew your international protection claim in that country;
or your application for international protection was rejected and you are in
Ireland without permission.</p>

<p>A summary of the different time limits to <em>take charge</em> and <em>take
back</em> cases is set out as follows:</p>

<h3>Take charge</h3>

<p>A request to another Dublin country to <em>take charge</em> of your
application (to accept responsibility for it) must be made within 3 months from
the date of your application. The requested country must give a decision no
later than 2 months from the date on which it received the request.</p>

<p>If Ireland does not make the request within the period of 3 months,
responsibility for your application lies with Ireland.</p>

<p>Ireland may ask for an urgent reply from the requested country if you were
refused leave to enter or to remain in Ireland. Also, Ireland can make an
urgent request if you have been arrested for unlawful stay; or after the
service or execution of a removal order; and/or where you are held in
detention. The request shall state the reasons warranting the urgent reply and
the period within which a reply is expected. This period shall be at least one
week and no longer than one month.</p>

<p>If the requested country fails to act within the 2-month period or the
one-month period referred to above, this is tantamount to the requested
country's acceptance of Ireland's request to take charge of your
application.</p>

<h3>Take back</h3>

<p>A <em>take back</em> request to another Dublin country to take
responsibility for your application must be made within 2 months of receipt of
a hit on the <a href="eurodac_system.html">Eurodac</a> system – which
records the fingerprints of applicants and can identify whether you have
already applied for international protection in another Dublin country. If the
take back request is based on other evidence, it shall be sent to the other
Dublin country within 3 months of the date on which Ireland becomes aware that
another Dublin country may be responsible for your application.</p>

<p>Where Ireland calls on another Dublin country to take back your application
for international protection, the other Dublin country shall be obliged to make
the necessary checks. It is also required to reply to Ireland’s request as
quickly as possible and no later than one month from the date of the
request.</p>

<p>Where Ireland's request is based on data obtained from the Eurodac system,
the one-month time limit referred to above is reduced to 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Where the requested country does not respond to Ireland's request to take
back within the one-month period or the 2-week period referred to above, the
requested country shall be considered to have agreed to take back your
application for international protection.</p>

<p>If another Dublin country is found to be responsible for examining your
application and it agrees to accept responsibility for the transfer of your
application, you will be informed immediately (in writing) that it is proposed
to transfer you to that country for consideration of your application.</p>

<h3>Family unity</h3>

<p>Note that Ireland may also call on and agree with another Dublin country to
take charge of your spouse and or your minor dependent children, in addition to
your application, even if your spouse or minor dependent children did not make
an international protection application in the Dublin country that is
responsible for your international protection application.</p>

<h3>Transfer to another Dublin country</h3>

<p>The transfer of your international protection claim will be arranged by the
Department of Justice and Equality. It will take place as soon as is
practicably possible and, at the latest, within 6 months of acceptance by the
other Dublin country. The Minister for Justice and Equality will be notified of
the determination with a view to making arrangements for your transfer to the
Dublin country concerned.</p>

<h3>Dublin III Regulation appeal</h3>

<p>Following the date of the determination, you will have 15 working days to
appeal to the International Protection Appeals Tribunal. You will be provided
with an information leaflet and a notice of appeal for that purpose. Any appeal
that you submit will suspend the transfer of your application, pending the
outcome of your appeal.</p>

<p>If the International Protection Appeals Tribunal overturns the determination
of the international protection officer, your application will be returned by
the International Protection Appeals Tribunal to the International Protection
Office for examination. You will receive a written notification advising you of
this.</p>

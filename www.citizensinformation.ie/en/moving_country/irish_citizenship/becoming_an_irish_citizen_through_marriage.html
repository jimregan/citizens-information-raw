<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are a foreign national who is the spouse or civil partner of an Irish
citizen, you may be able to become an Irish citizen if you meet certain
conditions. Foreign nationals married to or in a civil partnership with Irish
citizens can apply for citizenship <a shape="rect" href="becoming_an_irish_citizen_through_naturalisation.html">through
naturalisation</a>. The application process is the same as for foreign
nationals who are not the spouses or civil partners of Irish citizens but there
are more favourable residence requirements. The Minister for Justice and
Equality has discretion to grant or refuse your application.</p>

<p>You must use the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/citizenship-naturalisation-forms">current
versions of the application forms on the INIS website</a> - see 'How to apply'
below. There is an application fee of €175 - see 'Rates' below.</p>

<p><strong>Public Services Card:</strong> From 19 September 2016, if you are
applying for naturalisation and you are resident in the State, you must be
registered with the Department of Social Protection for a <a href="../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/public_services_card.html">Public
Services Card</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you are the spouse or civil partner of an Irish citizen who is applying
for Irish citizenship, you must meet the following conditions: </p>
<ul><li>You must be married to or in a recognised civil partnership* with the
    Irish citizen for at least 3 years </li>
  <li>You must have had a period of 1 year's continuous <em>reckonable
    residence</em> - see below - in the island of Ireland immediately before
    the date of your application, and during the 4 years preceding that, have
    had a total reckonable residence in the island of Ireland amounting to 2
    years. Altogether you must have a total of 3 years reckonable residence out
    of the last 5 years. </li>
  <li>Your marriage or civil partnership must be recognised as valid under
    Irish law </li>
  <li>You and your spouse or civil partner must be living together as husband
    and wife or civil partners </li>
  <li>You must be of full age, good character and intend to continue to live on
    the island of Ireland </li>
  <li>You must have made a declaration of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to
    the State. </li>
</ul><p>*<a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Civil%20Partnership">Foreign
relationships registered outside Ireland</a> were only recognised by the State
on 13 January 2011 when the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and
Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 came into force. However, under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/35/enacted/en/html">Marriage
Act 2015</a>, it is now possible for same-sex couples to become legally married
and you can no longer register a civil partnership in Ireland. Partnerships
registered abroad after 16 November 2015 are not recognised as civil
partnerships in Ireland.</p>

<h3>Reckonable residence</h3>

<p>Certain periods of residence do not count for the purpose of reckonable
residence, for example, periods when you did not have <a href="../moving_to_ireland/rights_of_residence_in_ireland/registration_of_non_eea_nationals_in_ireland.html">permission
to remain in Ireland</a>, or you had permission that was for study purposes or
while having a claim for asylum examined. You can use the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Naturalisation_Residency_Calculator">online
residency calculator on the INIS website</a> to check if you meet the
naturalisation residency conditions.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>If you have previously been married and divorced</h3>

<p>You can only claim citizenship by marriage or civil partnership if your
current <a href="../../birth_family_relationships/getting_married/legal_prerequisites_for_marriage.html">marriage</a>
or <a href="../../birth_family_relationships/civil_partnerships/civil_partnership_and_same_sex_couples.html">civil
partnership</a> is valid under Irish law.</p>

<h3>Processing your application for citizenship</h3>

<p>You will be informed by registered post when the decision is made on your
application. Generally most applications will be processed within 6 months.</p>

<p>If your application is approved, the letter notifying you of this decision
will contain instructions regarding the final procedures that must be completed
before the certificate of naturalisation can be issued. When you submit the
required documentation and certification fee, you will be invited to a
citizenship ceremony at which you will be granted your certificate of
naturalisation.</p>

<p>You can <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/travel_abroad/passports/applying_for_or_renewing_an_irish_passport.html">apply
for an Irish passport</a> following the confirmation of your Irish citizenship
and the receipt of your citizenship certificate.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The fee for an <strong>application for naturalisation</strong> is €175</p>

<p><strong></strong>When the <strong>certificate of naturalisation</strong> is
issued you pay a fee of €950.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You must use the current versions of the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/citizenship-naturalisation-forms">application
forms on the INIS website</a>. You apply using <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Form%208%20Ver%205.5%20Aug%2016.pdf/Files/Form%208%20Ver%205.5%20Aug%2016.pdf">Form
8 (pdf)</a> which is available from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration
Service (INIS). </p>

<p>The supporting documents required include evidence of your identity and
nationality (birth certificate and passport). From 19 September 2016, if you
are applying for naturalisation and you are resident in the State, you must be
<a href="../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/public_services_card.html">registered
for a Public Services Card</a>.</p>

<p>You will also need to produce documents relating to your status and the
duration of your stay in the State, for example, your Certificate of
Registration, declaration of refugee status. </p>

<h3>Spouse or civil partner of an Irish citizen</h3>

<p>As your application for naturalisation is based on your marriage to or civil
partnership with an Irish citizen, you will need to produce the documents
needed to show your spouse’s or civil partner's status and evidence of your
marital or civil partner status (for example, birth or naturalisation
certificate of Irish spouse, marriage or civil registration certificate). In
the application form your spouse or civil partner must complete a sworn
affidavit that you are living together as husband and wife or civil partners.
</p>

<p>As well as these documents, you must produce documents relevant to your
financial and employment status (payslips for the previous 3 months, bank
statements for the previous 3 months) and confirmation of your income tax
situation. </p>

<p>You should only send copies of the above documents with your application
form. The copies of birth, marriage, civil partnership and divorce certificates
must be <strong><a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/policy-certify-document">certified
documents</a></strong>. You will be expected to produce the original documents
for inspection at a later stage during the examination of your application.</p>

<p>The information in your application form will be checked against the
supporting documentation and any inaccuracy will lead to delays in ruling on
your application.</p>

<p>You should not sign the form until you are in the presence of the person who
must witness you signing it. The application form contains instructions about
who is eligible to be a witness. <br></p>

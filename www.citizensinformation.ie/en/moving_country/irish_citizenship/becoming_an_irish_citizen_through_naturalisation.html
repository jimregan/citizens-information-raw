<h3>What is naturalisation?</h3>

<p>Naturalisation means the process whereby a foreign national living in
Ireland may apply to become an Irish citizen. In order to apply for
naturalisation in Ireland, you must have been physically resident in Ireland
for a certain length of time. </p>

<p>All applications to become a naturalised Irish citizen are decided by the
Minister for Justice and Equality. This Minister has absolute discretion as to
whether or not to grant naturalisation. There are strict rules about applying
for naturalisation as an Irish citizen and these rules are set out below.</p>

<p>You must use the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/citizenship-naturalisation-forms">current
versions of the application forms on the INIS website</a> - see 'How to apply'
below. There is an application fee of €175 - see 'Rates' below.</p>

<p><strong>Public Services Card:</strong> Since 19 September 2016, if you are
applying for naturalisation and you are resident in the State, you must be
registered with the Department of Social Protection for a <a href="../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/public_services_card.html">Public
Services Card</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Who is eligible for naturalisation?</h3>

<p>If you wish to become an Irish citizen through naturalisation, you must:</p>
<ul><li>Be 18 years or older (you must be married if you are under the age of 18)
    or, </li>
  <li>Be a minor born in the State (from 1 January 2005) and </li>
  <li>Be of good character - the Garda Síochána (Ireland's national police)
    will be asked to provide a report about your background. Any criminal
    record or ongoing proceedings will be taken into consideration by the
    Minister for Justice and Equality in deciding whether or not to grant
    naturalisation. Details of any proceedings, criminal or civil, in the State
    or elsewhere, should be disclosed in the application form, and </li>
  <li>Have had a period of 365 days* (1 year) continuous reckonable residence
    in the State immediately before the date of your application for
    naturalisation and, during the 8 years preceding that, have had a total
    reckonable residence in the State amounting to 1,460 days* (4 years).
    Altogether you must have 5 years (5 x 365 days*) reckonable residence out
    of the last 9 years - see ‘calculating reckonable residence’ below,
  and</li>
  <li>Intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after
    naturalisation and </li>
  <li>Make a declaration of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State,
    and undertake to observe the laws of the State and respect its democratic
    values (see below for the point in the process at which this is required).
  </li>
</ul><p>*You must add 1 day for any period which includes 29 February.</p>

<p>Normally, when you apply for naturalisation you must be supporting yourself
and your dependants while living in Ireland - see 'Self supporting' below.</p>

<p>The Minister for Justice and Equality has power to waive one or more of the
conditions for naturalisation in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul><li>If you are of Irish descent or of Irish associations or are a parent or
    guardian applying on behalf of a minor child of Irish descent or Irish
    associations </li>
  <li>If you have an <a shape="rect" href="irish_citizenship_through_birth_or_descent.html">entitlement to Irish
    citizenship if you were born on the island of Ireland</a> </li>
  <li>If you are a naturalised parent applying on behalf of a minor child </li>
  <li>If you are the <a shape="rect" href="becoming_an_irish_citizen_through_marriage.html">spouse or civil
    partner of an Irish citizen</a> or a naturalised person </li>
  <li>If you have been resident abroad in the public service </li>
  <li>If you are <a shape="rect" href="../asylum_seekers_and_refugees/the_asylum_process_in_ireland/refugees_asylum_seekers_introduction.html">recognised
    as a refugee</a> (under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49da0e466.html">1951 Geneva Convention
    relating to the Status of Refugees</a>) or a stateless person (under the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/protection/statelessness/3bbb25729/convention-relating-status-stateless-persons.html">1954
    UN Convention regarding Stateless Persons</a>). </li>
</ul><p>In the case of a refugee, stateless person or a person of Irish
associations, the Minister will normally waive 2 of the 5 years' reckonable
residence requirement.</p>

<h3>Calculating reckonable residence</h3>

<p><em>Reckonable residence</em> means periods of residence taken into account
when examining an application for naturalisation. Certain periods of residence
may be excluded from the reckoning when calculating periods of residence in the
State. These are periods when your presence in the State was not properly
documented or (in certain cases) periods covered by a permission to remain that
was for study purposes or while having a claim for asylum examined. You can use
the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Naturalisation_Residency_Calculator">online
residency calculator on the INIS website</a> to check if you meet the
naturalisation residency conditions.</p>

<p><strong>EEA nationals:</strong> The time that a EEA or Swiss citizen has
spent in the State is reckonable for naturalisation purposes as EEA and Swiss
citizens are not required to have residence permits or documents under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2015/en/si/0548.html">European Communities
(Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2015.</a> The European Economic Area
(EEA) comprises the EU member states, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.</p>

<p><strong>Non-EEA nationals:</strong> If you are not an EEA or Swiss citizen,
any time when you did not have permission to remain in the State will not be
counted as reckonable residence. <a shape="rect" href="../moving_to_ireland/rights_of_residence_in_ireland/registration_of_non_eea_nationals_in_ireland.html">Registration
with immigration</a> is the evidence of legal residence which meets the
residency requirements for naturalisation. The following periods of residence
will not be reckoned if the permission to remain:</p>
<ul><li>Was for the purposes of study (that is, you were on a student visa)
    whether or not that study involved you being employed during any of the
    period of study, or </li>
  <li>Was granted while your claim for asylum was being examined, if the claim
    was not granted. </li>
</ul><p></p>

<p><strong>Refugees</strong></p>

<p>A person granted <a href="../asylum_seekers_and_refugees/refugee_status_and_leave_to_remain/rights_of_convention_programme_refugees_people_given_leave_to_remain.html">Refugee
Status</a> can apply for citizenship through naturalisation once they have
acquired 3 years of reckonable residency. Residency is calculated from the date
of arrival in the State. A person can be absent from the State for up to 6
weeks in total in any one year without it having any consequence on their
application.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Self supporting</h3>

<p>In general, apart from refugees and stateless persons, applicants for
naturalisation must prove they can support themselves and their families while
living in Ireland. If you can show that you have not received State support in
the 3 years before your application, this will generally meet the Minister for
Justice and Equality's requirement that you have been supporting yourself and
your dependants and that you will continue to do so.</p>

<h3>How your application for naturalisation is processed</h3>

<p>You will normally be informed within a week whether your application has
passed the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP16000022#after-you-apply">initial
processing stage</a>. If your application passes the initial stage, it is then
processed further along with all other applications that are on hand. You will
be given a reference number and you should quote this number when making
queries either by phone or in writing. </p>

<p>For incorrect or incomplete applications, the process is longer, but you can
keep it as short as possible by replying quickly to any queries. If further
documentation or clarification is needed, you will be asked for it once
processing of your application has begun. </p>

<p>You will be informed by registered post as soon as a decision has been made
on your application. Generally most applications will be processed within 6
months.</p>

<h3>Certificate of naturalisation</h3>

<p>If your application is approved, the letter notifying you of this decision
will contain instructions regarding the final procedures that must be completed
before the certificate of naturalisation can be issued. When you submit the
required documentation and certification fee, you will be invited to a <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/citizenship-ceremonies">citizenship
ceremony</a> at which you will be granted your certificate of
naturalisation.</p>

<p>You are an Irish citizen from the date of issue of the certificate and you
can apply to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for an <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/travel_abroad/passports/applying_for_or_renewing_an_irish_passport.html">Irish
passport</a> any time after that date. The certificate of naturalisation is
written in Irish. The English version is Form 11 in the schedule of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/si/0284.html">Irish Nationality
and Citizenship (Amendment) Regulations 2011</a>.</p>

<h3>Revoking citizenship</h3>

<p>The Minister for Justice and Equality can revoke your certificate of
naturalisation if:</p>
<ul><li>You obtained it through fraud, misrepresentation or concealment of
    material facts or circumstances </li>
  <li>You have, through an overt act, failed in your duty of fidelity to the
    nation and loyalty to the State </li>
  <li>You were ordinarily resident outside Ireland (other than in public
    service) for a continuous period of 7 years and, without a reasonable
    excuse, did not register your name and a declaration of your intention to
    retain <span>Irish</span> citizenship with an <span>Irish</span> diplomatic
    mission or consular office or with the Minister for Justice and Equality on
    an annual basis - see 'How to apply' below.</li>
  <li>You are also, under the law of a country at war with the State, a citizen
    of that country </li>
  <li>You have, by any other voluntary act other than marriage or registration
    of civil partnership, acquired citizenship of another country. </li>
</ul><p>Before revoking your certificate of naturalisation, the Minister for Justice
and Equality will inform you in advance, stating the reasons why the
certificate is being revoked and your right to apply to the Minister for an
inquiry into the reasons for the revocation. If you apply for an inquiry into a
decision to revoke your certificate of naturalisation, the Minister will refer
your case to a Committee of Inquiry, which will report its findings to the
Minister. A notice of the revocation of your certificate of naturalisation will
be published in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irisoifigiuil.ie/">Iris
Oifigiúil</a> (Ireland's official State Gazette). </p>

<p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>

<p>The supporting documents required depend on your situation; you will need to
provide evidence of your identity and nationality (long-form birth certificate
and passport). If you are aged 18 or over and applying for naturalisation you
must provide, the original of your current passport and any previous passports
valid during periods of residence in the State, together with a photocopy of
the biometric page of each passport. Allow at least 4 weeks for your passport
to be returned to you. Since 19 September 2016, if you are resident in the
State, you must be registered for a Public Services Card (PSC) and you must
include a copy of your PSC with your application form.</p>

<p>You also need to produce documents relating to your status and the duration
of your stay in the State (Certificate of Registration, declaration of refugee
status, or the like). If you are a non-EEA national applying for naturalisation
<a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/registration-stamps">your
residency stamps are the only evidence which provide proof of your reckonable
residence.</a> </p>

<p>If your application for naturalisation is based on your relationship to an
Irish citizen, you will need to produce the documents needed to show that
person's status and your relationship to that person (for example birth or
naturalisation certificate of Irish spouse, marriage certificate, civil
partnership certificate). </p>

<p>The copies of birth, marriage, civil partnership, divorce and other
certificates, such as the photo page of your passport, must be <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/policy-certify-document">certified
documents</a>. You will be expected to produce the original documents for
inspection at a later stage during the examination of your application. </p>

<p>As well as these documents, if you are 18 or over and applying for
naturalisation, you must produce documents relevant to your financial and
employment status (copies of 3 pay slips and 3 bank statements dated within the
previous 6 months) and confirmation of your income tax situation. You should
only send copies of the above documents with your application form.</p>

<p>The information in your application form will be checked against the
supporting documentation and any inaccuracy will lead to delays in ruling on
your application. </p>

<p><span>You should not sign</span> the form until you are in the presence of
the person who must witness you signing it. The application form contains
instructions about who is eligible to be a witness. </p>

<p><strong>Lost or stolen certificate of naturalisation</strong></p>

<p>If your certificate of naturalisation is lost or stolen, you should write to
the Citizenship Division of INIS – see ‘Where to apply’ below. You will
not get a replacement certificate but instead you will be given a statement
confirming your Irish citizenship. There is no fee for this service. If you are
applying for an Irish passport you will need this statement to accompany your
passport application.</p>

<p>Irish citizens are formal members of the Irish community, that is, the Irish
community living in Ireland and the Irish community living abroad. Being an
Irish citizen means that you are legally recognised as being a national of
Ireland and a citizen of the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/european_government/european_union.html">European
Union</a>. </p>

<p><strong>UK referendum:</strong> Following the UK vote to leave the European
Union, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has published a list of <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/irelanduk-citizenshipandpassports/">frequently asked
questions on citizenship and passports</a> for Irish and UK citizens.</p>

<h3>Rights of Irish citizens</h3>

<p>Irish citizens (in common with all citizens living in Ireland) enjoy certain
rights and privileges that are guaranteed under the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Irish
Constitution</a>. Some of these rights are <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/irish_constitution_1/constitution_fundamental_rights.html">fundamental
rights</a> that arise from living in Ireland. For example, if you are a citizen
living in Ireland, you are entitled to equality before the law, freedom to
travel, freedom of expression and religious liberty. </p>

<p>If you are an Irish citizen, you are entitled to carry an <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/travel_abroad/passports/applying_for_or_renewing_an_irish_passport.html">Irish
passport</a> and leave Ireland to travel abroad, to <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/elections_and_referenda/national_elections/the_general_election.html">vote
in an Irish election</a> and to be elected to government in Ireland and in the
European Union. As an Irish citizen, you are also entitled to live, travel and
work within the European Union/European Economic Area. </p>

<p>As an Irish citizen living in Ireland, you also have certain duties and
responsibilities. For example, you are expected to observe and uphold the basic
rule of law in Ireland and to <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courtroom/jury_service.html">serve on a jury</a> if called upon.
</p>

<p>If you are an Irish citizen living outside of Ireland, you are also entitled
to an Irish passport, as well as <a shape="rect" href="../moving_abroad/leaving_ireland/diplomatic_supports.html">diplomatic
supports from Irish embassies/consulates abroad</a>, etc. With the exception of
diplomatic staff and their spouses or civil partners posted abroad, as an Irish
citizen living abroad you are <strong>not</strong> entitled to vote in an Irish
election by post or in your nearest Irish embassy.</p>

<h3>How can I become an Irish citizen?</h3>

<p>Irish citizenship is obtained in different ways. Most Irish citizens get
their citizenship through <a shape="rect" href="irish_citizenship_through_birth_or_descent.html">birth or descent</a>.
Foreign nationals can apply to become Irish citizens through <a shape="rect" href="becoming_an_irish_citizen_through_naturalisation.html">naturalisation</a>.
If you are a foreign national who is either married to an Irish citizen or a
civil partner of an Irish citizen, you can apply for Irish citizenship through
naturalisation. The residence requirements are more favourable for the <a href="becoming_an_irish_citizen_through_marriage.html">spouse or civil
partner of an Irish citizen</a> but there is no longer an absolute entitlement
to Irish citizenship through marriage.</p>

<h3>Dual citizenship</h3>

<p>If you are an Irish citizen, you may also hold dual citizenship, that is,
citizenship of another country. You should be aware that certain countries do
not recognise dual citizenship. If you wish to apply for dual citizenship, you
should check with the authorities of the other country to ensure that your
rights are protected. For example, the law in some countries provides for the
automatic termination of its citizenship or nationality if you acquire another
citizenship or nationality. You should also be aware that acquiring Irish
citizenship <span>does not automatically</span> void the obligations of another
citizenship or nationality (for example, the requirement to complete military
service).</p>

<h3>Renouncing your Irish citizenship</h3>

<p>If you are an Irish citizen living abroad, and you wish to apply for
citizenship of another country you may be required to renounce your Irish
citizenship. If you have done this by making a <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Form%2013%20(Ver%205.0%20Jan%2014).pdf/Files/Form%2013%20(Ver%205.0%20Jan%2014).pdf">declaration
of alienage (pdf)</a> that you are no longer an Irish citizen this does not
affect your entitlement to be an Irish citizen if you are born in Ireland. You
can resume your Irish citizenship by making a <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Form%201%20(Ver%205.0%20Jan%202014).pdf/Files/Form%201%20(Ver%205.0%20Jan%202014).pdf">declaration
of citizenship (pdf).</a></p>

<p>Irish citizenship through birth or descent is a complex area. This document
aims to explain the law regarding Irish citizenship as clearly as possible. It
includes information regarding children born to foreign nationals, foreign
births and registration procedures. Further information regarding Irish
citizenship through birth, descent, <a shape="rect" href="becoming_an_irish_citizen_through_naturalisation.html">naturalisation</a>
and following <a shape="rect" href="becoming_an_irish_citizen_through_marriage.html">marriage</a> is
available from your nearest Irish embassy or consulate – see 'Where to apply'
below. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lb999d">Born in Ireland</h2>

<p>If you were born on the island of Ireland before 1 January 2005, you are
entitled to be an Irish citizen.</p>

<h3>Irish citizen parents</h3>

<p>If you were born in Ireland after 1 January 2005 and your parent(s) were
Irish citizens, then you are also an Irish citizen. </p>

<p>However, in certain circumstances some people born in Ireland have to claim
Irish citizenship. You can find more details about claiming Irish citizenship
through special declaration in 'Further information' below.</p>

<h3>Foreign national parents</h3>

<p>A child born in the island of Ireland on or after 1 January 2005 is entitled
to Irish citizenship if they have a British parent or a parent who is entitled
to live in Northern Ireland or the Irish State without restriction on their
residency. A child born in Ireland to a parent who has been granted refugee
status is also automatically entitled to Irish citizenship.</p>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0038/index.html">Irish
Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004,</a> children born of other foreign
national parents in the island of Ireland on or after 1 January 2005 are not
automatically entitled to Irish citizenship. These parents must prove that they
have a <strong>genuine</strong> link to Ireland. This will be evidenced by
their having 3 out of the previous 4 years reckonable residence in the island
of Ireland immediately before the birth of the child. On proof of a genuine
link to Ireland their child will be entitled to Irish citizenship and they can
<a href="../../travel_and_recreation/travel_abroad/passports/passports_for_children.html">apply
for an Irish passport for their child</a> - see 'How to apply' below. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l091af">Born outside Ireland</h2>

<h3>Irish citizen parents born in Ireland</h3>

<p>If either of your parents was an Irish citizen who was born in Ireland, then
you are automatically an Irish citizen, irrespective of your place of birth. If
you are an Irish citizen, you can <a href="../../travel_and_recreation/travel_abroad/passports/applying_for_or_renewing_an_irish_passport.html">apply
for an Irish passport</a>. You do not need an Irish passport in order to be an
Irish citizen but having an Irish passport is evidence that you are an Irish
citizen. </p>

<h3>Irish citizen parents born outside Ireland</h3>

<p>If you were born outside Ireland to an Irish citizen who was born outside
Ireland, then you are entitled to become an Irish citizen. </p>

<p>If your parent derived Irish citizenship in another manner, for example,
through marriage, adoption or naturalisation, and was an Irish citizen at the
time of your birth, you can become an Irish citizen.</p>

<p>If the parent through whom you derive Irish citizenship was deceased at the
time of your birth, but would have been an Irish citizen if alive at that time,
you are also an Irish citizen. Also, you derive citizenship through an Irish
parent whether or not your parents were married to each other at the time of
your birth. </p>

<p><strong>Claiming Irish citizenship:</strong> Before you can claim Irish
citizenship, you must have your birth registered in the Foreign Births Register
– see below. If you are entitled to register, your Irish citizenship is
effective from the date of registration – not from the date when you were
born. </p>

<h3>Citizenship through descent from Irish grandparents</h3>

<p>If one of your grandparents is an Irish citizen who was born in Ireland, but
neither of your parents was born in Ireland, you may become an Irish citizen.
You will need to have your birth registered in the Foreign Births Register –
see below.</p>

<h3>Other Irish ancestors</h3>

<p>Unless at least one parent or an Irish-born grandparent was an Irish citizen
at the time of your birth, you cannot claim Irish citizenship on the basis of
extended previous ancestry (that is, ancestors other than your parents or
grandparents). In addition, you cannot claim Irish citizenship on the basis
that a relation such as a cousin, aunt or uncle was an Irish citizen if none of
your parents or grandparents was an Irish citizen at the time of your birth.</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/citizenship-by-birth-descent">online
tool on the INIS website</a> to check if you are an Irish citizen by birth or
decent. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Irish citizenship through adoption</h3>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1956/en/act/pub/0026/sec0011.html#sec11">Irish
Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956</a>, if a child who is not an Irish
citizen is <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/adoption_and_fostering/adopting_a_child.html">adopted</a>
by an Irish citizen or a couple where either spouse is an Irish citizen, then
the adopted child shall be an Irish citizen. </p>

<p>If an Irish citizen who is living abroad adopts child abroad, they should
apply for the adoption to be entered in the <a href="http://aai.gov.ie/adoption/intercountry/register-a-foreign-adoption.html">Register
of Intercountry Adoptions</a>. Once it is registered, the adoption has the same
legal status as if the adoption was made in the State.</p>

<p>If an Irish citizen living in the State adopts a child from outside the
State, <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Foreign%20Adoption">immigration
procedures must be observed</a>. In order for the adopted child to enter the
State, immigration clearance must be obtained in advance from the Department of
Justice and Equality. This clearance will only be granted once the adoptive
parent(s) proposing to adopt abroad have successfully completed the assessment
procedure and have had a declaration made in their favour by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.aai.gov.ie/">Adoption Authority of Ireland</a>.
<a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/adoption_and_fostering/intercountry_adoption.html">This
process is known as intercountry adoption</a>. </p>

<h3>Deserted infants</h3>

<p>Every deserted infant first found in Ireland will, unless the contrary is
proved, (that is, the parents of the child come forward and clarify that the
child is not Irish) be considered to have been born in Ireland. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l97318">Foreign Births Register</h2>

<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains the Foreign Births
Register where people who are eligible to become Irish citizens can register
their birth. If you have a grandparent born in Ireland or if your parent was
granted Irish citizenship or was deemed to be an Irish citizen before you were
born, then you can apply to register in the Foreign Births Register – see
‘How to apply’ below.</p>

<p>If you are entitled to register, your Irish citizenship is effective from
the date of registration. The Irish citizenship of successive generations may
be maintained in this way by each generation ensuring their registration in the
Foreign Births Register <strong>before the birth of the next generation.
</strong></p>

<p>Since 1 July 1986, a person registered in the Foreign Births Entry Book
after 1986 is deemed to be an Irish citizen only from the date of their entry
in the Register and not from the date of birth. This means that children born
to that person before their date of entry in the Register are
<strong></strong>not entitled to citizenship. </p>

<p>People registered before July 1986 are deemed Irish citizens either from the
date the original Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act came into force, that
is, 17 July 1956, or their date of birth, whichever is later. Only children
born after 17 July 1956 can claim citizenship in such cases. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<h3>Foreign Births Register</h3>

<p>If you wish to be included in the <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/passports-citizenship/citizenship/born-abroad/">Foreign
Births Register</a> you must use the online application facility. You can find
information about <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/passports-citizenship/citizenship/born-abroad/registering-a-foreign-birth/">making
an online application, the documents required, the photographic requirements
and the fees</a> on the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs and
Trade.</p>

<p>Once you have completed the online form you must send your printed
application and required supporting documentation to the Irish embassy or
consulate for the country in which you live – see 'Where to apply' below. If
you are resident in Ireland you must send your application to the Consular
Section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin – see
‘Where to apply’ below.</p>

<p>Once the process is completed, you will be provided with a certificate
confirming your entry in the Irish Register of Foreign Births. This certificate
can be used as proof of Irish citizenship when <a href="../../travel_and_recreation/travel_abroad/passports/applying_for_or_renewing_an_irish_passport.html">applying
for an Irish passport</a>. </p>

<p>Please note that Irish passport applications cannot be accepted at the same
time as citizenship applications - these are 2 very distinct processes. </p>

<h3>Passport for an Irish-born child of foreign national parents</h3>

<p><strong>Non-EEA nationals</strong></p>

<p><strong>Residence in Ireland:</strong> Non-EEA nationals must provide
evidence of residence. Their passport application must include a letter listing
their passport's immigration stamps which detail their residence in Ireland and
their Certificate of Registration (GNIB card).</p>

<p><strong>Residence in Northern Ireland: </strong>Non-EEA nationals who have
permission to live in the UK must apply to the Department of Justice and
Equality for a certificate of nationality for their Irish-born child. The
letter of application must be accompanied by a completed <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Form%20C%20(Ver%203.0%20Jan%202014).pdf/Files/Form%20C%20(Ver%203.0%20Jan%202014).pdf">declaration
form C (pdf)</a> together with 2 documents for each of the 3 years giving proof
of address in Northern Ireland such as driving licence and utility bills. When
the certificate of Irish nationality for the child has been received by the
parents, they may then apply for an Irish passport for the child, using the
certificate of nationality as proof of Irish citizenship. </p>

<p><strong>EEA and Swiss nationals</strong></p>

<p>EEA and Swiss nationals who wish to apply for a Irish passport for their
child do not need a certificate of nationality. The passport application must
include a <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/media/dfa/alldfawebsitemedia/passportcitizenship/Declaration-Form-A.pdf">declaration
form A (pdf)</a> completed by the parent and a person such as a solicitor or
teacher who knows the parent. </p>

<h3>Claiming Irish citizenship through special declaration</h3>

<p>Some people may only claim Irish citizenship by making a declaration on a
special form. They include: </p>
<ul><li>A person born on the island of Ireland to a foreign national who at the
    time of that person's birth was entitled to diplomatic immunity within the
    State (for example, a foreign ambassador) </li>
  <li>A person born in Irish sea or air space to a foreign national on a
    foreign ship or in a foreign aircraft </li>
  <li>A person born on the island of Ireland who has made a declaration of
    alienage on <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Form%2013%20(Ver%205.0%20Jan%2014).pdf/Files/Form%2013%20(Ver%205.0%20Jan%2014).pdf">form

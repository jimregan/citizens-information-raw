<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Every year, thousands of citizens leave Ireland to work, travel, study or
retire abroad. Some people leave Ireland to work or study for a short period
(that is, a few months), other people go abroad for longer. Many others who
have been living, studying or working in Ireland also leave to return to their
home countries.</p>

<p>If you leave Ireland to live and/or work in another country, you may be
entitled to receive social security benefits in the country you are moving to.
You can find information about it in our document on <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/social_insurance_contributions_from_abroad.html">social
security arrangements that Ireland has with other countries.</a></p>

<p>Some Irish social welfare payments can be paid abroad – you can read more
in our document on <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/going_abroad_and_social_welfare_payments.html">going
abroad and social welfare payments.</a></p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l199dd">Countries covered by EU Regulations</h2>

<p>If you move to live or work in a country covered by <acronym title="European Union">EU</acronym> Regulations, this means that for social
security benefits or services, you are entitled to be treated in the same way
as the nationals in the <acronym title="European Union">EU</acronym> member
state or EEA country that you move to. On a practical level, this means that
you and your family are entitled to apply for any benefits or assistance
available in the country in which you reside. If you are applying for
insurance-based payments, any contributions made in other <acronym title="European Union">EU</acronym> member states or EEA countries should be
taken into account. </p>

<h3>Social insurance contribution record</h3>

<p>If you need to claim benefits while living abroad you will be asked to
provide information about your Irish social insurance record. </p>

<p>You can use forms E104 and U1 (formerly E301) when claiming sickness,
maternity or unemployment benefits abroad - see 'How to apply' below. The U1 is
called a <em>portable document</em> and it provides details of your <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">Irish
social insurance record</a>. </p>

<p>If you don’t bring your E104 or U1 with you, the country you have moved to
will contact Irish authorities to get a record of your insurance contributions
when you apply to them for unemployment, sickness or maternity benefits. A
request from another EU member state for your social insurance record will be
prioritised by the Department of Social Protection so that you don’t lose out
on any benefits due to you when abroad. </p>

<p>If you are returning to Ireland from a country in the EU or EEA, you should
bring an E104 and U1 form back with you as they will provide details of the
insurance contributions you made in that country. The forms are presented at
the relevant social security agency of the country you are living in when you
are making a claim.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>A request for an E104 or U1 by another EU member state is always prioritised
by the Department of Social Protection. This is because a person who is
unemployed or sick abroad has made a claim for benefit and it must be dealt
with as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>If you want to bring your E104 and U1 with you, you can <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/U1.pdf">request your Irish social insurance
record for E104 and U1 (pdf)</a> before leaving. Processing your application
can take some time as the DSP may have to contact your recent employer/s before
the E104 and U1 forms can be issued.</p>

<p>You should send the completed application form to the International Records
Section of the Department of Social Protection - see 'Where to apply' below.
With your application, you must include a copy of your P45, a copy of your P60
and remember to include your address abroad. </p>

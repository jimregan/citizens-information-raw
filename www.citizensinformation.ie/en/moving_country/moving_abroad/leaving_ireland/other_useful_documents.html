<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are leaving Ireland, you may be travelling for reasons of work,
study, holiday or retirement abroad. Whatever it is you intend to do, you will
need to take with you certain documentation (for example, proof of your
citizenship, identity, address in Ireland). It is always easier to get hold of
these documents while you are still in Ireland than retrospectively to seek
these items when you move abroad. </p>

<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has developed a <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/news-and-media/press-releases/press-release-archive/2016/june/minister-flanagan-launches-travelwise/">free
smartphone app called TravelWise</a> which has travel advice and consular
information on 200 countries. The app is available from the Apple and Android
stores.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="ldf4aa">Documents to bring with you</h2>

<p>It is always highly recommended that you bring your passport with you, even
if you are <a href="../freedom_of_movement_within_the_eu/common_travel_area_between_ireland_and_the_uk.html">travelling
to the UK</a> and your passport is not a requirement for travel. In fact, given
Ireland is not a member of the <a href="../freedom_of_movement_within_the_eu/free_movement_of_people_within_the_schengen_area.html">Schengen
Agreement,</a> you will find that you are required to carry your passport when
travelling to most other countries. If you need information about <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/travel_abroad/passports/applying_for_or_renewing_an_irish_passport.html">applying
for an Irish passport</a> you can find this information elsewhere on this site.
</p>

<p>In addition to your passport, other useful documents include:</p>
<ul><li>Your birth certificate </li>
  <li>Your <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/driver_licensing/full_driving_licence.html">driving
    licence</a> and/or <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/driver_licensing/international_driving_permit.html">international
    driving permit</a> </li>
  <li>Your student card </li>
  <li>Any visas or work permits you may need </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/travel_abroad/e111.html">European Health
    Insurance Card</a> and/or other documents relating to health insurance </li>
  <li>Your curriculum vitae </li>
  <li>Any relevant certificates from education or training courses you have
    completed </li>
  <li>References for work </li>
  <li>Emergency contact information</li>
  <li>Contact names and numbers of your family/friends/next-of-kin in Ireland
  </li>
</ul><p>If you are going to remote areas where you will be far from an Irish
embassy, leave two passport photographs and two signatures, ideally on a
passport application form, with friends in Ireland or near an Irish embassy. If
your passport is lost or stolen this could speed up the process of replacing
it. </p>

<p>Before you travel, it can be useful to make photocopies of the most
important of these documents. <span>Carry the photocopies separately</span> so
that you will have <span>some form of identification </span>in the event that
they are stolen. </p>

<p>If you are travelling in countries where there are a lot of restrictions, it
can be useful to bring a number of passport photographs with you, for use on
additional visas and permits. </p>

<h3>Documents</h3>

<p>When you are abroad, you may need to use Irish documents, for example, a
birth certificate, either for personal or business reasons. You may be asked to
have them authenticated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
Authenticating a document means verifying that a signature, seal or stamp on a
document is genuine. Another type of authentication is an <a href="http://www.notarypublic.ie/apostille-and-legalisation/">apostille
stamp</a> which is an international certification. It authenticates or legally
certifies a document and it may be required by countries that have acceded to
the <a href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php">Hague Convention</a>. You can
find more information about <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/travel/our-services/authenticating-documents/">authenticating
documents</a> on dfa.ie. </p>

<h3>Fingerprints </h3>

<p>If you are planning to travel to a country for which you need a visa, you
may be asked to provide fingerprints as part of your visa application. To get a
certificate of your fingerprints you should contact your local Garda station to
find out which Garda stations provide this service. It involves taking your
fingerprints and giving you a card with a set of your fingerprints and stamped
by the Garda station. </p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ldd274">Emergency contact details</h2>

<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade recommends that you make a note
of the contact details of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=285">nearest Irish embassy or
consulate</a> while you are abroad in case you need to contact them urgently.
You are also advised to leave your own contact details with someone at home who
can pass them to the <a shape="rect" href="https://www.dfa.ie/travel/our-services/">Consular Section of the
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</a> in the event of an emergency. You
could also <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=40332">register your contact details
with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</a>. </p>

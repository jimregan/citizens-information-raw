<p>If you are in need of advice or assistance while you are abroad, you can
call on the Irish embassy or consulate in that country. There are <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=285">Irish embassies
and consulates-general</a> located in countries throughout the world.</p>

<p>If you are in a country where there is no embassy or consulate, you may look
for advice and assistance from embassies or consulates of other European Union
countries.</p>

<p>Embassies and consulates can be of assistance if:</p>
<ul><li>You need an <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/travel/assistance-abroad/lost-or-stolen-passport-abroad/">emergency
    passport</a> </li>
  <li>You have been the <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/travel/assistance-abroad/victim-of-crime/">victim
    of crime</a> or illness or have had a serious accident </li>
  <li>You have been <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/travel/assistance-abroad/arrested-or-detained-abroad/">arrested
    or imprisoned</a> while abroad </li>
  <li>You need help in transferring funds from home where more conventional
    means are not available </li>
  <li>There is a <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/travel/assistance-abroad/death-abroad/">death
    abroad</a> and the remains need to be returned to Ireland. </li>
</ul><p>There is a limit to the services the embassy or consulate can provide. For
example, if you have been <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/travel/assistance-abroad/sick-or-injured-abroad/">ill
or in an accident</a>, they can:</p>
<ul><li>Inform family or friends about your accident or illness </li>
  <li>Advise on local medical services and lists of English-speaking doctors
  </li>
  <li>Liaise with local medical services on your behalf. </li>
</ul><p>They <span>cannot</span>, however, offer medical advice, pay medical bills
or pursue compensation claims on your behalf. Nor will they be able to pay for
relatives to come to see you. </p>

<p>Further information about the <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/travel/assistance-abroad/">range of services relating
to the consular protection of Irish citizens</a> is available from the Consular
Section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade â€“ see 'Where to apply'
below. The Department has also developed a <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/news-and-media/press-releases/press-release-archive/2016/june/minister-flanagan-launches-travelwise/">free
smartphone app called TravelWise</a> which has travel advice and consular
information on 200 countries. The app is available from the Apple and Android
stores.</p>

<h3>Repatriation of Irish people from abroad</h3>

<p>In very exceptional circumstances, where the health or security of an Irish
citizen abroad is at risk and there is no way of dealing with the situation
satisfactorily locally, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade may agree
to repatriate the person to Ireland. </p>

<p>This will be done at the sole discretion of the Department. In addition,
repatriation in this instance is subject to strict conditions which will be set
out and explained clearly in each individual case. The conditions include a
written undertaking to repay all the expenses incurred as well as a statutory
fee for this service.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are planning to move abroad, you can prepare yourself in advance by
getting as much information as possible about the country to which you are
travelling. You can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=275">search for this information
online</a> and also get information from your travel agent or the <a href="http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=376">embassy of the relevant
country</a>. You can use the library and, if possible, get in touch with people
who have lived there previously. When you arrive at your destination, you may
find that a lot of the attitudes and practices that you take for granted and
consider "normal" are in fact peculiar to Irish culture. It can take time to
settle into a new way of life. </p>

<h3>Before you leave</h3>

<p>Whether you are planning to spend time travelling abroad or are moving to
another country to work, our document on <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/travel_abroad/general_tips.html">general tips for
travelling abroad</a> outlines what you need to do before you leave. For
example, you should <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/travel_abroad/passports/applying_for_or_renewing_an_irish_passport.html">apply
for an Irish passport</a> if you donâ€™t have one already. It is important to
consider what the <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/travel_abroad/health_issues.html">health
issues</a> are. If you are going to the European Economic Area (EEA) or
Switzerland to travel or look for work you should get the <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/travel_abroad/e111.html">European Health Insurance
Card</a>. If you are travelling outside the EEA, you are strongly advised to
seek specific holiday or health insurance before you travel and you should also
check if you need to get <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/travel_abroad/vaccinations_health_tips.html">vaccinations</a>.
You can check whether you can <a href="https://www.ndls.ie/driving-abroad.html#irish-licence-holders-taking-up-residence-abroad">use
or exchange your Irish driving licence</a> when you move abroad. Before you
leave you should check our documents on <a shape="rect" href="other_useful_documents.html">useful documentation to bring </a>and <a shape="rect" href="diplomatic_supports.html">diplomatic supports for Irish
people abroad</a>.</p>

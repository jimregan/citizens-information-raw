<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Working in another country can be a very rewarding experience and a great
way of broadening your horizons and career prospects. Working outside the EU
will involve travel to new places and may offer the opportunity to try a new
career or to use and develop an existing skill or qualification. It is
important to remember from the start however, that finding a job in another
country can be time consuming and will require determination and careful
thought and planning in advance. </p>

<h3>What you need to know before you go</h3>

<p>If you have made the decision that you want to work outside the EU or if you
are being posted there through your current employment, you will have to take
into account some important issues that you may not have to consider when
working in the EU. For example, you may require a working visa or work permit
before you can commence working in your chosen country. </p>

<p>It is also useful to bear in mind other differences, such as language,
culture and climate. There may also be significant differences in work
practices, working hours and job application methods. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l2baf3">Finding out information about other
countries</h2>

<p>When you have decided on a particular country you should research the work
opportunities and possibilities and find out whether you will require a visa or
work permit. You can check all this information in advance by getting in touch
with the embassy or consulate of the country to which you will be travelling.

embassies in Ireland</a> on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

and accommodation. If you have a further or higher education qualification, you
can find out if your <a href="http://www.qqi.ie/Articles/Pages/Qualifications-Recognition.aspx">qualifications
are recognised abroad.</a> </p>

<p>Contact the <a shape="rect" href="https://www.dfa.ie/embassies/irish-embassies-abroad/">Irish embassy or
consulate</a> of the country where you will be working to find out as much as
you can in advance of travel. (This is especially important regarding regarding
entry visa and work permit requirements). Other useful sources of information

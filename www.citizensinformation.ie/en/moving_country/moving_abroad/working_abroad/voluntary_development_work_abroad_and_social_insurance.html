<p>If you are living in Ireland and have spent time working in a developing
country, you may qualify for credited social insurance contributions for the
period you spent working abroad and any preparatory period beforehand. Under
the Volunteer Development Worker (VDW) scheme these credited social insurance
contributions are called <em>VDW credits</em> and have been in place since 6
April 1983. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">Social
insurance contributions</a> entitle you to a range of benefits that are
administered by the Department of Social Protection. VDW credits are normally
fully reckonable, that is, they are treated as paid social insurance
contributions. Therefore, on your return to this country, VDW credits can help
you to qualify for certain social welfare benefits and pensions. </p>

<p>Also certain qualifying conditions for entitlement to <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/maternity_benefit.html">Maternity

(VDWs).</p>

<h3>Who is a volunteer development worker?</h3>

<p>The Department of Social Protection classifies volunteer development workers
as people working temporarily outside Ireland in a developing country on
<em>volunteer terms</em> and where their work has been arranged by or
through:</p>
<ul><li>A non-governmental agency in Ireland </li>
  <li>A governmental or non-governmental agency in any member of the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/european_government/european_union.html">European
    Union</a> </li>
  <li>Directly with the government of the developing country. </li>
</ul><p><em>Volunteer terms</em> means that the salary or wage you receive for the
work undertaken is consistent with local rates of pay in the developing
country.</p>

<p>Members of religious orders whose work involves pastoral duties are not
considered to be volunteer development workers for the purpose of this scheme.
</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>In order to qualify for VDW credits, you must be a volunteer development
worker as defined above. You must also satisfy the following conditions: </p>
<ul><li>You must be over 16 years of age </li>
  <li>You must have been resident in Ireland immediately prior to taking up the
    employment </li>
  <li>You must be employed under conditions of remuneration (pay in return for
    work) similar to the local conditions applying in the developing country
  </li>
  <li>You must have paid a minimum of 104 weeks social insurance contributions
    (PRSI) at Class A since starting work. </li>
</ul><p>If you have less than 104 Class A contributions paid Comhlámh will pay
Class A contributions for you to bring your total up to the required 104. Where
there are 2 consecutive tax years in which no contribution has been paid or
credited immediately prior to you going abroad as a volunteer development
worker, Comhlámh will pay Class A contributions for the first 26 weeks of your
assignment. (<a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/What-if-I-am-a-Public-Servant-paying-modified-Social-Insuran.aspx">Different
rules can apply to civil servants.</a>) </p>

<h3>Scheme's 5-year limit</h3>

<p>VDW credits can only be awarded for a maximum of 5 years. Different periods
of work as a volunteer development worker (VDW) are aggregated for the purpose
of calculating the 5 years. For example, if you were a VDW for 3 years
previously, and wish to go abroad as a VDW for another 3 years, you will only
qualify for VDW credits for 2 years of your second assignment. </p>

<p>Where the period of your assignment abroad exceeds 5 years, you will, where
possible, be awarded VDW credits for the period that is most beneficial to you.
</p>

<h3>Career breaks and social insurance contributions</h3>

<p>Volunteer development workers who avail of career breaks from their normal
employment in order to work abroad should contact their <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/List-of-Social-Welfare-Local-and-Branch-Offices-by-County.aspx">local
social welfare office or Intreo centre</a> if they are not re-employed
immediately after their assignment ceases. </p>
</div>
The general rule is that returned volunteer development workers are entitled to
claim Jobseeker's Benefit if the period of their career break has expired and
there is no work available from their previous employer. However, if the period
of the career break has not expired, you will <span>not be entitled</span> to
claim. <div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You can apply for credited contributions by completing <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/vol_dev1.pdf">Form VOL DEV 1 (pdf).</a>
Completed forms should be returned to your sending agency, which will in turn
forward it to Comhlámh. Ensure that you quote your correct <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">Personal
Public Service Number (PPS Number)</a> when you complete the form. </p>

<p>Comhlámh then validates the credentials of the sending agency and verifies
that you are working overseas on <em>volunteer terms</em>. </p>

<p>Following validation, Comhlámh contacts the Special Collection Section of
the Department of Social Protection and the period of your assignment is noted
by this office. </p>

<p>You can find <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Volunteer-Development-Worker-Scheme---SW-15.aspx">more

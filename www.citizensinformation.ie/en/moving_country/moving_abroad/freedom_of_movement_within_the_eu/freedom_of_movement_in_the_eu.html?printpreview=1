<p>The right to free movement is one of the basic rights of EU citizens. This
right is provided for in the Treaties governing the EU and in EU Directives and
Regulations. This document describes the general rules on free movement.
Broadly speaking, the provisions of the Treaties in relation to freedom of
movement apply in the same way to the 10 member states that joined the EU in
2004, the 2 member states (Bulgaria and Romania) that joined in January 2007
and Croatia, which joined in July 2013, although some of the rules were not put
into effect immediately under the transitional arrangements described below.
</p>

<p>The EU Treaties have a number of provisions dealing with free movement of
people and specifically with free movement of workers. The Treaties provide
that "every citizen of the Union shall have the right to move and reside freely
within the territory of the Member States subject to the limitations and
conditions laid down in the EC Treaty and by the measures adopted to give it
effect". </p>

<p>The Treaties contain a general prohibition (ban) on discrimination on the
grounds of nationality and they specifically state that freedom of movement for
workers entails "the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality
between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and
other conditions of work and employment". The Treaty provisions on free
movement of workers provide that, subject to limitations justified on grounds
of public policy, public security or public health, workers have the right to
accept offers of employment and to move freely within the territory of the
member states in order to take up such offers. </p>

<p>The main EU Directives and Regulations giving effect to the right to free
movement of workers are: </p>
<ul><li><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32011R0492:EN:NOT">Regulation
    No 492/2011</a> on freedom of movement for workers within the Union </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:158:0077:0123:EN:PDF">Directive
    2004/38/EC (pdf)</a> on the right of EU citizens and their family members
    to move and reside freely within the territory of the member states </li>
</ul><p>(Directive 2004/38/EC is implemented in Ireland by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2015/en/si/0548.html">European Communities
(Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2015</a>.)</p>

<p>There have been several cases taken to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/european_government/eu_institutions/european_court_of_justice.html">European
Court of Justice</a> which have clarified the rights of workers who move to
other member states.</p>

<h3>Rights of citizens of the new member states</h3>

<p>When new member states join the EU, the terms and conditions which apply to
them are set out in accession treaties. These treaties are then part of the
overall treaties governing the EU. Special transitional provisions on free
movement of workers were included in the Accession Treaties which apply to the
ten member states which joined in May 2004 and in the Accession Treaties with
Bulgaria and Romania. </p>

<p>These transitional provisions meant that the 15 states which were EU members
before May 2004 (the original member states) had certain rights to limit free
movement for a period. Citizens of Cyprus and Malta had complete freedom of
movement from the start of their membership (but Malta may impose restrictions
on other member states). </p>

<h3>The ten member states that joined in May 2004</h3>

<p>The following transitional arrangements applied to the other 8 new member
states that joined the EU in 2004: </p>

<p>The transitional arrangements applied to employment. They did not apply to
self-employment. This means that in general, citizens of the new member states
had the right to set up as self-employed people in the existing member states
from 1 May 2004. (There were some specific exceptions to this; none of these
applies in Ireland). Further information on <a shape="rect" href="../working_abroad/working_in_the_eu.html">working in another EU country
is available here</a>. </p>

<p>The right to free movement is subject to some general restrictions and these
apply to the citizens of the new member states in the same way as they apply to
the citizens of the existing states. </p>

<p>Citizens of the new member states are entitled to live in any of the
existing member states in order to study or as retired people. This right has
always been subject to a number of restrictions and these apply in the same way
to citizens of the new member states. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../../moving_to_ireland/rights_of_residence_in_ireland/residence_rights_eu_national.html">Further
information on residence rights of EU/EEA nationals in other EU member states
is available her</a>e. </p>
<strong>From 1 May 2004 to 1 May 2006 (first two years)</strong> <br><p>The original member states were allowed to decide whether or not to impose
restrictions on the right of free movement from the new member states. Ireland,
the UK and Sweden allowed full free movement and the other countries applied
some restrictions.</p>
<strong>From 1 May 2006 to 1 May 2009</strong> 

<p>The original member states were still allowed to maintain some restrictions
on free movement of workers. A number of countries – Finland, Greece,
Portugal and Spain lifted all restrictions and the others retained restrictions
but are gradually easing them</p>

<p><strong>From 1 May 2009<br></strong>In general, full free movement should have applied from 1 May 2009.
There was a provision however whereby an original member state could ask the
Commission to continue restrictions for a further 2 years if it was
experiencing serious disturbances in its labour market. </p>

<p>There is complete freedom of movement from 2011 for the 10 member states
that joined in 2004.</p>

<h3>Bulgaria and Romania</h3>

<p>Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU on 1 January 2007. The transitional
arrangements in relation to free movement of workers which applied to them are
as follows:</p>

<p><strong>From 1 January 2007 to 1 January 2009</strong><br>
The existing member states (including the 10 that joined in 2004) may decide to
apply restrictions on free movement. They did not have to notify the Commission
of their intention to do so. Ireland decided to impose such restrictions. This
means that citizens of Bulgaria and Romania were subject to the employment
permit requirements which applied before they joined the EU. However, those who
had been working in Ireland on a employment permit for a continuous period of
12 months or more prior to 31 December 2006 did not need a employment permit.
No new legislation was required as the Employment Permits Act 2006 gives the
Government the option of allowing full free movement or requiring employment
permits. Workers from the 2 countries had preference over people from non-EEA
member states.</p>

<p><strong>From 1 January 2009 to 1 January 2012</strong><br>
Towards the end of 2008, the Commission reviewed the operation of the free
movement rules. Member states had to notify the Commission of their intentions
in respect of free movement for the 3 years until the end of 2011 – they
could continue restrictions or could remove them. Ireland decided to continue
the restrictions until the end of 2011.</p>

<p><strong>From 1 January 2012 to 1 January 2014</strong></p>

<p>Full free movement should have applied from 2012. There is a provision
however whereby an original member state may ask the Commission to continue
restrictions for a further 2 years if it is experiencing serious disturbances
in its labour market. In December 2011 Ireland decided to maintain the current
restrictions on Bulgarians and Romanians until 31 December 2013. However on 17
July 2012 the Irish Government decided to end restrictions on Bulgarians and
Romanians accessing the Irish labour market with effect from 1 January 2012.</p>

<p>There is complete freedom of movement from 2014 for Bulgaria and Romania,
which joined in 2007.</p>

<h3>Croatia</h3>

<p>Croatia joined the EU on 1 July 2013. The transitional arrangements in
relation to free movement of workers that apply to Croatia are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>From 1 July 2013 to 1 July 2015</strong></p>

<p>EU member states could choose to restrict the right of Croatian nationals to
work in their country or in particular sectors. Ireland decided to allow full
free movement.</p>

<p><strong>From 1 July 2015</strong></p>

<p>The EU member states will be still allowed to maintain some restrictions on
the free movement of workers. This transitional arrangement should in principle
come to an end after 5 years but there is a provision whereby an original
member state can ask the Commission to continue restrictions for a further 2
years if it was experiencing serious disturbances in its labour market.</p>

<p><strong>From 1 July 2020</strong></p>

<p>There will be complete freedom of movement from 2020 for Croatia, which
joined in 2013.</p>

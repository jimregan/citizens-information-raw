<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Schengen Convention is an agreement among some European states which
allows for the abolition of systematic border controls between the
participating countries. It also includes provisions on common policy on the
temporary entry of people (including the Schengen Visa), the harmonisation of
external border controls, and cross-border police and judicial co-operation.
The name of the Convention comes from the name of the village
<span>Schengen</span> in Luxembourg where the Agreement was signed in 1985. </p>

<p>A total of 26 states have implemented the agreement so far. Border posts and
checks have been removed between Schengen area states and a common Schengen
visa (see below) allows tourist or visitor access to the area.</p>

<p>The initial 15 states that implemented the agreement are Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg,
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. The Czech Republic, Estonia,
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia implemented it
on 21 December 2007 for land and sea borders and in March 2008 for air borders.
Switzerland implemented the agreement for land borders on 12 December 2008 and
for air borders in March 2009. Liechtenstein implemented the agreement fully on
19 December 2011. Bulgaria and Romania are in the process of implementing it.
</p>

<p>Ireland and the UK have applied to take part only in the police and criminal
judicial co-operation measures and not the common border control and visa
provisions.</p>

<p>The Schengen arrangements deal with travel between the participating states.
They do not affect the rights of people to live and work in other countries.
This is covered by EU directives and regulations on <a shape="rect" href="freedom_of_movement_in_the_eu.html">free movement of people</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The Schengen countries have implemented the following arrangements:</p>
<ul><li>They have common rules about entry and short stay visas </li>
  <li>They have removed checks at their common borders and have checks only at
    the external borders; there are separate arrangements at airports for
    people travelling within the Schengen area. </li>
  <li>They have arrangements for co-ordination between the police, customs and
    the judiciary in the Schengen area states and for taking measures to combat
    terrorism and organised crime; this can include rights of hot pursuit </li>
</ul><h3>Free movement of people<br></h3>

<p>The Schengen Convention allows people who are legally present in one of the
participating countries to travel to any of the other participating countries
without having any border checks when crossing internal frontiers. </p>

<p>Internal frontiers are defined as the national boundaries between the
countries taking part in the Schengen Convention, together with airports and
seaports in the case of traffic to and from a Schengen country. Travellers may
cross the internal frontiers wherever and whenever they like without having to
undergo personal checks. However, anyone who enters or leaves the Schengen zone
is subject to the normal checks. </p>

<p>This does not mean that you can travel without identity documents. Many of
the countries concerned require their own citizens as well as others to carry
some form of ID. You may need a passport or other form of ID to establish your
entitlement to travel freely.</p>

<p>If you are legally in one participating country and you travel into another
you may move around for 3 months without any checks. After that, your right to
remain in the other country is subject to the rules in respect of taking up
residence in another country.</p>

<p>Asylum seekers in one participating country are not entitled to travel
freely to another. They are subject to the rules set out in <a shape="rect" href="../../asylum_seekers_and_refugees/the_asylum_process_in_ireland/dublin_convention.html">the
Dublin III Regulation</a> on the country to which their application for asylum
must be made.</p>

<p><strong>Schengen Borders Code:</strong> <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=en&amp;type_doc=Regulation&amp;an_doc=2006&amp;nu_doc=562">Regulation
(EC) No 562/2006</a> of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March
2006 established a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of
persons across borders.</p>

<h3>Schengen visas</h3>

<p>A <em>Schengen visa</em> is a visa issued by one of the participating
countries to third country nationals. If you have a visa to travel to one
Schengen country, you do not need a further visa to travel to the others. If
you have a valid residence permit in one Schengen country you can travel to the
others without needing a visa (in effect, a residence permit from a Schengen
country is the same as a Schengen visa). </p>

<h3>Schengen Information System<br></h3>

<p>The Schengen Information System (SIS) is a database set up to facilitate the
exchange of data on people's identities and descriptions of objects that were
either stolen or lost. It is available to the authorities in the participating
countries. It is accessible by them only to the extent that they take part in
the Schengen arrangements. </p>

<p>A new system <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR13000125">SIS
II</a> has been developed and entered into operation on 9 April 2013. Ireland
has agreed to opt in to the SIS II system. </p>

<h3>Frontex</h3>

<p>Frontex is the EU Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at
the External Borders of the Member States. It is based in Warsaw and was set up
to co-ordinate the activities of member states in the field of border security.
Responsibility for the control and surveillance of external borders lies with
the member states. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu">Frontex</a> was established by Regulation
(EC) 2007/2004. Ireland and the UK are not involved.</p>

<h3>Legal status of Schengen <br></h3>

<p>The original Schengen Convention (agreed in 1985) was an international
agreement between the countries who agreed to be bound by it. A further
convention was agreed in 1990. The Convention came into effect in 1995. In
1998, the conventions became part of EU law when the Treaty of Amsterdam came
into effect. </p>

<h3>Ireland and Schengen</h3>

<p>Ireland is not part of the Schengen arrangements on travel and visas. It is
open to Ireland to take part in these arrangements if all of the Schengen
members and a representative of the Irish government vote unanimously in favour
within the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/european_government/eu_institutions/council_of_the_european_union.html">Council
of the EU</a>. This means that Irish people are subject to passport checks at
the borders of other EU member states.</p>

<h3>The External Borders Fund <br></h3>

<p>The External Borders Fund aims to help with the creation of an efficient,
high and uniform level of control at the external borders. Ireland is not
involved.</p>

<h3>The Prüm Treaty<br></h3>

<p>The Prüm Treaty is sometimes referred to as <em>Schengen Plus. </em>It was
signed on 27 May 2005 by 7 countries - France, Germany, Spain, Austria,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg. They agreed to increase their
co-operation in order fight against terrorism, cross border crime and illegal
migration. The agreement allows for the exchange of data on finger prints and
genetic information. The agreement is open to other Schengen member states.
This is an international agreement between the countries concerned. It has no
connection at present with EU law.</p>

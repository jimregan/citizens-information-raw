<p>A common travel area is in existence between Ireland and the UK (including
the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man). The Common Travel Area has been in
operation since the 1920s but is not specifically provided for in legislation.
The first legal recognition of the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the
United Kingdom (UK) is contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam. The Irish
Government and the UK government have agreed reciprocal visa arrangements;
measures to increase the security of the external Common Travel Area border;
and to share immigration data between the two countriesâ€™ immigration
authorities.</p>

<p>The Common Travel Area means that there are no passport controls in
operation for Irish and UK citizens travelling between the 2 countries. You do
not need to have a passport in order to enter the other country. However, all
air and sea carriers require some form of identification and some regard a
passport as the only valid identification. Immigration authorities may also
require you to have valid official photo-identification which shows your
nationality. As you are being asked to prove that you are an Irish or UK
citizen who is entitled to avail of the Common Travel Area arrangements, it is
advisable to travel with your passport.</p>

<p>The Common Travel Area also involves some co-operation on matters relating
to immigration issues. A third country national, for example, may be refused
permission to enter Ireland if it is their intention to travel onwards to the
UK and they would not qualify for admission to the UK under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1975/en/si/0128.html">Aliens (Amendment)
Order 1975</a>. Irish immigration officers have the power to carry out checks
on people arriving in the State from the UK and to refuse them entry to the
State on the same grounds as apply to people arriving from outside the Common
Travel Area. These checks are carried out selectively. </p>

<p>In December 2011, the Irish and UK governments agreed <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/IRELAND-UK%20ACCORD%20TO%20FURTHER%20SECURE%20THE%20COMMON%20TRAVEL%20AREA">measures
to secure the external Common Travel Area border</a>. This includes exchanging
biographic and biometric visa data and co-operating on establishing information
about failed asylum seekers. There is a joint UK-Ireland Common Travel Area
Forum which implements these measures.</p>

<h3>People with UK visas or residence permits</h3>

<p>If you are a citizen of a country whose nationals need a visa to enter
Ireland and you have a valid UK visa or residence permit, you may be required
to have a valid visa before you arrive in Ireland. The <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Irish%20Short%20Stay%20Visa%20Waiver%20Programme">Short
Stay Visa Waiver Programme</a> allows nationals of a number of Eastern
European, Middle East and Asian countries who have a short-term UK visa to come
to Ireland without the need for a separate Irish visa. This programme has been
extended to 31 October 2021.</p>

<p><strong>Reciprocal visa arrangements:</strong> A <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/British%20Irish%20Visa%20Scheme">British
Irish Visa Scheme</a> applies to visitors from China since 20 October 2014 and
to visitors from India since 9 February 2015. This scheme allows visitors from
these countries to travel freely within the Common Travel Area (in this case,
Ireland and the UK but not the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man), using
either an Irish or UK visa.</p>

<p>Both schemes are provided for in the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/si/0473.html">Immigration Act
(Visas) Order 2014 (SI 473/2014)</a> as amended by <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/si/502/made/en/pdf">SI 502/2016
(pdf)</a>. </p>

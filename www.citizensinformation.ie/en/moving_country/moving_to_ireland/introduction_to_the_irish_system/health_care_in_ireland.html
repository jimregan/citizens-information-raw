<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Public health care for people coming to Ireland</h3>

<p>If you are a national of the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/eu-eea-countries">European Economic
Area (EEA)</a> or Switzerland, or if you are normally resident in Ireland, you
are entitled to receive the same level of health care as Irish citizens.
Depending on your income, you may be eligible for a <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical
card</a>, which entitles you to the full range of medical services at no cost.
</p>

<p>If you are not from an EEA member state or Switzerland, you will be entitled
to certain services free of charge and you will have to pay for the remainder.
</p>

<p>If you are coming to live, work, study or retire in Ireland you can find out
<a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/entitlement_to_public_health_services.html">more
information on eligibility for public health services</a>. If you are coming to
Ireland on holiday or on a short stay (for example, on business), you can read
<a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/health_services_and_visitors_to_ireland.html">more
information on health services for visitors to Ireland.</a> </p>

<h3>Private health care for people coming to Ireland</h3>

<p>In addition to the public health system, people in Ireland can avail of a
range of private health care services. You must pay the full costs of treatment
if you opt for private health care. </p>

<p>There are a number of <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/health_insurance/private_health_insurance.html">private health
insurance</a> companies in Ireland. Providers include <a href="https://www.vhi.ie/">VHI Healthcare</a>, <a href="https://www.layahealthcare.ie/">Laya Healthcare</a>, <a href="http://www.irishlifehealth.ie/">Irish Life Health</a><a shape="rect" href="http://www.hibernian.ie/online/health/"></a>and <a href="http://www.hsf.ie/">HSF Health Plan</a> (does not provide cover for
hospital in-patient costs). As long as you are from the EEA or Switzerland or
normally resident in Ireland, you are entitled to the same benefits from your
private health insurance with any of these companies as any other Irish
citizen. </p>

<p>Since 16 October 2013, up to €1,000 for adults and €500 for children of
your private health insurance premium attracts <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/taxation_and_medical_expenses.html">tax
relief</a> at the standard rate (20%). This tax relief is deducted at source by
the health insurance provider.</p>

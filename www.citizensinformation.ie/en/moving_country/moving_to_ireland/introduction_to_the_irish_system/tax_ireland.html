<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are coming to live in Ireland, depending on your personal
circumstances, there are different taxes which you may have to pay. The <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/index.html">Revenue Commissioners, also known as
Revenue</a>, are the government body who assess and collect taxes and duties in
Ireland. You need to have a <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">Personal
Public Service Number (PPS number)</a> when taking up employment or
self-employment.</p>

<p>Employees and self-employed people aged under 66 pay <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social
insurance (PRSI) contributions</a> in addition to taxes.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l3df2f">Tax on income</h2>

<p>Nearly all income is liable to tax. The first part of your income, up to a
certain amount, is taxed at the <em>standard rate of tax</em>. The remainder of
your income is taxed at the <em>higher rate of tax</em>. You can read more in
our document on <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/how_your_tax_is_calculated.html">how
your income tax is calculated</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Employees</strong> have income tax deducted from their pay under the
Pay As You Earn (PAYE) system by their employer. You can read more in our
document on <a href="../../../employment/starting_work_and_changing_job/starting_work/tax_and_starting_work.html">tax
and starting work</a>. Employees who have income from other sources <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/how_to_comply_with_your_tax_obligations.html">must
pay tax on this</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Self-employed</strong> people pay income tax under the
self-assessment system on the profits from their business and on any other
income that they have. Read more in our document on <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/taxation_of_self_employed_people.html">tax
and self-employed people</a>.</p>

<h3>Reducing your tax</h3>

<p>Tax credits and reliefs reduce the amount of tax you have to pay. Tax is
calculated as a percentage of your income. Your tax credits are deducted from
this to give the amount of tax that you have to pay, for example, your personal
tax credit. In some cases you can get relief for specific expenses, for
example, medical expenses. You can read more in our document on <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/introduction_to_income_tax_credits_and_reliefs.html">tax
credits and reliefs</a>.</p>

<h3>Universal Social Charge</h3>

<p>The Universal Social Charge (USC) is a tax on your income that is charged on
your gross income before any <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/">pension</a> or PRSI
contributions are deducted. Find out more in our document on the <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">Universal
Social Charge</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l03d31">Other taxes</h2>

<p>You may have to pay <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/capital_taxes/capital_acquisitions_tax.html">Capital
Acquisitions Tax</a> on any gift or inheritances that you receive. If you own a
residential property in Ireland you are liable for payment of <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/housing_taxes_and_reliefs/local_property_tax.html">Local
Property Tax</a>. If you earn interest on savings then you pay a tax on the
interest called <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/tax_on_savings_and_investments/deposit_interest_retention_tax.html">Deposit
Interest Retention Tax (DIRT)</a>.</p>

<p>In general, if you <a href="../../../travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/buying_or_selling_a_vehicle/buying_a_new_car.html">buy
a new car</a> or if you <a href="../coming_to_live_in_ireland/importing_car_into_ireland.html">import a
car into Ireland</a>, it is liable for Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) and must
be registered with Revenue. You must also pay <a href="../../../travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/motor_tax_and_insurance/motor_tax_rates.html">motor
tax</a> if you want to drive your vehicle in a public place.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l6804f">Residence</h2>

<p>Your liability for tax in Ireland can be affected by whether you are
resident in the country and whether Ireland is your permanent home. Generally
you will be charged Irish tax on your world-wide income earned or arising in a
tax year during which you are resident, ordinarily resident or domiciled in
Ireland for tax purposes. You can read more in our document on <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/moving_country_and_taxation/tax_residence_and_domicile_in_ireland.html">tax
residence and domicile</a>.</p>

<p>As a particular item of income can be taxable in both the country where it
is sourced and also in the country in which you, as the recipient, are
resident, Ireland has a number of double taxation agreements with other
countries in order to avoid double taxation. Find out more in our document on

to live in Ireland and tax</a>.</p>

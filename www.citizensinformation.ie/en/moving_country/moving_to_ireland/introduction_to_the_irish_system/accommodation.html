<p>You should arrange accommodation before you arrive in Ireland, even for the
first few days of your stay. Organise in advance to stay with friends or book
yourself in to a hotel or a hostel in order to give yourself time to look
around and get to grips with the accommodation situation in the area in which
you plan to live.</p>

<h3>Buying a house</h3>

<p>If you are thinking of <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/owning_a_home/buying_a_home/">buying a house,</a> you need to be
aware of the price trends in this country, the process by which houses are
bought and sold and the initial costs that are involved. </p>

<h3>Renting accommodation</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/renting_a_home/">Rented accommodation</a>
comes in many forms. You can choose from houses, flats, apartments,
house-shares and bed-sits, according to what suits your needs and your budget.
You will need to know how these are advertised and rented and what your <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/renting_a_home/tenants_rights_and_obligations.html">rights and
responsibilities are as a tenant</a>.</p>

<h3>Social housing</h3>

<p>Local authorities are the main providers of <a href="../../../housing/local_authority_and_social_housing/applying_for_local_authority_housing.html">social
housing</a> for people who cannot afford to buy their own homes. Non-Irish
nationals must have a legal right to remain in the State on a long-term basis
to be eligible to apply for social housing. Detailed rules are contained in <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad,29412,en.pdf">Circular
Housing 41/2012 Access to social housing supports for non-Irish nationals
(pdf)</a>.</p>

<h2>Information</h2>

<p>Ireland has a local government system. <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/local_and_regional_government/local_authorities.html">Local
authorities</a> include county councils and city councils. Since 1 June 2014,
borough and town councils are replaced by a system of municipal districts,
integrating town and county governance. At county or city level, there are 31
city and county councils with integrated municipal districts. These are the
main providers of local government services around the country.</p>

<p>Local authorities at all levels are responsible for the representation of
local communities and ensuring that concerns are expressed and needs met. <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/elections_and_referenda/local_elections/local_elections.html">Local
elections</a> are held in order to elect representatives onto the authority. <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/local_and_regional_government/councillors.html">Local
representatives</a> have the power to vote for or against developments that
will impact on the local community.</p>

<p>Local authorities are also responsible for the delivery of a wide range of
services in their local area. These services generally include: </p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/local_authority_and_social_housing/applying_for_local_authority_housing.html">Housing</a>
  </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/planning_permission/planning_permission_general.html">Planning</a>
  </li>
  <li>Roads </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/environment/water_services/water_supply.html">Water supply</a> and

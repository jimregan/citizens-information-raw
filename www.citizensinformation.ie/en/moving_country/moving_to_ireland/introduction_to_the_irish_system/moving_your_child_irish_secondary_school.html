<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Irish secondary (also known as post-primary) school cycle is generally 5
or 6 years long. Children begin their secondary school studies around the age
of 12 and leave around the age of 17 or 18, having taken 2 State exams in that
period. The minimum school leaving age is 16 years or the completion of 3 years
of post-primary education, whichever is the later. </p>

<p>Most schools offer students the option of a <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_post_primary_school/transition_year.html">Transition
Year</a> after they have completed the first 3 years of secondary education.
This allows students to explore non-academic interests, whether they are
social, creative or linked to the world of business. At the end of the first 3
years students sit the <a href="../../../education/state_examinations/junior_certificate_programme.html">Junior
Certificate</a> examination and after that they may choose from 3 different
Leaving Certificate programmes. They can take the <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/state_examinations/established_leaving_certificate.html">traditional
(established) Leaving Certificate</a> or they can choose from the <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/state_examinations/leaving_certificate_vocational_programme.html">Leaving
Certificate Vocational Programme </a>or the <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/state_examinations/leaving_certificate_applied.html">Leaving
Certificate Applied Programme</a>, both of which focus on a student's more
practical and technical abilities. </p>

<p>More information on secondary education is in our document, <a href="../../../education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_post_primary_school/post_primary_education_life_event.html">Starting

<h3>The school year</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/attendance_and_discipline_in_schools/school_terms_in_primary_and_postprimary.html">Irish
secondary school year</a> stretches from the first week in September to the
first week in June. If your child is going into a Junior Certificate Class or a
Leaving Certificate class, however, they will not finish until later in June,
as they will be taking their exams at that time. </p>

<h3>The types of schools available</h3>

<p>The post-primary school system includes secondary schools, vocational
schools, community or comprehensive schools and fee-paying secondary schools.
The majority of Irish children go to secondary schools, which are privately
owned and managed and often run by religious orders, although the teachers in
these schools are generally lay staff. The majority of secondary schools are
free, but there are also fee-paying schools. </p>

<p>Vocational schools and community or comprehensive schools are all free.
These schools tend to provide both academic and technical education and they
often provide additional further education opportunities for school-leavers and
adults in the local community. </p>

<p>There are a small number of private international schools in Ireland
including a French school, a Japanese school and a German school. </p>

<h3>Choosing a school and enrolling your child</h3>

<p>You can get a <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/find-a-school">list of
Irish schools</a> on a county-by-county basis from the Department of Education
and Skills. </p>

<p>You should gather as much information as possible about the schools in which
you are interested. Schools can vary quite considerably in the ways in which
they operate and the emphasis they put on areas such as exams, sports, the
arts, personal development, religion, social affairs, European languages and
practical skills acquisition. </p>

<p>Talk to teachers and, if possible, to other parents in order to see whether
the school is likely to meet the needs of your particular child.</p>

<p>Some schools will have a waiting list. You will need to investigate the
enrolment policy of the school in which you are interested and in general you
should plan the enrolment of your child well in advance.</p>

<p>If you are planning to remain abroad and to send your child to an Irish
school as an overseas student, you can choose from a range of fee-paying
secondary schools (such as a boarding school or a day secondary school) that
arrange accommodation and guardianship, as appropriate.</p>

<h3>The points system</h3>

<p>If your child wishes to go to university or another third-level institution,
they will need to score enough points in their Leaving Certificate exams. They
will receive points for the 6 best grades they receive with the highest points
going to an A1 in a paper at Honours level. Most students take 7 subjects in
the Leaving Certificate.</p>

<p>The points they need for third-level courses will depend on the subject they
wish to study. More information on going to third-level education is in our
document, <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/third_level_education/applying_to_college/application_procedures_and_entry_requirements.html">Application
procedures and entry requirements</a>. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Education in State-funded second-level schools is free.</p>

<p>The costs of fee-paying secondary schools can vary considerably. You will
need to check with each individual school.</p>

<p>Whatever school you choose, you will need to pay for school books and, where
appropriate, school uniforms. Usually, you will also have to pay for
extra-curricular activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>Apply directly to the school in which you are interested, as early as
possible and ask about their enrolment policy. Some schools may ask your child
to sit an entrance exam, for which they will charge a fee.</p>

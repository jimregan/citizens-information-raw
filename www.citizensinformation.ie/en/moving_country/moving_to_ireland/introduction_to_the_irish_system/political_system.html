<p>The <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Constitution</a>
is the fundamental legal document that sets down how Ireland should be
governed. It establishes the Head of State, branches of government, the courts
and it also sets out how those institutions should be run. The Constitution has
another important function; it describes the fundamental rights that every
Irish citizen is entitled to. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l50aaf">The Oireachtas (the Irish Parliament)</h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/dail_eireann.html">Dáil</a>
and <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/the_seanad.html">Seanad</a>
(Senate) are collectively known as the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Government
is chosen by and is collectively responsible to the Dáil. There must be a
minimum of 7 and a maximum of 15 <a href="../../../government_in_ireland/national_government/the_irish_government/composition_of_the_government.html">Ministers</a>.
The <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/the_irish_government/the_taoiseach.html">Taoiseach</a>,
the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/the_irish_government/the_tanaiste.html">Tanaiste</a>
and the Minister for Finance must be members of the Dáil. It is possible to
have 2 Ministers who are members of the Senate but this rarely happens. </p>

<p>The Government's main functions are to propose legislation, manage the
public finances and <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/government_departments/administration_of_government_departments.html">administer
the government departments</a>.</p>

<p>The Government is responsible to the Dáil. It is not responsible to the
Senate. However, Ministers have a right to attend the Senate and it is normal
practice for the relevant Minister or Minister of State to be present when the
House is dealing with their areas of responsibility.</p>

<h3>Committees</h3>

<p>Much of the work of the Dáil and Senate is now done in Committees. Each
House may form Committees for particular purposes. Select Committees have the
power to take oral and written evidence and seek documents. Joint Committees
are Select Committees of each House sitting and voting together. Special
Committees do not have the same powers as Select Committees.</p>

<p>In general, Committees deal with Estimates of Expenditure, Committee Stages
of Bills relevant to their terms of reference and related reports. It is common
for Committees to invite voluntary and community organisations and/ or experts
to make submissions to them on various issues and it is also common for such
organisations to ask to make a submission.</p>

<h3>Controlling the public finances </h3>

<p>Each year, the Government prepares the Estimates of the Receipts and
Expenditure of the State. This is an outline of the costs of running each
Department and Office of State. The Estimates are published before the annual
Budget. The Dáil and the relevant Committees debate the Estimates in detail.
The Estimates are passed by the Dáil and are given statutory effect by the
Appropriation Act. The Budget is given immediate legal effect by financial
resolutions of the Dáil on the evening of the Budget speech. The Finance Act
must be passed within 4 months of the Budget.</p>

<p>At present, budgeting is on an annual basis. Proposals for multi-annual
budgets are being considered. You can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.budget.gov.ie/">view the full text of Ireland's Budget
here</a>.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/comptroller_and_auditor_general.html">Comptroller
and Auditor General</a> is appointed under <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">the
Constitution</a> to control on behalf of the State all disbursements and to
audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the
Oireachtas. The Comptroller's functions are set out in legislation.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l46f43">Legislation</h2>

<p>It is almost always the Government of the day that propose new laws. A
Minister presents a <em>Bill</em> to the Dáil or Seanad for discussion and
decision. A <em>Bill</em> is proposed legislation - after it is passed and
signed by the President, it is called an <em>Act.</em> Occasionally, a TD or
Senator presents what is called a Private Member's Bill. It is very rare for
such a Bill to get beyond the first stage - the reasons for this are political
rather than legal. However, some important legislation in recent years has
resulted from Private Members' Bills - notably The Judicial Separation and
Family Law Reform Act 1989. The procedure is the same whether the Bill is
proposed by the Government or by a Member.</p>

<p>Usually, a Bill is presented by a Minister to the Dáil. Occasionally the
process is started in the Seanad but any Bills dealing with taxation or related
matters must start in the Dáil. Each Bill has to go through a number of
<em>stages</em> or <em>readings</em>. It can be defeated at any of these stages
and, if this happens in the Dáil, the process ends there. The Seanad can only
obstruct a Bill. In practice, Government Bills are not often defeated. You can
view <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/">all Irish legislation 1922 to
date here</a>.</p>

<h3>The stages</h3>

<p>The first stage or reading just involves presenting the title of the Bill to
the Dáil (or Seanad). In effect, that just allows the Bill to be printed. The
Bill is then circulated to all TDs (or Senators) and there is a second reading.
At this second stage the Minister who is presenting the Bill explains what it
is all about. The next stage is called the Committee stage. The Bill is
analysed in detail at this stage and amendments may be put down either by the
Government or the Opposition. The fourth stage - sometimes called the report
stage - involves an overall discussion and again, amendments may be put down
and voted upon. The next stage involves sending the Bill to the other House
(the Seanad usually) where a similar procedure is followed.</p>

<p>The Seanad cannot amend or defeat a money Bill. It can amend and delay other
Bills.</p>

<p>When the Bill is passed by both the Dáil and Seanad it is sent to the
President for signature. The Bill is now an Act. It may become law immediately
after the President signs or there may be a clause or clauses in it which
specify when it will come into effect. </p>

<h3>Subordinate legislation</h3>

<p>Subordinate legislation is a lesser form of legislation than Acts. The most
common is a Statutory Instrument (SI). There must be specific power laid down
in an Act in order to allow a Statutory Instrument to be effective. Usually an
Act authorises a Minister to make Regulations dealing with details. The Act
itself sets out the general law. The Statutory Instrument cannot deviate in any
way from what is laid down in the Act - if they do, they are what is called
<em>ultra vires</em>. That means "beyond the powers" - that is, the Minister
does not have the power to do what he is purporting to do.</p>

<p>Statutory Instruments do not usually have to be passed by the Oireachtas.
Apart from Ministers, certain other bodies, mainly regulatory bodies, have the
power to make subordinate legislation, for example, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.comreg.ie">Commission for Telecommunications Regulation
(ComReg)</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.lawsociety.ie">Incorporated Law Society</a>.</p>

<h3>The role of Ministers</h3>

<p>Under the Constitution, Departments of State are administered by members of
the Government (Ministers) and the Minister is in charge of the Department.
This means that final responsibility rests with the Minister but many of the
functions of the Department and responsibility for various actions are assigned
to <a href="../../../government_in_ireland/government_departments/the_civil_service.html">civil
servants</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l9ac4f">Policy making</h2>

<h3>Green Papers, White Papers and discussion documents </h3>

<p>A Green Paper is a discussion document, usually written by civil servants,
in which an issue is outlined, various options are suggested and the advantages
and disadvantages of those options may be set out. Generally, the public is
asked for submissions on the options proposed. After this process is complete,
a White Paper is drawn up - this sets out the Government's policy on the issue
and what it intends to do. The proposals in the White Paper are then
implemented.</p>

<p>Sometimes this process occurs but the titles Green and White Papers are not
used; they are called discussion documents or something similar. Sometimes a
White Paper is published without a preceding Green Paper. Sometimes the process
is carried through and then nothing happens after the White Paper is published.
Sometimes papers are published which have the same effect as a White Paper but
are called strategy documents or similar. The actual public consultation
process varies as well.</p>

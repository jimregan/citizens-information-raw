<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are thinking of coming to Ireland to live, work, study or retire, it
is important for you to be aware of the <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_welfare_system_in_ireland.html">social
security system in Ireland</a>. There may be some significant differences
between the system in Ireland and your home country so it will be worthwhile to
familiarise yourself with the system in advance. </p>

<h3>EU Regulations and Bilateral Social Security Agreements</h3>

<p>If you have come from a country covered by EU Regulations or Bilateral
Social Security Agreements, your pension rights from the other country are
protected when you move to Ireland. You may be able to <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/social_insurance_contributions_from_abroad.html">combine
your insurance records from Ireland and another country in order to qualify for
a pension or social insurance payment</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Applying for a UK or other EEA pension:</strong> if you are resident
in Ireland but you have never worked in Ireland you can apply for your
contributory pension either to the country where you last worked, for example,
the UK, or to the Department of Social Protection - see 'How to apply' below.
</p>

<h3>Transferring UK benefits</h3>

<p>Many UK benefits including national insurance pensions can continue to be
paid to you by the UK Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) if you move from
the UK to Ireland. You should always ask in advance if you can transfer your
existing UK benefits outside the UK by contacting the DWP's International
Pension Centre - see 'Where to apply' below.</p>

<h3>Social assistance payments</h3>

<p>If you do not have enough social insurance contributions from another
country and/or Ireland, you may qualify for an assistance-based payment that is
relevant to your circumstances. Assistance-based payments do not relate to your
social insurance record. Instead, the Department of Social Protection (which is
responsible for the administration of the social security system in Ireland)
examines all your sources of income. If your income is below a certain amount,
you may qualify for a payment appropriate to your needs. <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">There
are also residency requirements for social assistance payments in Ireland</a>.

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you are coming from a country covered by EU Regulations (an EU/EEA
country), you should bring forms U1 (formerly E301) and E104 with you. These
forms are available at the relevant social security agency in the country you
are coming from and provide details of your social insurance record. </p>

<p>When you come to Ireland, you will need a <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">Personal
Public Service Number (PPS number).</a> This number is a unique personal
identification number that is essential for applying for State benefits and
services in Ireland. You can find out about <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/">claiming
a Irish social welfare payment.</a></p>

<p><strong>Applying for a UK or other EEA pension</strong></p>

<p>If you are resident in Ireland but you have never worked in Ireland you can
apply for your contributory pension in Ireland or to the country where you last
worked and paid social insurance.</p>

<p><strong>If you are applying in Ireland</strong> you must complete the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/eup65.pdf">application form EUP 65 (pdf)</a>
and send it with the relevant documents such as birth and marriage certificates
to the State Pension Contributory Section of the Department of Social
Protection - see 'Where to apply' below. Your application will be then sent to
the International Pension Centre in the UK or to the appropriate EEA
authority.</p>

<p><strong>If you are applying to the UK</strong> for your UK State pension and
you have not been sent an application form, you should contact the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/international-pension-centre">International Pension
Centre</a> - see 'Where to apply' below.</p>

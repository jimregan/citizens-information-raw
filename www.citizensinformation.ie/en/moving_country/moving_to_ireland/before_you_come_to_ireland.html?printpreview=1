<p>There are many reasons why you may be coming to Ireland. You may be coming
to work, to set up a business, to study, to join a family member or to retire.
You may be looking for international protection and intend to apply for refugee
status or subsidiary protection. Before you come to Ireland, you need to know
first of all whether or not you are entitled to live here. Your right to live
in Ireland depends mainly on your nationality and what you intend to do when
you come here. </p>

<p>After you have established whether or not you are entitled to come and live
in Ireland, you will need other information about the formalities of living
here. This document is an overview of the main things you need to know if you
are proposing to come to Ireland to live. (It is not designed for short term
visitors, but you may find some relevant information below.)</p>

<h3>Coming to Ireland and permission to enter</h3>

<p>There are some general rules which apply regardless of the reason why you
are coming to Ireland.</p>

<p><strong>UK nationals</strong>: People who are citizens of the United Kingdom
(UK) are entitled to live in Ireland without any conditions or restrictions.
You can read more in our document, <a href="rights_of_residence_in_ireland/residence_rules_UK_citizens.html">Residence
rights of UK nationals</a>.</p>

<p><strong>EEA and Switzerland:</strong> In general, <a shape="rect" href="rights_of_residence_in_ireland/residence_rights_eu_national.html">nationals
of EEA countries or Switzerland,</a> have the right to enter Ireland (subject
to some narrow restrictions). You do not need a visa but you will need a valid
passport or identity card in order to land. You are generally entitled to take
up residence in Ireland if you are employed or self-employed. You are entitled
to come here to study or retire here if you meet certain conditions. </p>

<p><strong>Other countries: </strong>Nationals of other countries need <a shape="rect" href="coming_to_live_in_ireland/permission_to_land_in_ireland.html">permission
to enter in Ireland</a> and require <a shape="rect" href="rights_of_residence_in_ireland/residence_rights_of_non_eea_nationals_in_ireland.html">permission
to remain here</a>. (This doesn't apply if you are a family member of an EEA or
a Swiss national who is exercising the right of free movement. You must however
get a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP07000025">residence card.)</a> </p>

<h3>Coming to Ireland to work <br></h3>

<p>Your right to work as an employee, to be self-employed or set up a business
in Ireland depends on your nationality and a number of other factors. You can
<a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/migrant_workers/finding_a_job_when_you_move_to_ireland.html">find
out about jobs in Ireland</a> from a number of sources. If you are <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/migrant_workers/coming_to_ie_tax.html">starting
work</a> you will need information on issues such as tax and social insurance
contributions. </p>

<p><strong>EEA and Swiss nationals</strong> have the right to live, work or set
up a business in Ireland. You do not need an employment permit. You are
entitled to be treated in the same way as Irish workers. You are entitled to
have family members come with you to Ireland. </p>

<p><strong>Other countries: </strong>If you are from outside the EEA or
Switzerland you may <a shape="rect" href="coming_to_live_in_ireland/visa_requirements_for_entering_ireland.html">need
a visa</a> in order to come here. You need an <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/">employment permit</a> in
order to work or permission to <a href="../../employment/types_of_employment/self_employment/coming_to_set_up_a_business_in_ireland.html">set
up a business here</a>. You can find out about the different types of
employment permit if <a shape="rect" href="working_in_ireland/coming_to_work_in_ireland.html">you are coming to work
in Ireland</a>. Your entitlement to have family members come to join you in
Ireland depends on the type of employment permit you have. </p>

<h3>Coming to Ireland to study </h3>

<p>If you intend to come to Ireland to study, you must get a place in an Irish
educational institution. <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/the_irish_education_system/overview_of_the_irish_education_system.html">There
is further information on the education system at primary, secondary and third
level</a>. If you are <a shape="rect" href="studying_in_ireland/third_level_education.html">moving to Ireland for
third-level education</a> you can find out about the allocation of third-level
places. </p>

<p>You can read more about <a href="studying_in_ireland/immigration_nonEEA_students.html">immigrations
rules for full-time non-EEA students</a>. </p>

<p>In general, universities and other third-level colleges charge higher fees
to students from outside the EEA and Switzerland. </p>

<p>Seeking protection generally means <a shape="rect" href="../asylum_seekers_and_refugees/the_asylum_process_in_ireland/applying_for_refugee_status_in_ireland.html">applying
for refugee status or subsidiary protection</a> but, if you are refused this,
you may apply for <a shape="rect" href="../asylum_seekers_and_refugees/refugee_status_and_leave_to_remain/leave_to_remain.html">permission
to remain.</a> EEA nationals are not entitled to seek protection in Ireland. If
you are seeking protection you must be allowed to land in Ireland. You can find
out more about the <a shape="rect" href="../asylum_seekers_and_refugees/the_asylum_process_in_ireland/">asylum
process</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="../asylum_seekers_and_refugees/services_for_asylum_seekers_in_ireland/">services
available to asylum seekers.</a> </p>

<p>You may be a <a shape="rect" href="../asylum_seekers_and_refugees/refugee_status_and_leave_to_remain/rights_of_convention_programme_refugees_people_given_leave_to_remain.html">Programme
refugee</a>. This means that you come to Ireland as part of an organised group
and have refugee status. You do not have to go through the normal applications

<p><strong>Tax and social insurance contributions:</strong> If you are working
or self-employed you are obliged to pay <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">PRSI
contributions</a> in the same way as Irish people. If you are resident in
Ireland, you may be liable for <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/">income tax</a> and for <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/capital_taxes/">capital taxes.</a> There are specific

<p><strong>Social security entitlements:</strong> If you are moving to Ireland
you need to know about your social security entitlements. EEA and Swiss
nationals come under the general rules on <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Social-Insurance-and-EC-Regulations.aspx">social
security for migrant workers</a>. This means that you may receive certain
benefits from your home country while you are in Ireland and you may combine
social insurance contributions paid in 2 or more countries to help you qualify
for benefits. You are also entitled to the same social and tax advantages as
Irish citizens.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Bilateral-Social-Security-Agreements-with-Other-Countries.aspx">bilateral
social security arrangements</a> with a small number of other countries. These
generally allow contributions in the other countries to be combined with your
Irish contributions to enable you to qualify for benefits.</p>

<p><strong>Social assistance payments:</strong> Everyone, including Irish
citizens, has to meet the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitual
residence requirement</a> if applying for a social assistance payment. </p>

<p><strong>Changing your name:</strong> A foreign national aged 18 or over must
get a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP07000033">change of name
licence</a> from the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/">Irish
Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS)</a> before executing a <a href="../../birth_family_relationships/problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/changing_your_name_by_deed_poll.html">deed
poll.</a> A British citizen does not require a change of name licence but is
likely to need a letter to that effect from INIS. </p>

<p><strong>Pets:</strong> There are regulations about importing pets from
abroad, so you need find out about the <a shape="rect" href="coming_to_live_in_ireland/bringing_pets_to_ireland.html">procedures for
bringing your pet to Ireland.</a> </p>

<p><strong>Customs:</strong> There are <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/travel_to_ireland/customs_regulations_for_travellers.html">customs
regulations about the importation of prohibited or restricted goods</a> and <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/travel_to_ireland/examination_of_travellers_baggage_by_customs_and_excise_officers.html">Customs
and Excise officers have the power to carry out searches of the baggage of
people travelling to Ireland</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Driving, cars and transport:</strong> Full driving licences from all
other EU member states (and some other countries) are recognised for use in
Ireland. You should find out if you need to <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/driver_licensing/exchanging_foreign_driving_permit.html">convert
your driving licence to an Irish one</a>. If you want to bring your car to
Ireland you need to know about <a shape="rect" href="coming_to_live_in_ireland/importing_car_into_ireland.html">importing a
car</a> and implications for Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT).</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The importation of pets into Ireland has always been strictly controlled to
ensure that diseases such as rabies are not introduced. The EU system of
Passports for Pets allows cats, dogs and ferrets to travel between EU member
states. Pets from higher risk non-EU countries will also require a blood test -
see 'Non-qualifying high-risk countries' below.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lc8a2c">Cats, dogs and ferrets</h2>

<p>If you are coming on holiday or to move to Ireland or other non-commercial
movement where there is no sale or change of ownership, you may bring your cat,
dog or ferret with you. Since 28 December 2014, under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/si/0602.html">Pet Passport (No. 2)
Regulations</a> there are changes to the rules governing the non-commercial
movement of cats, dogs and ferrets.</p>

<h3>Pets from EU member states</h3>

<p>If you want to import a cat, dog or ferret into Ireland from any <a href="http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/media/migration/animalhealthwelfare/eupetpassport/qualifyingcountriesandterritories/ListEUMemberStatesEuropeanCountries2015210115.doc">EU
member state including the UK</a>, the pet animal must have an <a href="http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/pets/getapetpassport/"><span>EU Pet
Passport</span></a>, (this document is the same throughout the EU). </p>

<p>The Passport certifies that:</p>
<ul><li>The pet is travelling from an eligible country. </li>
  <li>The pet is identified by an implanted microchip. </li>
  <li>The pet has been vaccinated against rabies subsequently at least 21 days
    before travel</li>
  <li>Dogs coming from countries other than the UK, Finland or Malta have been
    treated against tapeworm between 24 and 120 hours before travel. The time
    and date of treatment are entered on the passport. Treatment for ticks is
    not compulsory but it is advisable to get it at the same time as the
    tapeworm treatment. </li>
</ul><p>If there are more than 5 animals, a veterinary health certificate showing
that animals have been clinically examined within 48 hours of departure is also
required unless the owner can show proof that the animals are being brought to
compete in a sporting event or other competition.</p>

<h3>Pets from outside the EU</h3>

<p>If you want to import a cat, dog or ferret into Ireland from a country
outside the EU there are 2 categories of these countries: qualifying lower-risk
countries and non-qualifying high-risk countries. You can check if your country
of origin is on this <a href="http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/pets/qualifyingcountriesterritories/listofqualifyinglowerriskcountries/">list
of qualifying lower-risk countries</a>. If it is not on this list then your
country of origin is a non-qualifying high-risk country. </p>

<p><strong>Pets from qualifying non-EU countries</strong></p>

<p>A cat, dog or ferret from a qualifying lower-risk non-EU country must
undergo the following in this order:</p>
<ul><li>Be identified by a microchip</li>
  <li>Be vaccinated for rabies subsequently</li>
  <li>Have a veterinary health certificate in the form of Annex IV to
    Commission Implementing Decision 577/2013 to certify that it is currently
    immunised against rabies and dogs must be treated against tapeworm between
    24 and 120 hours before arriving in Ireland. Treatment for ticks is not
    compulsory but it is advisable to get it at the same time as the tapeworm
    treatment.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Non-qualifying high-risk countries</strong></p>

<p>If you are coming from a non-qualifying high-risk country your pet must:</p>
<ul><li>Be microchipped (this must be done before anything else)</li>
  <li>Be vaccinated for rabies subsequently</li>
  <li>Have a blood test after the rabies vaccination at least 3 months before
    entry</li>
  <li>Have a veterinary health certificate in the form of Annex IV to
    Commission Implementing Decision 577/2013 to certify that it is currently
    immunised against rabies and dogs must be treated against tapeworm not more
    than 120 hours and not less than 24 hours before arriving in Ireland.
    Treatment for ticks is not compulsory but it is advisable to get it at the
    same time as the tapeworm treatment.</li>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lcbe70">Travel to Ireland</h2>

<p>The operator of the airline or ferry company is legally obliged under the
Pet Passport (No2) Regulations 2014 to notify the arrival of the animals to the
Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine by email at least 24 hours in
advance to <a href="mailto:petmove@agriculture.gov.ie">petmove@agriculture.gov.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>Travel from EU </h3>

<p><a href="http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/pets/registeredtransportersforcarryingpetsintoirelandfromtheeu/">Airlines
registered with the Department</a> may choose to carry pets complying with the
above regulations. Compliant pets may travel on any ferry. The pet must travel
with its owner or with a person acting on behalf of the owner (unaccompanied
pets cannot travel to Ireland under the EU Pet Passport System).</p>

<h3>Travel from outside the EU</h3>

<p>The animal must be transported by air to Ireland on an <a href="http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/pets/approvedpetcarriersroutes/">approved
airline</a> or pet cargo carrier. You must provide evidence to the airline in
advance that your pet is travelling with you for non-commercial purposes.</p>

<p>Entry to Ireland is by airline into Dublin airport where the pet is checked
to see if it is compliant with the entry requirements.</p>

<h3>Non-compliant pets</h3>

<p>If the pet does not meet the entry requirements it will be returned to the
country of origin at the owner's expense.</p>

an EU Pet Passport from the competent authority in the EU member state of
origin. </p>

<p>If you are importing a pet cat, dog or ferret into Ireland from a qualifying
low-risk country, you should arrange for your veterinarian to microchip and
then vaccinate the pet <span>in that order</span>. </p>

<p>If you are importing a pet cat, dog or ferret into Ireland from a
non-qualifying high-risk country, you should arrange for your veterinarian to
microchip, vaccinate and then bloodtest the pet in that order</p>

Implementing Decision 577/2013. </p>

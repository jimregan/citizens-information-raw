<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are an Irish citizen living outside Ireland and you are planning to
live in Ireland, this document is an overview of what is involved in moving
here. You may be an Irish citizen born outside Ireland who is coming to live in
Ireland for the first time, or you may be returning to Ireland after living and
working abroad for a number of years. In both situations the information about
your rights and entitlements is the same. For older Irish citizens there is
more information in our document, <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/coming-to-live-in-ireland/retiring-to-ireland" shape="rect">Retiring to Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>As an <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/moving-country/irish-citizenship/your_right_to_irish_citizenship" shape="rect">Irish citizen</a> you have a range of rights including the right
to enter and reside in Ireland. Being an Irish citizen means you are recognised
as an Irish national and a citizen of the European Union. If you were born
abroad and your parents or grandparents were Irish, you may be entitled to be
an <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/moving-country/irish-citizenship/irish_citizenship_through_birth_or_descent" shape="rect">Irish citizen by birth or descent</a>. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Returning with a family member</h3>

<p>If you are returning to Ireland with an EEA spouse, civil partner, de facto
partner or other family member, they may enter Ireland freely.</p>

<p>If you are an Irish citizen returning to Ireland with a non-EEA spouse,
civil partner, de facto partner or other family member, you should be aware
that there is no automatic entitlement under Irish law for you to have them
join you in Ireland. They will need to apply for residency permission from the
Irish immigration services. They may also need to apply for a visa before
coming to Ireland. You can find <a href="https://www.migrantproject.ie/index.php/returning-to-ireland/residency-information">information
about applying for residency permission on the Crosscare Migrant Project
website</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<h3 style="border: medium none;">Housing</h3>

<p>You may find that <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/introduction-to-the-irish-system/accommodation" shape="rect">housing </a>is very expensive in Ireland, irrespective of whether
you are thinking of renting or buying a home. If you want to <a href="../../../housing/owning_a_home/buying_a_home/steps_involved_buying_a_home.html">buy
a home</a> you need to be aware of the price trends in Ireland, the process by
which houses are bought and sold and the initial costs that are involved. There
are no restrictions on the purchase or rent of residential property or land.
Rental accommodation comes in many forms including houses, flats and
apartments. You will need to know about <a href="../../../housing/renting_a_home/looking_for_a_flat_or_house_to_rent.html">renting
a home</a>. The <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/housing/renting-a-home/tenants_rights_and_obligations" shape="rect">rights of tenants in Ireland</a> do not include as much security
of tenure as in other countries.</p>

<p>If you are thinking of returning, <a href="http://www.safehomeireland.com/">Safe Home Ireland</a> provides
information, advice and support to Irish emigrants wishing to return or move to
Ireland.</p>

<h3 style="border: medium none;">Working </h3>

<p>If you are normally resident in Ireland, you are <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/health/entitlement-to-health-services/entitlement_to_public_health_services" shape="rect">entitled to a range of health services</a> that are either free of
charge or subsidised by the Irish Government. You are considered to be normally
resident if you are planning to live in Ireland for a year or more. Depending
on your income, you may be eligible for a <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/health/entitlement-to-health-services/medical_card" shape="rect">medical card</a> which entitles you to certain health services at
no cost. <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/health/entitlement-to-health-services/gp_visit_cards" shape="rect">GP Visit Cards</a> entitle you to free GP (family doctor) visits.
You will need to know <a href="../../../health/health_service_agencies/health_boards.html">how public
health services are organised</a> in Ireland.</p>

<p>In addition to the public health system, people in Ireland can avail of a
range of private health care services. You must pay the full costs of treatment
if you opt for private health care. There are a number of <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/health/health-insurance/private_health_insurance" shape="rect">private health insurance</a> companies in Ireland. </p>

<h3 style="border: medium none;">Education</h3>

<p>If you are moving to Ireland with your family you can find information about
<a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/studying-in-ireland/education_in_ireland" shape="rect">education in Ireland</a>. Children are entitled to free education
in publicly funded <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-primary-school" shape="rect">primary</a> and <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-post-primary-school" shape="rect">second-level schools.</a> For <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/education/pre-school-education-and-childcare/early_childhood_education" shape="rect">pre-school children</a> there is a range of <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/education/pre-school-education-and-childcare/your-childcare-options" shape="rect">childcare options</a>.

<h3 style="border: medium none;">Social security entitlements</h3>

<p>There may be some significant differences between the <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social_welfare_system_in_ireland" shape="rect">social security system here</a> and the country where you live so
it will be worthwhile familiarising yourself with any differences in advance.
You can find out more about <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/introduction-to-the-irish-system/moving_to_ireland_and_your_social_security_entitlements" shape="rect">moving to Ireland and your social security entitlements.</a></p>

<p>If you work in Ireland and pay at least one <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland" shape="rect">Class A PRSI contribution</a>, your social insurance contributions
<a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Social-Insurance-and-EC-Regulations.aspx"><span class="link-external">paid in another EU/EEA country</span></a> can help you
qualify for a social insurance payment such as <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/disability-and-illness/disability_benefit" shape="rect">Illness Benefit</a> or <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers_benefit" shape="rect">Jobseeker.s Benefit.</a> You should bring a record of your social
insurance contributions using forms E104 and U1 (formerly E301) which you can
get from your local social security office. If you have been getting
unemployment benefit for 4 weeks, you may transfer it to Ireland for up to 3
months if you bring a completed form U2 (formerly E303). Certain other social
security benefits from another European Economic Area (EEA) country or
Switzerland may also be transferred to Ireland, but not means-tested payments.
The European Economic Area consists of the member states of the European Union,
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. You should check with the social security
agency in the country where you live.</p>

<p>If you live outside the EEA you should find out if there is a <span class="link-external"><a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Bilateral-Social-Security-Agreements-with-Other-Countries.aspx">Bilateral
Social Security Agreement</a></span> between Ireland and the country you are
leaving as this allows your social insurance contributions to be taken into
account for the State contributory pension. You can find out more in our
document, <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/social-insurance-contributions-from-abroad" shape="rect">Combining social insurance contributions from abroad</a>. </p>

<p>If you do not have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions you may
qualify for a means-tested payment such as <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance" shape="rect">Jobseeker's Allowance</a>. You should know that there is a <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland" shape="rect">residency requirement to qualify for social assistance
payments</a> in Ireland. </p>

<h3>Private pension</h3>

<p>Returning emigrants should be aware that the conditions governing any
possibility to transfer or access pension savings established in a jurisdiction
outside of Ireland will be determined primarily by the rules and regulations
applying to pension transfers in that jurisdiction. These rules and regulations
differ significantly from country to country and may be influenced by a wide
range of factors. The Department of Social Protection provide <a href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Transfer-of-Private-Pensions-to-Ireland-for-returning-Irish-Emigrants.aspx">general
information for returning Irish emigrants regarding the transfer of private
pensions to Ireland</a>.</p>

<h3 style="border: medium none;">Driving, cars and transport</h3>

<p>Full driving licences from all other EU member states (and some other
countries) are recognised for use in Ireland. It may be possible to <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/travel-and-recreation/motoring-1/driver-licensing/exchanging_foreign_driving_permit" shape="rect">convert your driving licence to an Irish one</a>. If you want to

<h3 style="border: medium none;">Other issues for people moving to Ireland</h3>

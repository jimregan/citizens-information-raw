<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>In general, all vehicles brought into Ireland are subject to Vehicle
Registration Tax (VRT) and must be registered. If you are moving to Ireland or
are already living here and you are importing a car or other vehicle, you will
need to do 4 things before you can drive your vehicle in Ireland: </p>
<ul><li>Pay Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) (unless you are exempt) </li>
  <li>Get new vehicle registration plates</li>
  <li>Get motor insurance </li>
  <li>Pay motor tax </li>
</ul><p>All motorists are required to carry a valid driving licence with them at all
times when driving in Ireland. Driving licences include <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/driver_licensing/full_driving_licence.html">full
licences</a>, <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/driver_licensing/international_driving_permit.html">international
driving licences</a> and <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/driver_licensing/learner_driving_permits_for_cars_and_work_vehicles.html">Irish
learner permits</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lf752b">Vehicle Registration Tax</h2>

<p>Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) is a tax you must pay when you first register
a motor vehicle in Ireland. If you have imported a vehicle, you must pay VRT
and receive the vehicle's registration certificate showing that you have paid
VRT. Any delay in registering your vehicle or paying Vehicle Registration Tax
will make you liable to substantial penalties - including forfeiture of your
vehicle and prosecution. </p>

<p>You must register the car and pay the VRT at a National Car Testing Service
(NCTS) centre - see 'How to apply' below. Your car will be examined to ensure
that you are paying the correct VRT. In the case of cars and small vans, the
amount of VRT payable is based on a percentage of the recommended retail price,
which includes all taxes. This price is known as the Open Market Selling Price
(OMSP). You can get an estimate of the VRT due from the <a shape="rect" href="https://www.ros.ie/VRTEnquiryServlet/ShowVRT">Revenue Vehicle
Registration Online Enquiry System.</a></p>

<p>When enquiring about VRT rates, you need to provide specific information
about your vehicle. Revenue have also produced a <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/vrt-guide.html">guide to VRT which is a
list of frequently asked questions about VRT in Ireland</a>. They have also
produced a <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/co2-emissions-based-vrt.html">guide to
the CO2-based VRT for cars</a>.</p>

<p>If you feel you are being over-charged, you can appeal it with Revenue using
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/leaflets/vrt-appeals.html">the VRT
appeals procedure</a>. This leaflet is also available from any local Revenue
office. The addresses of the appeals officers are listed at the end of the
leaflet.</p>

<h3>Exemptions </h3>

<p>There are different reliefs and exemptions from VRT. Even if you are not
required to pay VRT, you must still register your vehicle when you come to
Ireland. <span>You can find <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/reliefs-exemptions.html">information</a>
and <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/forms/index.html#section3">forms</a> for
VRT reliefs and exemptions on the Revenue website.</span> </p>

<p><strong>Transferring residence:</strong> If you are moving to live in
Ireland, when you apply for a VRT exemption, you must meet certain requirements
as regards your vehicle and your residency both here and abroad. You can find
information about when to apply for exemption, the evidence you need and the
application forms in the Revenue leaflet, <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/leaflets/tax-relief-transfer-residence.html">Transfer
of Residence</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Temporary exemptions:</strong> In certain cases foreign-registered
vehicles may be imported into Ireland temporarily by a non-resident without the
requirement to pay VRT or register the vehicle. You can find information about
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/leaflets/temporary-exemption-foreign-registered.html">Foreign
Registered Vehicles Temporary Exemptions</a> on the Revenue website.</p>

<p>If you are moving to Ireland and are among those exempt from paying VRT you
cannot sell your vehicle for more than 12 months after the vehicle is
registered. If you are required to pay VRT, then you can sell your vehicle here
in Ireland when you wish, once it has been registered. </p>

<p>If you have a query about VRT exemptions, appeals or transfer of residence,
the Revenue contact details are listed <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/contact-details.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Export repayment scheme</h3>

<p>If you are permanently removing or exporting a car from the State, you may
be able to claim a repayment of the VRT that had been paid previously.
Information about the <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/export-repayment-scheme/index.html">Export
Repayment Scheme and claim forms</a> are available on revenue.ie.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="la6a26">VAT, insurance, motor tax and NCT</h2>

<h3>VAT</h3>

<p>If you are importing a new car from another EU country you have to pay VAT
(Value Added Tax), usually when registering the car. A new car means a car that
has been in service for 6 months or less, or has been driven for 6,000
kilometres or less. The VAT is payable even where you have paid VAT in the
other country.</p>

<p>If you are importing a new or second hand car from outside the EU, VAT (and
customs duty) is payable. Customs duty is paid when the vehicle first enters
the EU, at the point of entry. You must have proof of payment of this when you
are registering the car in Ireland - see 'How to apply' below.</p>

<h3>Vehicle registration plates</h3>

<p>When you register and pay the VRT, a registration number will be assigned to
your car – see ‘How to apply’ below. You must display the registration
number within 3 days. Failure to display the new registration number is an
offence and you can be fined by An Garda Síochána. You can obtain <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel_and_recreation/vehicle_standards/vehicle_registration_numbers.html">vehicle
registration plates</a> from the NCTS centre or any motor factor. </p>

<h3>Motor insurance</h3>

<p>It is a legal requirement in Ireland to have motor insurance if you want to
drive a motor vehicle in a public place. You will need to have motor insurance
before you can pay motor tax. You can find more information in our document on
<a href="../../../travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/motor_tax_and_insurance/motor_insurance.html">motor
insurance</a>.</p>

<h3>Motor tax</h3>

<p>Motor tax in Ireland is a charge imposed by the Irish Government on motor
vehicles. Some vehicles are exempt but must display a current tax disc if used
in a public place . Your Vehicle Registration Certificate will be issued to you
by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport when you pay your motor tax.
There is more information in our document on <a href="../../../travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/motor_tax_and_insurance/motor_tax_rates.html">motor
tax</a>. </p>

<h3>National Car Test</h3>

<p>If your vehicle is 4 years old or more it will have to go through the
National Car Test (NCT) <strong>immediately.</strong> This applies even if the
vehicle has previously received an MOT or any other vehicle test abroad. The
NCT test certificate will be valid until the next test due date. After that if
the vehicle is still in Ireland it must be tested again. You can find more
information in our document on the <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/vehicle_standards/national_car_test.html">National
Car Test.</a> </p>

<h3>Disposing of a car</h3>

<p>If you want to dispose of your car either due to age (typically around 12-14
years), or because of heavy damage following an accident, it must be deposited
at an authorised treatment facility. There is more information in our document
on <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/buying_or_selling_a_vehicle/how_to_dispose_of_an_end_of_life_vehicle.html">how
to dispose of an end-of-life vehicle.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) is based on the Open Market Selling Price
(OMSP) of the vehicle. The OMSP depends on the market value, engine size, year,
model and roadworthiness condition of the vehicle. </p>

<p>After the vehicle has been inspected the rate of VRT is calculated by
Revenue. The VRT is collected by the NCTS on behalf of Revenue. You can pay by
bank draft (payable to Applus Car Testing Service), debit card or credit card.
If you are using a debit card to pay, the transaction is limited to €2,500
per day. If the VRT payment exceeds this amount, you can pay the balance by
bank draft. </p>

<p>VRT for cars (Category A) is based on the level of <strong>CO2
emissions</strong> from the car. On the Sustainable Energy Authority of
Ireland's (SEAI) website you can check the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.sei.ie/Your_Home/How_Clean_is_Your_Car_/">CO2 emissions levels
for different car models</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>In order to register and pay the VRT you must bring your car for an
inspection to your <a shape="rect" href="https://www.ncts.ie/1106">local
designated NCTS centre</a>. You must <a shape="rect" href="https://www.ncts.ie/1145">book an appointment with the NCTS</a> within 7
days of your car's arrival into Ireland and you must complete the registration
process within 30 days of your arrival. </p>

<p>Since 12 September 2016, all new motor vehicles (i.e. vehicles not
previously registered) being registered for the first time in Ireland are
required to have an <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/certificate-of-conformity.html">electronic
Certificate of Conformity (e-CoC)</a>. Before your vehicle is registered, if
you only have a paper version of your e-CoC, you must manually input the
details onto the Revenue system. You can find <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/ecoc-procedures-manual.pdf">guidelines
(pdf)</a> on revenue.ie.</p>

<p>You must have a <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">Personal
Public Service Number (PPS number)</a>, proof of identity (for example your
passport or driving licence) and other specified documents in order to register
and pay the VRT. There is a <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/vrt-guide.html#section2e">list of the
documents required on revenue.ie</a>. You must also be able to locate the
chassis number for the vehicle inspector when presenting the vehicle for
inspection.</p>

<p>At the inspection the vehicle will be examined to ensure its characteristics
match those recorded in the registration documentation. The details will be
used by Revenue to assess the amount of VRT payable, based on the value of the
car. You pay the VRT charged to the NCTS. The registration process must be
completed within 30 days of the vehicle's arrival in Ireland.</p>

<p>Once the vehicle has been registered and the VRT paid, you will receive:</p>
<ul><li>A receipt for the VRT paid showing the registration number assigned to
    your car. You must display the registration number within 3 days. You can
    obtain vehicle registration plates from the NCTS centre or any motor
  factor.</li>
  <li>A Form RF100 for use when you are applying to pay motor tax. To pay motor
    tax, you will need to insure the car and have your insurance details. You
    can pay motor tax online at <a href="https://www.motortax.ie/OMT/welcome.do;jsessionid=0aa0114830d7ca2b808101634f9eb827a5f0cbdb3582.e38PaNaSbhuOay0MahmSe0">motortax.ie</a>
    or at the Motor Taxation Office of your local authority. After you have
    paid the motor tax, the Vehicle Registration Certificate will be issued to
    you by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</li>
</ul><p>If the car is 4 years old or more it must also undergo the National Car Test
immediately – see ‘National Car Test’ above.</p>

<p>There is detailed information about the <a href="https://www.ncts.ie/1155">registration process</a> on the NCTS website.

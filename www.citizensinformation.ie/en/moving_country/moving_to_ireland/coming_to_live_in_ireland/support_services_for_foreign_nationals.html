<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>There is a range of supports for foreign nationals in Ireland and this
document is an overview of some of the various public and voluntary supports
available. People come to Ireland from other countries for a variety of
reasons; for example, as tourists or short-term visitors. Many foreign
nationals are <a shape="rect" href="../working_in_ireland/coming_to_work_in_ireland.html">working</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../studying_in_ireland/education_in_ireland.html">studying</a> here while
others have <a shape="rect" href="retiring_to_ireland.html">retired to
Ireland</a>. Some people may be looking for protection and intend to <a shape="rect" href="../../asylum_seekers_and_refugees/the_asylum_process_in_ireland/refugees_asylum_seekers_introduction.html">apply
for refugee status or other protection</a>. If you are <a shape="rect" href="../">moving to Ireland</a> you need find out information about living
here including <a shape="rect" href="../introduction_to_the_irish_system/accommodation.html">housing</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../rights_of_residence_in_ireland/">residency</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../introduction_to_the_irish_system/health_care_in_ireland.html">health
services</a> and <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/migrant_workers/">employment</a>. </p>

<h3>Garda Racial, Intercultural and Diversity Office</h3>

<p>The Garda Racial, Intercultural and Diversity Office (GRIDO) is responsible
for advising, monitoring and co-ordinating police activity around racial,
ethnic, religious and cultural diversity. A recording mechanism captures data
concerning racially motivated incidents. This data is made available to all
Garda stations in the country so every incident is logged and reports and
complaints can be tracked. Ethnic Liaison Officers (ELOs) monitor racist
incidents. They also liaise with representatives of the various minority
communities and with victims of racist incidents to ensure that they are
afforded adequate protection. GRIDO maintains relationships with all
communities through initiatives which promote mutual awareness and
understanding. Links have also been established with services providing <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/victims_of_crime/victim_support.html">support to
victims of crime </a>concerning racial issues. </p>

<h3>Irish Tourist Assistance Service</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/crime_and_crime_prevention/safety_advice_visitors_to_ireland.html">Taking
basic precautions can help you avoid being a victim of crime</a>. If however
you have experienced crime, the Irish Tourist Assistance Service (ITAS) can be
of help. ITAS is a free nationwide service offering support and assistance to
tourists who are victimised while visiting Ireland. It can liaise with
embassies or consulates, help with language difficulties, deal with medical
needs, arrange accommodation or meals if needed and help to replace stolen
travel tickets. Remember however, ITAS <strong>does not provide financial
assistance</strong> to victims of crime, replace lost or stolen items or offer
legal or insurance advice.</p>

<h3>Foreign embassies and consulates</h3>

<p>There are a number of <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=376">foreign embassies and
consulates in Ireland</a> that provide consular services to nationals of their
country. These services include advice and practical help with travel
documentation. If you lose your passport or travel documentation when you are
in Ireland, you will need to contact your country’s embassy or consulate. It
can issue you with temporary travel documents. Your embassy or consulate can
also be of assistance to you in the case of a medical emergency. They can
advise relatives or friends about accidents or illnesses, act as a liaison with
hospitals and doctors and arrange for interpretative services, if necessary. If
you are the victim of a crime while in Ireland, your embassy or consulate can
liaise with local police and let your friends and family know of your
situation. Likewise, if you have been arrested or imprisoned, your embassy or
consulate can put you in contact with suitable legal representation, ensure
that your rights are respected and advise you of your entitlements. If a member
of your family dies while abroad, your embassy or consulate can assist you in
dealing with the formalities, such as death certificates and police reports.</p>

<h3>Immigrant Council of Ireland</h3>

<p>The Immigrant Council of Ireland (ICI) is an independent, national
organisation which supports migrants coming to Ireland for purposes such as
work, study, family reunification, self-employment or to visit. The ICI
provides an information service and a limited legal service to immigrants. It
also offers a training service, organises public events and produces
publications on immigrant issues such as citizenship and residency, visas,
employment permits, family reunification and voluntary return. The ICI works
with immigrant groups to try and improve government policy on issues relating
to immigrants and to campaign for immigrants rights. It has produced a
directory of ethnic-led organisations which is a resource for people seeking
contacts within the migrant communities, with the media, service providers or
businesses. The ICI has started regular clinics offering free and confidential
employment law advice for migrant workers.</p>

<h3>Migrant Rights Centre</h3>

<p>The Migrant Rights Centre (MRC) is a national organisation which provides
support to migrant workers and their families. It targets families in
vulnerable circumstances and tries to improve their social and economic
conditions. The MRC operates a drop-in centre which provides information,
advice and assistance. It also encourages migrants to get involved in their
community and actively participate in all levels of society. </p>

<h3>Crosscare Migrant Project</h3>

<p>Crosscare Migrant Project (formerly Emigrant Advice) provides information,
support and advocacy to migrants. It provides its information and referral
service to immigrants and members of new communities living in Ireland, as well
as to intending, existing and returning Irish emigrants. Its website <a href="http://www.livinginireland.ie/">livinginireland.ie</a> is a guide to all
aspects of living in Ireland and is available in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.livinginireland.ie/">English,</a> <a shape="rect" href="http://www.livinginireland.ie/br">Brazilian Portuguese</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.livinginireland.ie/ar//">Arabic</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.livinginireland.ie/ru">Russian</a> and <a shape="rect" href="http://www.livinginireland.ie/ch">Chinese</a>.</p>

<h3>Reception and Integration Agency</h3>

<p>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is responsible for co-ordinating
the provision of services to both asylum seekers and people granted
international protection (refugee status or subsidiary protection) in Ireland.
It deals with integration policy for people who have international protection
and people who have been granted leave to remain in the State. It arranges
accommodation and works with statutory and non-statutory agencies to
co-ordinate the delivery of other services (including health, social services,
welfare and education) for asylum seekers and people who have international
protection. The RIA is also responsible for responding to crisis situations
which result in large numbers of refugees arriving in Ireland within a short
period of time.</p>

<h3>Scheme of repatriation</h3>

<p>The Reception and Integration Agency works with the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/">Department of Social Protection</a> to support
the repatriation of nationals of the new EU member states. The scheme applies
to people who have failed the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitual
residency condition</a> attaching to social assistance payments. Any citizen of
a former EU accession state, and certain other ‘special-case’ EU nationals,
who find themselves destitute during their time in Ireland can apply for
repatriation. If you wish to apply for this scheme you should contact the
Department of Social Protection's representative (formerly known as the
Community Welfare Officer) at <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/">your local health
centre</a>.</p>

<h3>Scheme of voluntary assisted return<br></h3>

<p>If you are an asylum seeker or an irregular migrant from an non-EEA country
who wishes to return voluntarily to your country of origin but do not have the
means to do so, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) may be able
to assist you to return home. The IOM is an independent international
organisation working in the field of migration - see 'Where to apply' below.
Its <a href="http://iomireland.ie/return/">Voluntary Assisted Return and
Reintegration Scheme</a> can help you with appropriate travel documentation and
arrange for transit and arrival assistance if needed. When you travel with the
IOM, you travel independently and without an escort. The reasons for your stay
in Ireland remain confidential and are not shared with anybody outside the
voluntary return process. If you return voluntarily and you have no outstanding
criminal court proceedings, you may apply to re-enter Ireland legally for the
purpose of work, study, etc.</p>

<h3>Citizens Information</h3>

<p>Citizens Information is a comprehensive source of information on public
services in Ireland including issues such as residence rights, employment
rights, health services, housing, social security entitlements and general
information about moving to Ireland. Citizens Information is available by
telephone through the Citizens Information Phone Service or in person by
calling to a Citizens Information Centre (CIC) near you. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you are ordinarily resident in Ireland you are entitled to public health
services on the same basis as Irish nationals. Further information on health
services is available from your <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">Local Health Office.</a> </p>

<p>If you are entitled to a social welfare payment in Ireland, you will need to
visit your <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/List-of-Social-Welfare-Local-and-Branch-Offices-by-County.aspx">Intreo
centre or social welfare office</a>. </p>

<p>If you are <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/losing_your_home/homelessness.html">homeless</a>, you should
contact <a shape="rect" href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">your
local authority</a> for information about accommodation. Threshold, a voluntary
organisation, provides advice and support to people who are homeless or at risk
of becoming homeless. You can also get advice about your situation from your
nearest Citizens Information Centre.</p>

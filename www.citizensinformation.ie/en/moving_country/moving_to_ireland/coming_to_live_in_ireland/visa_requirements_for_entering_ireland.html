<p>People from certain countries need a valid Irish entry visa before arriving
in the State, whether by air, sea or land. An Irish visa is a certificate
placed on your passport or travel document to indicate that you are <a shape="rect" href="permission_to_land_in_ireland.html">authorised to land in
the State</a> subject to any other conditions of landing being fulfilled. This
means that you will still be subject to immigration control at the point of
entry to the State even if you have a visa. You may also need to <a shape="rect" href="../rights_of_residence_in_ireland/registration_of_non_eea_nationals_in_ireland.html">register
with the immigration authorities</a>. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l0aabc">Who needs an entry visa?</h2>

<h3>No visa required</h3>

<p>You <strong>do not need a visa</strong> to land in Ireland if you are a
citizen of the <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Who-needs-an-Employment-Permit-/European-Economic-Area-EEA-/">EEA</a>
or of one of the countries listed in the table in 'Further information' below.
The list of countries whose citizens do not require a visa to enter Ireland is
defined in the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/si/0473.html">Immigration Act 2004
(Visas) Order 2014 (SI 473/2014)</a> as amended by <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2015/en/si/0175.html">SI 175/2015</a> and
<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/si/513/made/en/print">SI
513/2015</a>.</p>

<h3>Who else can land in Ireland without a visa?</h3>

<p>You do not need a visa to land in Ireland if:</p>
<ul><li>You hold a valid travel document issued in accordance with <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Convention%20travel%20documents">Article
    28 of the Geneva Convention</a> </li>
  <li>You hold either a valid residence card 4 EU FAM or a valid permanent
    residence card 4 EU FAM issued under the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/EU%20Treaty%20Rights">European
    Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2015</a></li>
  <li>You are a family member of an EU citizen and you hold a document called
    "<a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Residence%20card%20of%20a%20family%20member%20of%20a%20European%20Union%20Citizen">Residence
    card of a family member of a Union citizen" </a></li>
</ul><h3>Visa required</h3>

<p>You will <strong>need a visa</strong> if you are a citizen of one of the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/visa-required-countries">countries
whose nationals require a visa to enter Ireland</a>. You can find <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Irish%20Visa%20Information">detailed
information on the application procedures</a> on the website of the Irish
Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS). It is advisable to consult their
website before applying for your visa, to make sure that you have the most
up-to-date information. You can read this list of <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Frequently%20asked%20questions">frequently
asked questions about visas.</a></p>

<p><strong>Family member of EU national:</strong> If you are a non-EEA national
coming to Ireland from another EU country as a <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Family%20Members%20of%20EU_EEA%20_Swiss%20citizens">dependant
of an EU national</a>, and you do not hold a document called "Residence card of
a family member of a Union citizen", you may <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Countries%20whose%20nationals%20are%20visa%20required">need
a visa</a> when you first travel to Ireland. If you plan to stay for more than
3 months, you should <a shape="rect" href="../rights_of_residence_in_ireland/residence_rights_eu_national.html">register
with the immigration authorities and apply for a residence card</a>. If you
receive a residence card, you will not need a re-entry visa for travel into
Ireland in future.</p>

<h3>Types of visa</h3>

<p>If you wish to visit Ireland for a period of less than 3 months, for
example, on holidays, to pursue a short course of studies or for business
meetings, then you can apply for a <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/short%20stay%20visas%20(less%20than%203%20months)">short
stay ‘C’ visa</a> for either a single entry or <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Will%20my%20visa%20be%20valid%20for%20multiple%20trips%20to%20Ireland">multiple
entries</a>. The maximum stay allowed under a short stay ‘C’ visa is 90
days. If you enter the State on a ‘C’ visa you cannot have your permission
to remain in the State extended. You must leave and reapply from outside the
State if you want to return.</p>

<p>If you wish to travel to Ireland for more than 3 months, for example to
pursue a course of study, for work or to settle permanently in Ireland with
family members who are already resident in Ireland, then you can apply for a <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Long%20Stay%20Visas%20(More%20than%203%20months)">long
stay ‘D’ visa</a> for a single entry. If you are granted a long stay
‘D’ visa and wish to remain in the State for longer than 3 months, or
beyond the period of leave granted to you by an Immigration Officer at an Irish
port of entry you will be required to register and obtain a residence
permit.</p>

<p>You can read more information about the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Apply%20for%20a%20visa">different

visas.</a> </p>

<h3>Transit visas</h3>

<p>People from a small number of countries also need a <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Transit%20Visas">transit visa</a>
when arriving in Ireland on their way to another country. A transit visa does
not permit you to leave the port or airport. If you are a citizen of one of the
following countries, you will need a valid Irish transit visa when landing in
the State:</p>

<h3>Visa waiver and reciprocal visa arrangement</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Irish%20Short%20Stay%20Visa%20Waiver%20Programme">Short
Stay Visa Waiver Programme</a> allows nationals of a number of Eastern
European, Middle Eastern and Asian countries who have a short-term UK visa, to
come to Ireland without the need for a separate Irish visa. The Programme has
been extended to 31 October 2021.</p>

<p>Under a new <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/British%20Irish%20Visa%20Scheme">British
Irish Visa Scheme (BIVS)</a>, visitors from China can travel freely within the
<a href="../../moving_abroad/freedom_of_movement_within_the_eu/common_travel_area_between_ireland_and_the_uk.html">Common
Travel Area</a>, (that is, Ireland and the UK, but not the Channel Islands and
the Isle of Man), using either an Irish or UK short-stay visa endorsed with
'BIVS'. Since 9 February 2015 the Scheme has been <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Minister%20for%20Justice%20announces%20extension%20of%20the%20British-Irish%20Visa%20Scheme%20to%20India">extended
to visitors from India</a>. The Scheme operates through a reciprocal visa
arrangement, whereby Ireland and the UK recognise short-stay visas issued by
the other for travel to their jurisdiction. </p>

<h3>Re-entry visas</h3>

<p>The first visa issued to you is valid for a single entry to the State. If
you wish to leave the State for a short period of time you must <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Re-entry%20visas">apply for a
re-entry visa.</a> This includes travel to Northern Ireland when you will need
a re-entry visa to re-enter the State. Before you can get a re-entry visa you
must be registered with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The standard non-refundable visa application processing fees are:</p>

<p><strong>Entry and re-entry visas</strong></p>

<p>A <strong>single journey visa</strong> costs <strong>€60</strong> and will
be valid for one entry to the State up to a maximum of 90 days from the date of
issue.</p>

<p>A <strong>multi journey visa</strong> costs <strong>€100</strong> and will
be valid for multiple entries to the State up to a maximum of 5 years from the
date of issue.</p>

<p>A <strong>transit visa</strong> costs <strong>€25.</strong></p>

<p>There may also be communications charges in some cases. Information about
these charges, and on the fee in your local currency, is available from your
local Irish embassy or consulate.</p>

<h3>Who does not pay the fee?</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/fees">Some applicants are not
required to pay a fee</a>. This includes visa-required spouses and certain
family members of EEA citizens (including Irish nationals) provided that proof
of the relationship is provided with the application. In addition, applicants
from some countries are not required to pay a fee. As this changes from time to
time, you should check with your local Irish embassy or consulate, or with the
Visa Office - see 'Where to apply'.   </p>

<p>Nationals of the countries covered by the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Irish%20Short%20Stay%20Visa%20Waiver%20Programme">Short-stay
Visa Waiver Programme</a> who are long-term legal residents of the UK or the
Schengen area will still require a visa but will not have to pay the visa
fee.</p>

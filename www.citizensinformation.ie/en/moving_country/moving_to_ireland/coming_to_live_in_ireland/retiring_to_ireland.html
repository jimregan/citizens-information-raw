<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are thinking of retiring to Ireland, you need to find out about the
practicalities involved in moving to Ireland from another country. The
following information outlines the key issues to consider and check and may
help you to make a smooth transition from abroad to this country. </p>

<h3>Residence rights </h3>

<p>Not everyone has the right to come and live in Ireland. Your right to reside
here, depends on your nationality and your particular situation.</p>
<ul><li><strong>EEA and Swiss nationals</strong>: Irish citizens returning to
    Ireland have an automatic right to reside here and <a href="../rights_of_residence_in_ireland/residence_rules_UK_citizens.html">UK
    citizens</a> may live in Ireland without any conditions or restrictions. <a shape="rect" href="../rights_of_residence_in_ireland/residence_rights_eu_national.html">EEA
    and Swiss nationals have the right to stay in Ireland and your family
    members have the right to stay here</a>. There are however some limits to
    this right. EEA and Swiss nationals and their families can remain in
    Ireland for up to 3 months without restriction. If you are retired and plan
    to stay more than 3 months, you must have sufficient resources and sickness
    insurance to ensure that you do not become a burden on the State, or you
    must be employed or self-employed. (The European Economic Area (EEA)
    comprises the member states of the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein
    and Norway.) <strong></strong></li>
  <li><strong>Non-EEA nationals:</strong> citizens of certain non-EEA countries
    must apply for an entry visa before they travel to Ireland. You can find
    out if you need a <a shape="rect" href="visa_requirements_for_entering_ireland.html">visa to enter
    Ireland</a>. When you have arrived in Ireland, if you are not an EEA or
    Swiss national, you must have <a shape="rect" href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Information%20Leaflet.doc/Files/Information%20Leaflet.doc">permission
    to remain</a> if you wish to stay for more than 3 months. If you are
    retiring to live in Ireland, you must be able to prove you have <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Stamp%200">sufficient
    resources</a> to support yourself and obtain permission to remain by <a shape="rect" href="../rights_of_residence_in_ireland/registration_of_non_eea_nationals_in_ireland.html">registering
    with your local immigration registration officer</a> following your arrival
    in Ireland. </li>
</ul><h3>Housing</h3>

<p>You may find that <a shape="rect" href="../introduction_to_the_irish_system/accommodation.html">housing</a> is
expensive in Ireland, irrespective of whether you are thinking of renting or
buying a home. If you want to <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/owning_a_home/buying_a_home/">buy a home in Ireland</a> you need
to be aware of the prices, the process by which houses are bought and sold and
the initial costs that are involved. There are no restrictions on the purchase
or rent of residential property or land. <a href="../../../housing/renting_a_home/looking_for_a_flat_or_house_to_rent.html">Rented
accommodation</a> comes in many forms including houses, flats and apartments.
</p>

<p>If you are thinking of returning, <a href="http://www.safehomeireland.com/">Safe Home Ireland</a> provides
information, advice and support to Irish emigrants wishing to return or move to
Ireland.</p>

<h3>Health services </h3>

<p>If you are normally resident in Ireland, you are entitled to a range of
health services that are either free of charge or subsidised by the Irish
Government. If you are planning to retire in Ireland you should find out about
<a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/entitlement_to_public_health_services.html">entitlement
to public health services</a>. Depending on your income, you may be eligible
for a <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical
card</a> which entitles you to certain health services at no cost. <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/gp_visit_cards.html">GP Visit
Cards</a> entitle you to free GP Visits. </p>

<p>In addition to the public health system, people in Ireland can avail of a
range of private health care services. You must pay the full costs of treatment
if you opt for private health care. There are a number of <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/health_insurance/private_health_insurance.html">private health
insurance</a> companies in Ireland. If you are normally resident in Ireland,
you are entitled to the same benefits from your private health insurance as any
other Irish citizen. Your private health insurance premium attracts tax relief
at the standard rate (20%). </p>

<h3>Social security entitlements<br></h3>

<p>If you are thinking of coming here to retire, you should find out about the
<a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_welfare_system_in_ireland.html">social
security system in Ireland</a>. There may be some significant differences
between the system here and your home country. You need to find out more about
<a shape="rect" href="../introduction_to_the_irish_system/moving_to_ireland_and_your_social_security_entitlements.html">moving
to Ireland and your social security entitlements</a>. There is a <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">residency
requirement to qualify for social assistance payments in Ireland. <br></a></p>

<h3>Pensions </h3>

<p>Most long-term contributory pensions such as old age or widowed pensions can
be paid in any country so you can have your pension from another country paid
in Ireland. There is information available about <a shape="rect" href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/">pensions in
Ireland.</a> If you have worked in more than one <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Social-Insurance-and-EC-Regulations.aspx">EU/EEA
country </a>or in a country with which Ireland has a <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Bilateral-Social-Security-Agreements-with-Other-Countries.aspx">Bilateral
Social Security Agreement</a> then your periods of insurance can be combined
with Irish insurance to see if you would qualify for a pension from each
country. If you are getting a pension under EU Regulations or a Bilateral
Agreement you may be eligible for the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/extra_social_welfare_benefits/household_benefits_package.html">Household
Benefits Package</a>.</p>

<h3>Taxation </h3>

<p>If you are moving to Ireland you need to know about <a shape="rect" href="../../money_and_tax/tax_and_taxation/tax_residence_and_domicile_in_ireland.html">residency
for tax purposes</a>. You can find out about <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/">income tax credits
and reliefs</a> and how <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/taxation_of_pensions.html">pensions
are taxed</a>. There are some <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/older_peoples_tax_credits_and_reliefs.html">special
tax arrangements for people aged 65</a> or over and <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/taxation_and_medical_expenses.html">tax
relief is available for certain medical expenses including nursing home
costs</a>.</p>

<h3>Working in retirement <br></h3>

<p>Some retired people may only have retired from one occupation. Retiring from
work therefore may simply signal a career change. Not everyone has an automatic
right to work in Ireland - so check in advance whether you require permission
to <a shape="rect" href="../working_in_ireland/coming_to_work_in_ireland.html">work in
Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>Most legislation dealing with the protection of employees in Ireland does
not have an upper age limit. This means that if you are <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/retirement/older_people_and_working/working_in_retirement.html">working
in retirement</a>, then you have the same employment rights as everyone else.
If you decide to work part-time, you can find out about <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/types_of_employment/part_time_employment/employment_rights_of_part_time_workers.html">employment
rights of part-time workers.<br></a></p>

<h3>Driving, cars and transport<br></h3>

<p>Full driving licences from all other EU member states (and some other
countries) are recognised for use in Ireland. You may be able to <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/driver_licensing/exchanging_foreign_driving_permit.html">convert
your driving licence to an Irish one</a>. If you want to bring your car to
Ireland you need to know about <a shape="rect" href="importing_car_into_ireland.html">importing a car</a> and implications for
Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT). If you are aged over 66 and living permanently
in Ireland you are entitled to <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/extra_social_welfare_benefits/free_travel.html">free
travel on public bus and rail transport</a>.</p>

<h3>Other issues for people moving to Ireland</h3>

<p>There are strict regulations about <a href="bringing_pets_to_ireland.html">importing pets from abroad</a> and
there are <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/travel_to_ireland/customs_regulations_for_travellers.html">customs
regulations about the importation of prohibited or restricted goods</a>. </p>

<p>Irish citizens living in Ireland have the right to vote in all elections and
referenda. If you are living in Ireland but are not an Irish citizen you may <a href="../introduction_to_the_irish_system/right_to_vote.html">vote in some
elections</a>. You can read about the <a shape="rect" href="../introduction_to_the_irish_system/political_system.html">political
system at national level</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../introduction_to_the_irish_system/local_government.html">the political

people.</p>

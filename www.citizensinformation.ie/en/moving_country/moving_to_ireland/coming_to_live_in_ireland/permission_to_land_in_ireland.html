<p>Irish citizens are entitled to enter Ireland. If you are a national of the
<a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/eu-eea-countries">European
Economic Area (EEA)</a> or of Switzerland you may be prevented from entering
Ireland only in very restricted circumstances – see ‘EEA and Swiss
nationals’ below.</p>

<p>Non-EEA nationals need permission to enter Ireland. Whether or not you are
<a shape="rect" href="visa_requirements_for_entering_ireland.html">required to
have a visa</a> to enter Ireland, the same <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP07000022">rules about permission
to enter</a> apply to non-EEA nationals. When you arrive in Ireland, you must
report to an immigration officer. If you are allowed to enter Ireland, the
immigration officer may give you permission to remain in Ireland for up to 3
months – see ‘Non-EEA nationals’ below.</p>

<p><strong>Travel with a child aged under 18:</strong> The Irish Naturalisation
and Immigration Service (INIS) has published advice for people travelling to
Ireland with a <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/travel-with-children">minor who is
not their child or who has a different surname</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Advance Passenger Information:</strong> The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/si/0597.html">European Communities
(Communication of Passenger Data) Regulations 2011</a> requesting airlines to
provide Advance Passenger Information (API) apply to all inbound flights to
Ireland from outside the EU. It is aimed at improving border control and
combating illegal immigration.</p>

<p>If you are an EEA or Swiss national, you may be refused permission to enter
Ireland only if:</p>
<ul><li>You are suffering from a specified disease or disability or </li>
  <li>Your conduct has been such that it would be contrary to public policy or
    would endanger public security </li>
</ul><p>You do not have to register with the immigration authorities as <a shape="rect" href="../rights_of_residence_in_ireland/residence_rights_eu_national.html">EEA

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l28d05">Non-EEA nationals</h2>

<p>If you are a national of any other country, you must get permission to enter
when you arrive in Ireland. </p>

<h3>If you are refused permission to enter</h3>

<p>The immigration officer may refuse for any one of a number of reasons. For
example, permission may be refused if the immigration officer has reason to
believe that:</p>
<ul><li>You are not in a position to support yourself and any dependants arriving
    with you </li>
  <li>You intend to take up employment and you do not have a permit </li>
  <li>You suffer from certain specified conditions - these include TB, other
    infectious diseases, drug addiction and profound mental disturbance (this
    is defined as “manifest conditions of psychotic disturbance with
    agitation, delirium, hallucinations or confusion”) </li>
  <li>You have been convicted of an offence which carries a penalty of a
    year’s imprisonment or more </li>
  <li>You are obliged to have a visa and you do not have one </li>
  <li>You are the subject of a deportation order, an exclusion order or similar
    order </li>
  <li>You do not have a valid passport </li>
  <li>You intend to travel to Great Britain or Northern Ireland and you do not
    have a right to enter there </li>
  <li>Your entry or presence in Ireland could pose a threat to national
    security or be contrary to public policy. </li>
</ul><p>If you are refused permission to enter you must be given the reasons in
writing. </p>

<h3>If you are granted permission to enter</h3>

<p>You may be given permission to enter but with conditions attached. For
example, you may be allowed stay for a stated period only. </p>

<p>The immigration officer may grant you a visitor permission which allows you
to stay for a maximum of 3 months. In certain unforeseen circumstances, this <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Extension%20of%20Visitor%20Permission%20in%20the%20State">visitor
permission may be extended</a>. </p>

<p>If you wish to stay in Ireland for longer than this you must apply for <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/non-eea-permission">permission to
remain by registering with your local immigration office.</a> In Dublin this is
the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/registration-appointment-system">Burgh
Quay Registration Office</a> and outside Dublin it is your regional
registration office or local garda district headquarters – see ‘Where to
apply’ below. You can read more in our document, <a href="../rights_of_residence_in_ireland/registration_of_non_eea_nationals_in_ireland.html">Registration
of non-EEA nationals in Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>However, <a href="visa_requirements_for_entering_ireland.html">visa-required
nationals</a> who have entered Ireland on a C visa cannot extend their
permission to remain. They must leave and apply for a D visa from outside
Ireland if they wish to return.</p>

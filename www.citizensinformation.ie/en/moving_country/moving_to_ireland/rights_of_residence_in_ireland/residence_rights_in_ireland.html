<p><strong>I am a Lithuanian national living and working in Dublin. I went to
the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) to get a residence permit but was
told that I don't need one. Is this true?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, this is correct. EU nationals do not need a residence permit in order
to live and work in Ireland. You can find out more about <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-in-ireland/residence_rights_EU_national" shape="rect">residence rights of EU/EEA nationals</a>.</p>

<p><strong>I am an Irish citizen living in France with my Russian same-sex
partner. I am moving back to Ireland to work. Is it possible for me to bring my
partner to live with me in Ireland?</strong> </p>

<p>Yes and this right is set down in law. Under <span class="link-external"><a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/EU%20Treaty%20Rights" shape="rect">EU Regulations</a></span> if you can establish that you have been
living together as a couple for at least the last 2 years, your partner can
apply to be recognised as a “permitted family member” after you both arrive
in the State. As a citizen of a visa-required country, your partner will need
to apply for a visa before travelling to Ireland. </p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>I am a South African woman, married to a German citizen and working
in Germany at present. Do I have a right to live and work in
Ireland?</strong></p>

<p>Under EU Regulations, you may accompany your husband if he is moving to
Ireland to work. If he is not moving to Ireland, you are not entitled to live
and work here unless you have an <a href="../../../employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/">employment
permit</a>, as you are not a citizen of an EU or EEA member state.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>I am an Irish citizen. If I marry my Chinese girlfriend in China,
can she come to live with me in Ireland?</strong></p>

<p>As a Chinese citizen, your future wife will need a <a href="../coming_to_live_in_ireland/visa_requirements_for_entering_ireland.html">visa</a>
to come to Ireland. She must <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Apply%20for%20a%20visa%20%E2%80%93%20how%20to%20apply">apply
online for a visa</a>. She will have to provide detailed documentation to back
up the application.</p>

<p><strong>I am an Australian married to an Irish citizen and living in Cork.
Can my Australian father come to live with us? He is on an Australian state
pension.</strong> </p>

<p>If your father can show that he can support himself in Ireland and if he has
private health insurance, he may come and live in Ireland with you. </p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>I have been living and working in Ireland on a work permit for the
past 4 years. When can I apply for long-term residence?</strong></p>

<p>If you have worked for 5 consecutive years on a employment permit, <span class="link-external"><a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Policy%20for%205%20year%20workers%20and%20redundant%20workers">you
will no longer need an employment permit</a></span> and you will be given a
stamp 4 permission to remain for a year. You may apply for <span class="link-external"><a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Long_Term_Residency" shape="rect">long-term residency</a></span> which is an extended residence
permission for a further 5 years.</p>

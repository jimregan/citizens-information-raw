<p>People who are citizens of the United Kingdom (UK) are entitled to live in
Ireland without any conditions or restrictions. Unlike the citizens of other
countries, they are not subject to the Aliens Act 1935 or to any orders made
under it. This means that a UK citizen does not need a visa, any form of
residence permit or employment permit in Ireland. They are entitled to move to
Ireland from any country and they may move to Ireland to work or to retire.
Unlike other EU citizens, UK citizens may retire to Ireland without having to
establish that they have sufficient resources or that they have private health
insurance.</p>

<p>In general, while living in Ireland, UK citizens are entitled to avail of
public services on the same basis as Irish citizens living in Ireland. They are
entitled to vote in Irish elections with the exception of Presidential
elections and referendums.</p>

<p>The right of UK citizens to live in Ireland derives from Irish law. UK
citizens also have rights under the <a href="residence_rights_eu_national.html">EU freedom of movement
legislation</a>. These rules do not expand the rights of UK citizens themselves
(since their rights are more extensive than those of other EU citizens) but
they may be relevant for the family members of UK citizens living in Ireland.
<a href="residence_rights_of_family_members.html">Family members of UK
citizens</a> who are not themselves EU citizens may be able to move to Ireland
to live with them.</p>

<p>UK citizens do not need a passport when travelling to Ireland from within
the <a href="../../moving_abroad/freedom_of_movement_within_the_eu/common_travel_area_between_ireland_and_the_uk.html">Common
Travel Area</a>. However they can be asked for photo identification and proof
that they are a UK citizen. They do need a passport if travelling from outside
the Common Travel Area.</p>

<p>The UK government has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/living-in-ireland">short
guide for UK citizens</a> living in Ireland and travelling to Ireland.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Living in Ireland</h3>

<p>UK citizens are entitled to live in Ireland. In general, people who are not
Irish citizens are subject to the Aliens Act 1935 as amended. UK citizens are
not. While resident in Ireland, they are subject to the criminal and civil law
in the same way as all other residents. Among other things, this means that
they may be arrested for crimes allegedly committed in other countries and may
be <a href="../../../justice/arrests/extradition_to_and_from_ireland.html">extradited</a>.</p>

<h3>Entitlement to health services</h3>

<p>UK citizens who are resident in Ireland are <a href="../../../health/entitlement_to_health_services/entitlement_to_public_health_services.html">entitled
to health services</a> in the same way as Irish citizens who are resident. This
means that they may avail of public health services if they are “ordinarily
resident”.</p>

<p>UK citizens resident in Ireland whose income is from a UK source and who do
not have any income from Ireland may be entitled to a <a href="../../../health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical
card</a> regardless of their means. (Under EU rules, if you are getting a
social security pension from another EEA country or Switzerland, or if you are
working and paying social insurance in one of these countries, you may qualify
for a medical card if you are ordinarily resident in Ireland, provided you are
not subject to Irish social security legislation.) </p>

<h3>Entitlement to social welfare payments</h3>

<p>UK citizens living in Ireland are eligible for social welfare payments in
the same way as Irish citizens living in Ireland.</p>

<p>Residence in the Common Travel Area is treated the same way as residence in
Ireland for the purposes of the <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitual
residence condition (HRC)</a>. UK citizens coming from the Common Travel area
have a right to reside in Ireland. However, they still need to meet the
requirements of the HRC (in the same way as Irish citizens living in Ireland)
to qualify for many means-tested social welfare payments.</p>

<p>UK citizens who have recently moved to Ireland may find it more difficult to
establish that their main centre of interest is in Ireland.</p>

<h3>Voting</h3>

<p>UK citizens living in Ireland are entitled to <a href="../introduction_to_the_irish_system/right_to_vote.html">vote</a> in
national, local and European Parliament elections if they meet the other
requirements. They are not entitled to vote in Presidential elections or
referendums.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are not a citizen of the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/eu-eea-countries">European Economic
Area (EEA)</a> or Switzerland, there are various forms of residence rights
(permission to remain) that allow you to live in Ireland. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/non-eea-permission">Permission
to remain</a> in Ireland is granted by the Department of Justice and Equality
and consists of a special stamp endorsed on your passport. This is usually
called a residence stamp. The various types of stamp and their meanings are
covered in our document, <a href="types_residence_permission_non_eea_nationals.html">Types of residence
permission for non-EEA nationals</a>.</p>

<p>If you are granted permission to remain, a Certificate of Registration is
endorsed on your passport - see ‘Certificate of Registration below’
below.</p>

<p>Depending on the circumstances, members of your family may be able to come
to Ireland with you, or to join you when you are here – see ‘Family
members’ below. </p>

<h3>Changes to immigration law</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/enacted/en/html">International
Protection Act 2015,</a> which came into effect on 31 December 2016, provides
for a single application procedure for <a href="../../asylum_seekers_and_refugees/the_asylum_process_in_ireland/refugees_asylum_seekers_introduction.html">international
protection (refugee status and subsidiary protection) and permission to
remain</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>If you are a non-EEA national and intend to come to live in Ireland, there
are several important pieces of documentation that you will need before coming
here. These documents include: </p>
<ul><li><strong>Your passport</strong>: which must be valid for at least the
    duration of your proposed stay </li>
  <li>The <strong>relevant visa</strong>: if you are a <a shape="rect" href="../coming_to_live_in_ireland/visa_requirements_for_entering_ireland.html">citizen
    of a visa-required country</a> </li>
  <li>An <strong>employment permit, business visa or business
    permission</strong>: if you intend to work or engage in business in Ireland
  </li>
</ul><p>An immigration officer will examine your documentation when you present
yourself at the point of entry to Ireland. You may be asked to show evidence
that you have enough funds to support yourself and any dependants for the
duration of your proposed stay. You may also be required to answer other
questions relevant to your application for permission to remain. The onus rests
with you to satisfy the immigration officer as to the genuine reason for your
presence in Ireland. In other words, you must satisfy them that your
credentials are authentic.</p>

<h3>Requirement to produce identity documents</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2011/act/23/section/34/enacted/en/html#sec34">Civil
Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 (section 34)</a> provides that non-EEA
nationals arriving in the State must present a passport or equivalent document
when asked for it by an immigration officer. (Previously, it was not
specifically stated that they had to present it.) It also requires non-EEA
nationals who are present in the State to provide such a document or a
registration certificate on demand to the Minister, an immigration officer or a
Garda, if asked to do so to prove that they comply with their permission to
remain in the State. This requirement does not apply to people under 16 years
of age, but it does now apply to non-EEA nationals who were born in Ireland.</p>

<p>Section 34 does not apply to people who are exercising <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/EU%20Treaty%20Rights">EU Treaty
Rights of free movement</a>. However, anyone seeking to enter or live in the
State on the basis of being an EEA national or a dependant of an EEA national
is still required to provide satisfactory evidence of identity and nationality
to establish that basis.</p>

<h3>Certificate of Registration</h3>

<p>If everything is in order, the immigration officer will place the
appropriate stamp on your passport. If your stay is for longer than 3 months,
you will have to register with the Burgh Quay Registration Office or your local
immigration office who will issue you with a Certificate of Registration (also
known as a GNIB card) - see 'How to apply' below. It is the same size as a
credit card and will show what type of residence stamp you hold.</p>

<p>Depending on your nationality and your legal status in Ireland, this card
may also function as a residence card, or residence document – see below. It
is not an identity document: it is just a certificate that you have <a shape="rect" href="registration_of_non_eea_nationals_in_ireland.html">registered</a> as
required by Irish immigration law. </p>

<p><strong>Change of immigration status:</strong> If you currently have
permission to remain and a valid Certificate of Registration, it is possible to
<a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP07000279">apply to change your
immigration status</a>. </p>

<h3>Family members</h3>

<p>Your right to have family members come to live with you depends on the rules
governing your presence in Ireland. For example, if you have a <a href="../../../employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/work_permits.html">General
Employment Permit</a>, you may be able to bring your family to live here after
you have been legally working here for a year. You must also be able to show
that you can support them without recourse to public funds. In practice, this
means that you have enough money to support them without qualifying for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
Income Supplement (FIS).</a> This payment depends on your income and the number
of dependants you have. </p>

<p>You can read more in our document on <a href="residence_rights_of_family_members.html">residence rights for family
members.</a></p>

<h3>Visitors and others who are not allowed to work</h3>

<p>If you are coming to Ireland as a visitor, a tourist, the spouse, civil
partner or dependant of an employment permit holder, or in order to receive
medical treatment, you will get a <em>stamp number 3</em> on your passport. </p>

<p>If you have a stamp 3 you will not be entitled to work or engage in any
business or profession while in Ireland. The length of time that this stamp is
valid will depend on your circumstances. </p>

<p>Once they are legally resident in the State, spouses, recognised partners,
civil partners and dependants of holders of Critical Skills Employment Permits,
former Green Card permits and researchers can apply for a <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/spousal_work_permit_scheme.html">Dependant/Partner/Spousal
Employment Permit</a>. </p>

<h3>People who are allowed to work</h3>

<p>In general, if you are a non-EEA national you must have an <a href="../../../employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/overview_employment_permits.html">employment
permit</a> to work in Ireland. Certain <a href="../studying_in_ireland/immigration_nonEEA_students.html">non-EEA
students</a> may take up casual work. Also, the following groups of people who
have been granted a <em>stamp 4</em> residence permission do not need
permission to work in Ireland.</p>

<p><strong>EU Treaty Rights</strong></p>

<p>If you are a non-EEA family member granted permission to remain under <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/EU%20Treaty%20Rights">EU Treaty
Rights</a>, when you register with your local immigration registration office,
you will receive your residence card with wording <em>4 EU FAM</em>. As a
holder of the card 4 EU FAM, you will be visa-exempt even if you are a
visa-required national and you do not need an employment permit or business
permission.</p>

<p><strong>Employment permit for 5 years</strong></p>

<p>If you have worked on an employment permit for 5 consecutive years you will
no longer need a permit to work in Ireland. You should apply to your local
immigration officer – see ‘How to apply’ below – who will issue you
with a stamp 4 immigration permission for one year. This permission may be
renewed annually and it will allow you to take up any employment or
self-employment. <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Policy%20for%205%20year%20workers%20and%20redundant%20workers">Further
details about this immigration permission are available on the INIS website.
</a></p>

<p><strong>Other eligible categories</strong></p>

<p>If you are in Ireland as the spouse, civil partner or dependant of an Irish
or other EEA national, or of a Swiss national, you will get <em>a stamp 4,</em>
which means that you will not need an employment permit or business permission.
When you register with the local immigration office, the Certificate of
Registration (GNIB card) that you receive will be a residence document. </p>

<p>You will also get <em>stamp 4</em> if you come under one of the following
categories: Convention or Programme refugees; former asylum seekers granted <a shape="rect" href="../../asylum_seekers_and_refugees/refugee_status_and_leave_to_remain/leave_to_remain.html">permission
to remain</a>. </p>

<p>This stamp also applies if you are on an <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Permit-Types/Intra-Company-Transfer-Employment-Permit/">intra-company
transfer</a>. The length of time that this stamp is valid will depend on your
circumstances. </p>

<h3>Long-term residence rights</h3>

<p>Depending on your circumstances, you can acquire long-term residence rights
if you have been legally resident in Ireland for 5 years or more. You will
still need to register with the Garda authorities and obtain a Certificate of
Registration but you will not need an employment permit. </p>

<p>If you have been here on the basis of employment permit conditions for over
5 years, you may apply for <a shape="rect" href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Long_Term_Residency">long term
residency for a further 5 years.</a> Your spouse or civil partner and
dependants may also apply for long-term residency if they have been legally
resident in Ireland for at least 5 years. If you are successful you will get a
<em>stamp number 4</em> on your passport for 5 years and you will no longer
need a permit to work in Ireland. Your dependants will get a <em>stamp number
3</em> and will still be required to have an employment permit. For further
information contact <a href="mailto:INISLongTermRes@justice.ie">INISLongTermRes@justice.ie</a>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if you have been legally resident for over 8 years (but not as a
student or an asylum-seeker) you may apply for <em>stamp number 5</em> on your
passport, which gives you permission to remain in Ireland "<a shape="rect" href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Without_Condition_As_To_Time_Endorsements">without
condition as to time”.</a> You will be entitled to work or engage in a
business or profession while in Ireland. This stamp lasts until the expiry date
of your passport, and can be renewed when you get a new passport. For further
information contact <a href="mailto:INISStamp5and6@justice.ie">INISStamp5and6@justice.ie</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a <em>stamp 4 EU-FAM</em> on your passport, you may apply for a
permanent residence card after 5 years in the State – see ‘How to apply’
below. If successful you will be issued with a permanent residence card for 5
years.</p>

<p>It is also possible to apply for <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_citizenship/becoming_an_irish_citizen_through_naturalisation.html">Irish
citizenship through naturalisation</a> after you have built up 5 years of
reckonable residence for citizenship purposes. The residence requirements for
citizenship through <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_citizenship/becoming_an_irish_citizen_through_marriage.html">marriage
to or civil partnership with an Irish citizen</a> are more lenient. </p>

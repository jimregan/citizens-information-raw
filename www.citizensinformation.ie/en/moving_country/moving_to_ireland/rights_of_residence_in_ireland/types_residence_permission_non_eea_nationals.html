<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are not a citizen of the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/eu-eea-countries">European Economic
Area (EEA) or Switzerland</a>, there are various types of residence rights or
permission to remain that allow you to live in Ireland. Permission to remain is
granted by the Department of Justice and Equality and consists of a special
stamp endorsed on your passport. This is usually called a residence stamp. The
various types of stamp and their meanings are covered in detail below.</p>

<p>You can read more about the general rules on residence in our document on <a href="residence_rights_of_non_eea_nationals_in_ireland.html">residence
rights for non-EEA nationals</a>. The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration
Service (INIS) also publishes extensive information on its website, <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Home">inis.gov.ie</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l8c91d">General types</h2>

<h3>Employment permit holders</h3>

<p>If you have an <a href="../../../employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/overview_employment_permits.html">employment
permit</a>, you have permission to remain in Ireland for as long as your
employment permit is valid. You will get a <em>stamp number 1</em> on your
passport. This stamp gives you permission to remain on condition that you do
not enter any employment unless you or your employer have obtained an
employment permit.</p>

<h3>Business permission holders</h3>

<p>You will need a business permission if you wish to establish or engage in
business in Ireland. A business permission is granted for 1 year initially. If
you have a business permission, you will also get a <em>stamp number 1</em> on
your passport. This stamp gives you permission to remain for as long as your
business permission is valid. Since 16 March 2016 the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP09000013">business permission
scheme has been suspended</a>.</p>

<h3>Investors and entrepreneurs</h3>

<p>The Immigrant Investor Programme provides <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/New%20Programmes%20for%20Investors%20and%20Entrepreneurs">investment
options ranging from €500,000 to €1 million</a> which allows approved
non-EEA investors and their immediate family enter Ireland on multi-entry visas
and remain here for up to 5 years.</p>

<p>The Start-up Entrepreneur Programme allows <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Minister%20Shatter%20announces%20targeted%20changes%20in%20the%20Start-up%20Entrepreneur%20Programme">non-EEA
participants with an innovative business proposal and funding or financial
backing of at least €50,000</a> to come and set up a business in Ireland.
This scheme does not apply to retail, catering, personal services or similar
businesses – see 'Business permission holders' above.</p>

<p>Successful applicants to both programmes will be granted a residence
permission for 2 years initially. You can read more in our document, <a href="../../../employment/types_of_employment/self_employment/coming_to_set_up_a_business_in_ireland.html">Coming
to set up a business or invest in Ireland</a>.</p>

<h3>Students</h3>

<p>If you are a <a href="../studying_in_ireland/immigration_nonEEA_students.html">non-EEA
national coming to study in Ireland</a> you must be enrolled in a full-time
course on the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Interim%20List%20of%20Eligible%20Programmes%20-%20ILEP">Interim
List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP)</a>. If you are attending a course on the
ILEP you will have <em>stamp number 2</em> endorsed on your passport. You will
be allowed to take up <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Changes%20to%20the%20Employment%20entitlements%20of%20Non-EEA%20Students%20holding%20Immigration%20Stamp%202%20%E2%80%93%20with%20effect%20from%201%20September%202016">casual

40 hours per week during holiday periods (June to September and 15 December to
15 January). If you are not attending a course on the Interim List of Eligible
Programmes, you will not be entitled to take up part-time work or engage in any
business or profession. You will get <em>stamp number 2A</em> on your passport.
</p>

<p><strong>Third Level Graduate Scheme:</strong> Non-EEA students who have
graduated with a degree at level 7 to 10 from an Irish third-level institution
and have a current Certificate of Registration may be permitted to apply for
the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/GraduateScheme.pdf/Files/GraduateScheme.pdf">Third
Level Graduate Scheme (pdf)</a>. This scheme provides an extension of their
permission to remain for 6 or 12 months to allow them to seek employment and
obtain a <a href="../../../employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/green_card_permits.html">Critical
Skills Employment Permit</a> or <a href="../../../employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/work_permits.html">General
Employment Permit</a>. If they are granted permission to remain, <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Introduction%20of%20new%20Stamp%20for%20students%20availing%20of%20the%20Third%20Level%20Graduate%20Scheme%20%E2%80%93%20Stamp%201G">from
1 February 2016 they will get stamp 1G</a>.</p>

<h3>Spouse or civil partner of an Irish national</h3>

<p>If you are a non-EEA national married to, or in a recognised civil
partnership with, an Irish national <strong>you do not have an automatic right
to live in Ireland.</strong> Depending on your current immigration status, you
apply for permission to live in Ireland as follows:</p>
<ul><li>If you <strong>currently have permission</strong> to live in Ireland, you
    should go with your Irish national spouse or civil partner to register with
    <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/contact-registration">your
    local immigration officer</a> as the spouse or civil partner of an Irish
    national.</li>
</ul><p>Or</p>
<ul><li>If you <strong>do not have permission</strong> to live in Ireland, you
    must apply in writing to the Marriage to Irish National Section of the
    Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service – see 'Where to apply'
  below.</li>
</ul><p>You can find <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP07000024">details of the
application procedures for spouses and civil partners of Irish nationals on
inis.gov.ie</a>. Once you have permission to live in Ireland on the basis of
marriage or civil partnership with an Irish national you may get a <em>stamp
4</em> on your passport and you do not need an employment permit or business
permission.</p>

<h3>EU Treaty Rights</h3>

<p>If you are a non-EEA family member of an EEA or Swiss citizen, who meets the
requirements as laid out in the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/si/548/made/en/print">European
Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2015,</a> you must apply to
the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service for permission to remain under
<a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/EU%20Treaty%20Rights">EU Treaty
Rights</a>.</p>

<p>When you <a href="registration_of_non_eea_nationals_in_ireland.html">register with your
local registration office</a> the Certificate of Registration that you receive
will be a residence card with the wording 4 EU FAM (that is, the residence card
of a family member of an EU citizen). As a holder of this card 4 EU FAM, you
will be visa-exempt even if you are a visa-required national and you do not
need an employment permit or business permission.</p>

<h3>De facto relationships</h3>

<p>Non-EEA nationals who are in de facto relationships must have permission to
remain in the State. They can apply for a <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/De%20Facto%20Relationships">de facto
partnership immigration permission (DFPIP)</a> as follows:</p>
<ul><li>A non-EEA national whose partner is an Irish national must provide proof
    of a durable relationship of at least 1 year. If the non-EEA national is
    granted permission to remain they are not required to have an employment
    permit</li>
  <li>If you are a non-EEA national whose partner is an EU national you can
    apply for a <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/EU%20Treaty%20Rights">residence card
    under EU Treaty Rights</a> if you have proof of a durable relationship of
    at least 2 years. If you are granted permission to remain you will not need
    an employment permit.</li>
  <li>A non-EEA national whose partner is also a non-EEA national must provide
    evidence of a durable relationship of at least 1 year and valid permission
    to reside. The non-EEA national partner (the sponsor) must have a <em>stamp
    1, 4 </em>or <em>5</em> residence permission. Non-EEA nationals with
    <em>stamp 2 </em>or <em>3</em> permission are not eligible to be
  sponsors</li>
</ul><p>There is no application form and you should apply in writing in the form of
a letter. You can find the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/De%20Facto%20Relationships%20with%20an%20Irish%20National%20or%20Irish%20Resident%20-%20Guidelines%20for%20applicants">guidelines

asked questions on inis.gov.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>Visitors and others who are not allowed to work</h3>

<p>If you are coming to Ireland as a visitor, a tourist, the spouse, civil
partner or dependant of an employment permit holder, or in order to receive
medical treatment, you will get a <em>stamp number 3</em> on your passport.</p>

<p>If you have a stamp 3 you will not be entitled to work or engage in any
business or profession while in Ireland. The length of time that this stamp is
valid will depend on your circumstances. <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Ministers%20of%20Religion%20and%20Lay%20Volunteers">Guidelines
to the immigration arrangements for ministers of religion and lay volunteers
are on inis.gov.ie</a> For further information contact <a href="mailto:Unit2ResidenceDivision@justice.ie">Unit2ResidenceDivision@justice.ie</a>.</p>

<p>Once they are legally resident in the State, spouses, recognised partners,
civil partners and dependants of holders of Critical Skills Employment Permits,
former Green Card permits and researchers can apply for a <a href="../../../employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/spousal_work_permit_scheme.html">Dependant/Partner/Spousal
Employment Permit</a>.</p>

<h3>Doctors</h3>

<p>All non-EEA doctors registering with their local immigration office on or
after 1 March 2014, whether for the first time or renewing their immigration
permission, must have an employment permit. Their stamp 1 immigration
permission will be for 6 months or 12 months subject to the duration of their
employment contract. Doctors who already have <em>stamp 4</em> can have their
stamp 4 renewed for 2 years. You can read about the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/ARRANGEMENTS%20FOR%20NON-EEA%20DOCTORS%20WORKING%20IN%20THE%20STATE">immigration
arrangements for non-EEA doctors, including locum doctors, on
inis.gov.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>Stamp 0</h3>

<p>The immigration permission stamp 0 is granted to people who are coming to
Ireland for a limited and specific stay. They must be self-sufficient and may
not get State benefits if they have stamp 0 permission. They include:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Visiting academics:</strong> They may work here for less than 9
    months and must be paid from outside the State</li>
  <li><strong>Older dependent relatives:</strong> The financial criteria to
    sponsor an older dependent relative are set out in Chapter 18 of the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Family%20Reunification%20Policy%20Document.pdf/Files/Family%20Reunification%20Policy%20Document.pdf">family
    reunification policy document (pdf)</a></li>

    income of at least €50,000 and access to a lump sum to cover any
    unforeseen large expenses</li>

about the stamp 0 permission</a> is available on inis.gov.ie.</p>

<h3>Parents of Irish citizen children</h3>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP09000196">Irish
Born Child Scheme (IBC/05)</a> a number of non-EEA national parents of children
born in the State prior to 1 January 2005 were granted permission to remain for
an initial period of 2 years. Many of them had their permission to remain
extended subject to certain conditions in 2007, 2010 and 2013.</p>

<p>On 8 March 2011 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in the Zambrano
case <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&amp;Submit=rechercher&amp;numaff=C-34/09">C
34/09</a>, that an EU member state may not refuse the non-EU parents of a
dependent child who is a citizen of, and resident in, an EU member state the
right to live and work in that member state. Non-EEA parents who meet the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP16000113">Zambrano criteria</a>
may be given permission to live and work in Ireland without the requirement for
an employment permit or business permission.</p>

<p>From 1 October 2015, there is a new <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP07000030">application
procedure</a> for non-EEA parents applying for permission to remain based on
parentage of an Irish citizen child.</p>

<h3>Victims of domestic violence</h3>

<p>Some foreign nationals who are victims of domestic violence may currently
have an immigration status which is dependent on the person carrying out the
domestic violence. In these cases the foreign national may apply for
independent immigration status as a victim of domestic violence. You can read
the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Victims%20Of%20Domestic%20Violence%20-%20Note%20for%20Web.pdf/Files/Victims%20Of%20Domestic%20Violence%20-%20Note%20for%20Web.pdf">immigration
guidelines for victims of domestic violence (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Victims of human trafficking</h3>

<p>A non-EEA national who has been identified as a suspected <a href="../../../justice/crime_and_crime_prevention/anti_human_trafficking_initiative.html">victim
of human trafficking</a> may be granted permission to remain in Ireland for up
to 60 days. In certain cases such a non-EEA national may be granted further
periods of temporary residence in Ireland.</p>

<p>The person must have been identified as a suspected victim by a
superintendent or higher-ranked Garda in the Garda National Immigration Bureau
(GNIB). Full details are in <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Administrative%20Immigration%20Arrangements%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Victims%20of%20Human%20Trafficking%20-%20March%202011.pdf/Files/Administrative%20Immigration%20Arrangements%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Victims%20of%20Human%20Trafficking%20-%20March%202011.pdf">Administrative

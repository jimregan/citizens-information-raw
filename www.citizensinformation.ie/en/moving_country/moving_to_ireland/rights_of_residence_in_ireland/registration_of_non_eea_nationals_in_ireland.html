<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are not a citizen of the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/eu-eea-countries">European Economic
Area (EEA)</a> or Switzerland, you need <a href="../coming_to_live_in_ireland/permission_to_land_in_ireland.html">permission
to enter</a> Ireland. If you wish to stay for more than 3 months you must have
<a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/non-eea-permission">permission to
remain</a> and register your presence in Ireland with immigration.</p>

<p>Under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0001/sec0009.html">Section
9 of the Immigration Act 2004</a>, non-EEA nationals must register when staying
here for more than 3 months. In practice, this means that you are obliged <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/about-registration-system">to
register with your local immigration registration officer</a> following your
arrival in Ireland. Registering with immigration officials means appearing in
person before the registration officer and providing certain information and
evidence about your status - see 'How to apply' below.</p>

<p>Any <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP07000279">changes you
wish to make to the length of your stay or status</a> must also be reported to
immigration officials. You must also notify the registration officer if you
plan to move to another Garda District, and report to the registration officer
of that new district within 2 days of arriving to live there. <br></p>

<h3>What is the purpose of registration?</h3>

<p>The purpose of registration of non-EEA nationals is for border control
reasons. The Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) also carries out
deportations, border control and investigations related to illegal immigration
and trafficking in human beings. The GNIB has specialist units dealing in each
area. </p>

<h3>What happens after I register?</h3>

<p>Following registration with immigration officials, you will be issued with a
<em>Certificate of Registration</em>. The Certificate is the size of a credit
card and includes your name, address, photograph and your residence details. It
is often called a <em>GNIB card.</em> </p>

<p><a href="../../asylum_seekers_and_refugees/the_asylum_process_in_ireland/refugees_asylum_seekers_introduction.html">Asylum
seekers</a> receive a different type of certificate – a Temporary Residence
Certificate which is issued by the International Protection Office. </p>

<p>Certificates of Registration are not identity cards. They are, however,
evidence that a person is legally resident in Ireland and you must show
evidence of this, if requested by the Gardaí. </p>

<p>As well as your Certificate of Registration you will also receive a <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/registration-stamps">stamp in your
passport</a> which specifies the duration and the conditions of your permission
to remain in Ireland. The following table gives a list of the different types
of stamp issued to non-EEA nationals:</p>

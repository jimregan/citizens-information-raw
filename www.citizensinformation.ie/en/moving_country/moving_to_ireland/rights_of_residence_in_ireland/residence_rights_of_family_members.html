<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you move to Ireland for whatever reason, you may be able to bring your
family members to live with you. Your rights in this respect depend on your
nationality and on the type of residence entitlement you have. Your family
members’ right to stay in Ireland depends on your entitlement. They may of
course, acquire an entitlement in their own right. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Irish citizens</h3>

<p>A foreign national who marries or enters into a civil partnership with an
Irish citizen does not have an automatic entitlement to live in Ireland. Your
<a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP07000024">spouse or civil
partner</a> is governed by the same rules as apply to all foreign nationals.
You can find a leaflet on <a href="http://www.migrantproject.ie/index.php/returning-to-ireland/residency-information">residency
information for family members and partners of Irish citizens</a> on the
website of Crosscare Migrant Project.</p>

<h3>Other EEA and Swiss citizens</h3>

<p>If you are an <a shape="rect" href="residence_rights_eu_national.html">EEA
or Swiss citizen living in Ireland</a>, then you have the right to bring
certain family members to live with you here even if they are not themselves
EEA or Swiss citizens. The main EU legislation at present is set out in
Regulation No 1612/58 and <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:158:0077:0123:EN:PDF">Directive
2004/38/EC (pdf).</a> The 2004 Directive is implemented in Ireland by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2015/en/si/0548.html">European Communities
(Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2015</a>. You can find more information
about <a shape="rect" href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/EU%20Treaty%20Rights">these EU
Treaty Rights on the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service website</a>.
</p>

<p>Most of the EU law on free movement also applies to citizens of the other
EEA countries – Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. There are agreements with
Switzerland which mean that Swiss nationals are treated in broadly the same way
as EU nationals. </p>

<p><em>Qualifying family members</em> are: </p>
<ul><li>Spouses </li>
  <li>Registered partners if the host member state treats such partnerships as
    equivalent to marriages; in Ireland <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Civil%20Partnership">civil
    partnership is equivalent to marriage for immigration purposes.</a></li>
  <li>Direct descendants who are aged under 21 or are dependants (of the EU
    citizen and the spouse or civil partner) </li>
  <li>Direct ancestors who are dependent. </li>
</ul><p>Other family members who do not have an absolute right may be able to move
to Ireland. The Directive requires member states to facilitate the entry and
residence of: </p>
<ul><li>Family members who are dependants or members of the household of the EU
    citizen or where serious health grounds strictly require the personal care
    of the family member by the EU citizen and </li>
  <li>A partner with whom the EU citizen has a durable relationship. The Irish
    authorities consider applications<strong></strong> for residence cards from
    partners of EU nationals who can establish that the relationship has
    existed for at least 2 years<strong><strong></strong></strong>. </li>
</ul><p>These other dependants or partners who are not <em>qualifying family
members</em> are <em>permitted family members</em>. The immigration authorities
are required to undertake an extensive examination of the personal
circumstances in these cases and must justify any refusal of entry or
residence.</p>

<p>In general, your family members retain the right to live here if you die or
if they cease to be a spouse or civil partner. You are entitled to permanent
residence after 5 years. Your family members have the same entitlement.</p>

<h3>People with international protection</h3>

<p>If you have international protection (refugee status or subsidiary
protection) in Ireland or you are a Programme refugee, you may apply for
members of your family to be given permission to come and live in Ireland. In
general, the Minister for Justice and Equality must grant permission to your
spouse, civil partner and dependent children aged under 18. If you are under
18, permission must be granted to your parents. </p>

<p><strong>Permission to remain</strong></p>

<p>People granted <a href="../../asylum_seekers_and_refugees/refugee_status_and_leave_to_remain/leave_to_remain.html">permission
to remain</a> on humanitarian grounds do not have all of the same rights as
persons granted refugee or subsidiary protection status. They do not have the
right to family reunification but anyone who is entitled to reside and remain
in the State may apply to the Minister to permit family members to join them.
The Minister for Justice and Equality can grant or refuse permission on a
discretionary basis.</p>

<h3>Non-EEA citizens</h3>

<p>If you are from outside the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/eu-eea-countries">EEA</a> or
Switzerland, then your right to have family members come to live with you
depends on the rules governing your presence in Ireland. At present, there is
no legislation governing rights of residence for this group. The description
here is of the current administrative arrangements. It is open to you to apply
to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) for anyone
(including a partner) to be allowed join you in Ireland - see 'How to apply'
below.</p>

<p>Family members are generally spouses, civil partners and children under the
age of 18. It is not the general policy to allow dependants over the age of 18
to join you in Ireland. You may be able to make a case as to why you should be
an exception to this general rule.</p>

<p>Your family members’ right to remain in Ireland depends on your right to
remain. They may of course, become entitled to a right of residence in their
own right, for example, by getting a Critical Skills or General Employment
Permit.</p>

<p><strong>Workers</strong><br>
If you have a <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/green_card_permits.html">Critical
Skills Employment Permit,</a> you may bring your family to live with you in
Ireland immediately. Your spouse, civil partner and dependants may then get <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/spousal_work_permit_scheme.html">Dependant/Partner/Spousal
Employment Permits.</a> </p>

<p>If you have a <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/work_permits.html">General
Employment Permit</a>, you may be able to bring your family to live here after
you have been legally working here for a year. You also have to be able to show
that you will be able to support them. In practice, you need to be earning an
income above the limits for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
Income Supplement</a>. Your spouse, civil partner and dependants aged under 18
may apply for a General Employment Permit once they are legally resident in
Ireland.</p>

<p><strong>Students</strong><br>
It is not the general policy to allow family members to join students who are
in Ireland as students. You may be able to make a case as to why you should be
an exception to this general rule. </p>

<p><strong>Parents of Irish-born children</strong><br>
If you have been granted residence in Ireland under the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP07000030">Irish Born Child
Scheme,</a> it is not the general policy to allow family members to come and
live with you. You may be able to make a case as to why you should be an
exception to this general rule.</p>

<h3>Requirement to produce identity documents</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2011/act/23/section/34/enacted/en/html#sec34">Civil
Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 (section 34)</a> provides that non-EEA
nationals arriving in the State must present a passport or equivalent document
when asked for it by an immigration officer. (Previously, it was not
specifically stated that they had to present it.)</p>

<p>It also requires non-EEA nationals who are present in the State to provide
such a document or a registration certificate on demand to the Minister, an
immigration officer or a Garda, if asked to do so to prove that they comply
with their permission to remain in the State. This requirement does not apply
to people under 16 years of age, but it does now apply to non-EEA nationals who
were born in Ireland.</p>

<p>Section 34 does not apply to people who are exercising <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/EU%20Treaty%20Rights">EU Treaty
Rights of free movement</a>. However, anyone seeking to enter or live in the
State on the basis of being an EEA national or a dependant of an EEA national
is still required to provide satisfactory evidence of identity and nationality
to establish that basis.</p>

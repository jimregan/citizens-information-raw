<p>There are many reasons why you may be coming to Ireland. You may be coming
to work, to set up a business, to study, to join a family member or to retire.
You may be looking for international protection and intend to apply for refugee
status or subsidiary protection. Before you come to Ireland, you need to know
first of all whether or not you are entitled to live here. Your right to live
in Ireland depends mainly on your nationality and what you intend to do when
you come here. </p>

<p>After you have established whether or not you are entitled to come and live
in Ireland, you will need other information about the formalities of living
here. This document is an overview of the main things you need to know if you
are proposing to come to Ireland to live. (It is not designed for short term
visitors, but you may find some relevant information below.)</p>

<h3>Coming to Ireland and permission to enter</h3>

<p>There are some general rules which apply regardless of the reason why you
are coming to Ireland.</p>

(UK) are entitled to live in Ireland without any conditions or restrictions.

or self-employed you are obliged to pay <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">PRSI
contributions</a> in the same way as Irish people. If you are resident in

<p><strong>Housing: </strong>You are likely to find that <a shape="rect" href="introduction_to_the_irish_system/accommodation.html">housing</a> is

benefits from your home country while you are in Ireland and you may combine
social insurance contributions paid in 2 or more countries to help you qualify

Irish citizens.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Bilateral-Social-Security-Agreements-with-Other-Countries.aspx">bilateral

<p>If you intend to come to work in Ireland you need to know the rules about
the formalities involved in travelling to Ireland, the rules about <a shape="rect" href="../coming_to_live_in_ireland/permission_to_land_in_ireland.html">permission
to land</a> in Ireland. It would be helpful to know general information about
who is entitled to come to Ireland and about living in Ireland <a shape="rect" href="../before_you_come_to_ireland.html">before you come here</a>.</p>

<h3>Finding a job </h3>

<p>You may find out about job vacancies and how to begin the process of <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/migrant_workers/finding_a_job_when_you_move_to_ireland.html">finding
a job in Ireland.</a> </p>

<h3>Visas</h3>

<p>Citizens of certain countries need a <a shape="rect" href="../coming_to_live_in_ireland/visa_requirements_for_entering_ireland.html">visa
in order to come to Ireland</a>. You must <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Apply%20for%20a%20visa%20%E2%80%93%20how%20to%20apply">apply
for an Irish visa online</a>. A visa does not confer any right to live or work
in Ireland.</p>

<h3>Right to work </h3>

<p><strong>EEA and Swiss citizens</strong></p>

<p><strong></strong>If you are from an <a shape="rect" href="../rights_of_residence_in_ireland/residence_rights_eu_national.html">EU
member state or one of the countries of the EEA or Switzerland</a>, you are
entitled to come to work in Ireland. You do not need an employment permit. You
are entitled to have your dependants come to live with you. If your non-EEA
spouse or civil partner is coming to live in Ireland with you, they must apply
for permission to remain under <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/EU%20Treaty%20Rights">EU Treaty
Rights</a> in order to have similar rights to live and work in Ireland.</p>

<p>If you are an EEA or Swiss national, you are entitled to be treated in the
same way as Irish citizens when you apply for work in Ireland. You are free to
apply for any job vacancy, including jobs in the public sector. These include
jobs in the <a href="http://www.military.ie/en/home/">Irish army</a> and the
Irish police force <a shape="rect" href="http://www.garda.ie/">(An Garda
Síochána),</a> but not the Irish diplomatic service. </p>

<p>There is a system of <a href="http://www.qqi.ie/Articles/Pages/Qualifications-Recognition.aspx">mutual
recognition of qualifications</a> between the EEA countries.</p>

<p><strong>Other countries</strong></p>

<p><strong></strong> If you are from another country then generally you need an
<a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/">employment permit</a>.
There are 9 different employment permits – see ‘Employment permits’
below.</p>

<p><strong>Highly Skilled Job Interview Authorisation:</strong> Non-EEA
nationals who have been invited to attend an interview for employment on the <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Highly-Skilled-Eligible-Occupations-List/">Highly
Skilled Occupations list</a>, will be granted a <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Highly-Skilled-Job-Interview-Authorisation/">Highly
Skilled Job Interview Authorisation</a> allowing them to remain Ireland for a
maximum of 90 days.</p>

<h3>Who does not need an employment permit?</h3>

<p>You do not need an employment permit in order to work legally in Ireland if
you are in one of the following categories:</p>
<ul><li>Citizens of the <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Who-needs-an-Employment-Permit-/European-Economic-Area-EEA-/">EEA
    member states</a> and Switzerland, and their spouses, civil partners and
    dependants (regardless of their nationality) </li>
  <li>People who have been granted <a shape="rect" href="../../asylum_seekers_and_refugees/refugee_status_and_leave_to_remain/rights_of_convention_programme_refugees_people_given_leave_to_remain.html">refugee
    status</a> in Ireland </li>
  <li>People who have been refused refugee status but have been given <a shape="rect" href="../../asylum_seekers_and_refugees/refugee_status_and_leave_to_remain/leave_to_remain.html">permission
    to remain on humanitarian grounds</a> </li>
  <li>People who have been given permission to remain because they are the
    spouse, civil partner or parent of an Irish citizen </li>
  <li>Postgraduate students where the work is an integral part of the course of
    study being undertaken </li>
  <li>Non-EEA nationals <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Researchers">carrying out
    scientific research for an approved research organisation</a> </li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP13000007">Van der
    Elst process</a> generally allows a non-EEA national, legally employed by a
    company in an EU country, to provide services on a temporary basis to a
    company in another EU country on behalf of his/her employer without the
    need to obtain an employment permit.</li>
  <li>The <a href="../../../employment/migrant_workers/atypical_work_scheme.html">Atypical
    Working Scheme</a> allows eligible non-EEA nationals to do certain
    short-term contract work in Ireland.</li>
</ul><h3>Students</h3>

<p>If you are from a country whose nationals normally require an employment
permit and <a href="../studying_in_ireland/immigration_nonEEA_students.html">you are
studying in Ireland on an approved course,</a> you may take up casual work –
a maximum of 20 hours a week in term time and full time during the holidays –
without an employment permit. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/GraduateScheme.pdf/Files/GraduateScheme.pdf">Third
Level Graduate Scheme (pdf)</a> allows non-EEA students who have graduated on
or after 1 January 2007 with a level 7 degree to remain in Ireland for 6
months. Those with a degree at levels 8-10 can remain for 12 months. This
allows them to find employment and apply for a General or Critical Skills
Employment Permit.</p>

<h3>Working holiday authorisations<br></h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="https://www.dfa.ie/travel/visas/working-holiday-visas/">Working holiday
authorisations</a> may be issued to nationals of Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, Japan, Argentina, Chile, Hong Kong, USA, Taiwan and South Korea as
part of a reciprocal agreement between these countries and Ireland. If you are
on a working holiday authorisation you are not permitted to transfer over to a
General Employment Permit.</p>

<h3>Employment permits</h3>

<p>There are general rules which apply to all employment permits. Since 1
October 2014, there are <a href="../../../employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/overview_employment_permits.html">9
types of employment permit.</a> They include the <a href="../../../employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/green_card_permits.html">Critical
Skills Employment Permit</a> for highly skilled workers and the <a href="../../../employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/work_permits.html">General
Employment Permit</a> which have replaced the work permit and Green Card permit
respectively. Either the prospective employee or prospective employer may apply
for the permit – see 'How to apply' below.</p>

<p><strong>Refusal of employment permit:</strong> If you are refused an
employment permit, you may ask for an internal review. You should ask for a
review within 21 days of being notified of a refusal.</p>

<p><strong>Employers </strong>who want to employ people who need employment
permits have to meet certain requirements. They must be legally trading in
Ireland – this means they must be registered with Revenue and with the
Companies Registration Office (CRO) if the employer is a company. You can check
the registration at the CRO at <a shape="rect" href="http://www.cro.ie/search/">cro.ie</a></p>

<p>The employer must employ you directly – this means that applications from
recruitment agencies, agents, intermediaries or companies who intend to
outsource or subcontract you to work in another company are not accepted. </p>

<p>Employees who have employment permits are obliged to abide by the
immigration rules. This means that you may need a visa in order to come here
and you must <a shape="rect" href="../rights_of_residence_in_ireland/registration_of_non_eea_nationals_in_ireland.html">register
with the immigration authorities</a>. </p>

<h3>Family reunification</h3>

<p>Your right to have your family come and live with you in Ireland depends on
the type of permit you have. You can find out about the <a shape="rect" href="../rights_of_residence_in_ireland/residence_rights_of_family_members.html">residence
rights of family members</a>.</p>

<h3>Protection for migrant workers</h3>

<p>Foreign nationals who are legally working in Ireland have exactly the same
<a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/">rights
under employment legislation</a> as Irish working here.</p>

<p>The new employment permit is given to the employee. The permit contains a
statement of the rights and entitlements of the worker. The statement of rights
includes the information about when and how the worker may change employment.
The statement also includes details of pay, rights under the <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/pay_inc_min_wage.html">national
minimum wage legislation</a> and any deductions which it is proposed to make
from that pay – for example, for accommodation. The national minimum wage
legislation allows for certain deductions to be made from the statutory minimum
pay of an employee if the employee is provided with board and/or lodgings. </p>

<p>Employers are not allowed to deduct expenses associated with recruitment
from the employee's pay and are not allowed retain any of the worker’s
personal documents. </p>

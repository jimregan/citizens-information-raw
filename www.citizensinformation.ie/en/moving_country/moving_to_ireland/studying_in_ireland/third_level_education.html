<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are moving to Ireland in order to study or if you wish to enrol a
child into a third-level college, you will need to explore the full range of
options available to you. </p>

<p>The third-level education sector in Ireland consists of universities,
institutes of technology, and colleges of education - collectively known as
higher education institutions or HEIs. Third-level qualifications are Levels
6-10 in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nfq.ie/nfq/en/about_NFQ/framework_levels_award_types.html">National
Framework of Qualifications (NFQ).</a> The Framework is a <a href="http://www.nfq-qqi.com/index.html">system of 10 levels</a> which allows
national and international educational qualifications to be compared. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.qqi.ie/">Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI)</a>
has taken over the functions of the following 4 bodies: National Qualifications
Authority of Ireland (NQAI), Further Education and Training Awards Council
(FETAC), Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC) and Irish
Universities Quality Board (IUQB). Education providers can apply to QQI for an
<a href="http://www.qqi.ie/Articles/Pages/International-Education-Mark-(IEM).aspx">International
Education Mark</a> based on their compliance with the <a href="http://www.qqi.ie/Downloads/Code%20of%20Practice.pdf#search=Code%20of%20Practice%20for%20the%20Providers%20of%20Programmes%20of%20Education%20and%20Training%20to%20International%20Learners%20%2A">Code
of Practice for the Providers of Programmes of Education and Training to
International Learners (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3><a>Universities </a></h3>

<p>Universities in Ireland are State-funded, but they are generally autonomous.
University students qualify with Ordinary Bachelors degrees (NFQ Level 7) or
Honors Bachelors degrees (NFQ Level 8). You can choose from 4 universities that
include:</p>
<ul><li>The National University of Ireland (NUI), which is the umbrella
    university covering <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ucd.ie">University
    College Dublin</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ucg.ie">NUI
    Galway</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ucc.ie">University College
    Cork</a>, and <a shape="rect" href="http://www.may.ie">St. Patrick's
    College in Maynooth</a>. The NUI also has recognised colleges including the
    <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ncad.ie">National College of Art and
    Design</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.rcsi.ie">Royal College
    of Surgeons</a> </li>
  <li>The University of Dublin, which is generally known as <a shape="rect" href="http://www.tcd.ie">Trinity College Dublin</a> </li>
  <li>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ul.ie">University of Limerick</a>
  </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.dcu.ie">Dublin City University</a> </li>
</ul><h3>Institutes of technology</h3>

<p>There are 14 institutes of technology located around the country. In the
Dublin area they are <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dit.ie">Dublin</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.it-tallaght.ie/">Tallaght</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.itb.ie/">Blanchardstown</a> and <a shape="rect" href="http://www.iadt.ie">Dun Laoghaire</a>. Around the country they are in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.cit.ie">Cork</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.wit.ie">Waterford</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ittralee.ie">Tralee</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dkit.ie">Dundalk</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ait.ie">Athlone</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.gmit.ie">Galway and Mayo</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.itsligo.ie">Sligo</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.lyit.ie">Letterkenny</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.lit.ie/">Limerick</a>, and <a shape="rect" href="http://www.itcarlow.ie">Carlow</a>. These colleges run courses in
Engineering, Computing, Science, Business, Catering and a wide range of other
areas. Students generally qualify with Higher Certificates (NFQ Level 6) or
Ordinary Bachelors degrees (NFQ Level 7). Honours Bachelors degrees (NFQ Level
8) are also available. </p>

<h3>Colleges of education</h3>

<p>There are several colleges of education providing specialised training for
primary school teachers. </p>

<h3>Private colleges</h3>

<p>In addition to the State-funded colleges, there are a number of fee-paying
third-level educational institutions offering courses, mainly in professional
vocational training and business. Some of these colleges are linked to
universities or professional associations and their qualifications may be
accredited accordingly. Others offer <a href="http://qsearch.qqi.ie/WebPart/Search?searchtype=awards">Quality and
Qualifications Ireland</a> accreditation. It is important to check out the
accreditation on offer before you choose your course. </p>

<h3>Picking a course </h3>

<p>The Central Applications Office (CAO), which is based in Galway, operates a
centralised applications procedure for all third-level colleges. The CAO
website has a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.cao.ie/courses.php">listing of
all of the third-level courses</a> on offer through their system. You can also
check the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.qualifax.ie/?Mainsec=courses&amp;Subsec=search_courses">Qualifax
website for lists of higher education courses.</a> If you have identified some
courses that are of particular interest, you can obtain more detailed
information about them from the relevant colleges. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lb90e8">Rules </h2>

<h3>The points system</h3>

<p>Entrance to third-level education in Ireland is generally decided by
competition. At the end of their secondary school education, students sit the
<a shape="rect" href="/en/education/state_examinations/established_leaving_certificate.html">Leaving
Certificate exam</a> and their grades are converted into numerical points based
on scores in their 6 best subjects. These points are calculated and third-level
places are awarded on that basis. You can find more information in our document
on <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/third_level_education/applying_to_college/application_procedures_and_entry_requirements.html">applications
procedures and entry requirements</a>. </p>

<h3>Recognition of qualifications from other countries</h3>

<p>If you have taken your secondary school exams under another system in
another country, you will need to check whether your qualifications will be
sufficient to secure a place in the Irish third-level course of your choice.
You can do this through the <a href="http://qsearch.qqi.ie/WebPart/Search?searchtype=recognitions">Qualifications
Recognition Service</a>. You should then contact the college directly to
confirm this before making your application.</p>

<h3>English language requirements</h3>

<p>English is the language of instruction at all third-level colleges in
Ireland (some colleges also instruct in the Irish language) so you will need to
show that you are proficient in the language before you will be accepted on a
course. Collegesâ€™ requirements differ but generally they look for an
acceptable English language proficiency test, for example the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ets.org/toefl/">TOEFL</a> or equivalent. You may be able to
take English courses at the college of your choice, but if these are not
available there are a number of private English language colleges around the
country.</p>

<h3>Mature students</h3>

<p>A small number of places are retained for <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/third_level_education/applying_to_college/third_level_courses_for_mature_students.html">mature
students</a>, those over the age of 23. These places are designed to improve
access to third-level for adults who may not have sufficient points from their
Leaving Certificate to compete with school-leavers. If you are interested in
applying for one of these places, you should first contact the college of your
choice. Some colleges require you to apply through the Central Applications
Office and you must apply before 1 February of the year you start your
course.</p>

<p>There are a number of part-time and modular courses and distance education
options available if the full-time education option does not suit your
circumstances.</p>

<h3>Student visas and permission to remain</h3>

<p><strong>Non-EEA students</strong></p>

<p>Non-EEA nationals coming to study in Ireland must be enrolled in an eligible
full-time course listed on the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Interim%20List%20of%20Eligible%20Programmes%20-%20ILEP">Interim
List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP)</a> for student immigration purposes. You
can find out more in our document on <a href="immigration_nonEEA_students.html">the immigration rules for non-EEA
students.</a></p>

<p>If you are travelling from a country that requires a visa to enter Ireland,
you need to apply for a <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/travel_to_ireland/student_visas.html">student
visa</a>. If you are not required to have a visa to enter Ireland, you do not
need a student visa to study in Ireland but you should have your letter of
offer of a place at the school, or educational institution and your other
documentation ready for inspection at immigration. </p>

<p>All non-EEA students must <a shape="rect" href="../rights_of_residence_in_ireland/registration_of_non_eea_nationals_in_ireland.html">register
with their local immigration officer to get permission to remain in
Ireland.</a> The website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service
(INIS) has details of what evidence is required. Non-EEA students coming to
Ireland for the first time may not get permission to remain in Ireland if they
have their children with them, or intend their children to join them later on.
<a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Transitional%20Arrangements%20regarding%20the%20placement%20in%20schools%20of%20non-EEA%20Children%20not%20accompanied%20by%20parents%20and%20of%20children%20.pdf/Files/Transitional%20Arrangements%20regarding%20the%20placement%20in%20schools%20of%20non-EEA%20Children%20not%20accompanied%20by%20parents%20and%20of%20children%20.pdf">There
is more information about the children of non-EEA students on the INIS website
(pdf).</a></p>

<p><strong>EEA students</strong></p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../rights_of_residence_in_ireland/residence_rights_eu_national.html">Students
from the EU/EEA and Switzerland</a> do not need a student visa nor do they
require permission to remain in Ireland.</p>

<h3>Third level graduate scheme</h3>

<p>Non-EEA students who have graduated with a Level 7 degree may be permitted
to remain in Ireland for 6 months. Those with a degree at level 8, 9 or 10 may
be allowed to remain for 12 months. The <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/GraduateScheme.pdf/Files/GraduateScheme.pdf">Third
Level Graduate Scheme (pdf)</a> allows them to find employment and apply for a
<a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/work_permits.html">General
Employment Permit</a> or <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/green_card_permits.html">Critical
Skills Employment Permit.</a> They must be legally resident in Ireland. Under
the scheme, they should apply to their local immigration registration office
and, if they are granted permission to remain, <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Introduction%20of%20new%20Stamp%20for%20students%20availing%20of%20the%20Third%20Level%20Graduate%20Scheme%20%E2%80%93%20Stamp%201G">from
1 February 2016 they will get stamp 1G</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Each higher education institution sets its own tuition fee rates. In general
they also charge a separate student contribution. You should contact the ones
you are interested in to find out what they require. You can find a <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Learners/Information/Providers-of-Higher-Education/List.html">list
of higher education institutions on the website of the Department of Education
and Skills.</a></p>

<p><strong>Free fees:</strong> If you are an EEA or Swiss national and you have
been normally resident in the EEA or Switzerland for at least 3 of the 5 years
before beginning third-level education, you will not be charged fees for
approved full-time undergraduate courses in State-funded universities and
institutes of technology. Other people such as those with refugee status may
also be eligible for free fees. You may be eligible for <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/third_level_education/fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/maintenance_grant_schemes_for_students_on_third_level_courses.html">a
maintenance grant</a>. Funding is not awarded where students already hold an
undergraduate degree or are repeating a year.</p>

<p><strong>EU fees:</strong> If you are an EEA or Swiss national who is not
eligible for free fees or if you have been tax resident in the EEA or
Switzerland for a number of years you may be eligible to pay fees at EU
rates.</p>

<p><strong>Non-EU fees:</strong> If you are applying for a place at third level
as an overseas student and you are not eligible for free fees or EU fee rates,
you will be charged full tuition fees and you will not be eligible for a
maintenance grant.</p>

<p>If you choose to enrol in a private college, you will have to pay fees.
These vary from college to college. </p>

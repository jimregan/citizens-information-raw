<p>Non-EEA nationals coming to study in Ireland must be enrolled in an eligible
full-time course. There have been several changes to the immigration rules for
non-EEA students in 2015 and 2016 – see below. A list of <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Frequently%20Asked%20Questions%20-%20Students">frequently
asked questions</a> for non-EEA students is available on the website of the
Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Home">inis.gov.ie</a>.</p>

<p>Students who are from a country that <a href="../coming_to_live_in_ireland/visa_requirements_for_entering_ireland.html">requires
a visa to enter Ireland</a>, must apply for a student visa. Their visa
application must include evidence that they have access to €7,000 when they
come to Ireland.</p>

<p>All non-EEA students, including those who do not require a visa, must <a href="../rights_of_residence_in_ireland/registration_of_non_eea_nationals_in_ireland.html">register
with their local immigration officer</a> to get permission to remain in Ireland
for more than 90 days. <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Notice%20Regarding%20Evidence%20of%20Finances%20for%20all%20Non%20EEA%20Students">Students
who do not require a visa must have €3,000</a> when they first register with
their local immigration officer, if they are coming to study for more than 6
months.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lb90e8">Rules </h2>

<p>Non-EEA nationals coming to study in Ireland must be enrolled in a full-time
course in one of the following categories. They are not allowed to come to
Ireland to do a part-time or distance learning course.</p>

<h3>Higher education programmes</h3>

<p>Since 1 June 2015, non-EEA nationals can enrol in an eligible course at
level 6 or above on the <a href="http://www.qqi.ie/Pages/National-Framework-of-Qualifications-%28NFQ%29.aspx">National
Framework of Qualifications (NFQ)</a>. Eligible courses are listed on the
updated <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Interim%20List%20of%20Eligible%20Programmes%20-%20ILEP">Interim
List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP)</a>. The maximum time they can study in
Ireland at this level is 7 years. There are exceptions to this limit for
students doing a Ph.D or a course such as medicine and for students in special
circumstances such as illness.</p>

<p>Students must have a certain standard of English. They must also prove that
they are progressing in the course, for example, passing exams. INIS has
published <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Guidelines%20for%20Degree%20Programme%20Students.pdf/Files/Guidelines%20for%20Degree%20Programme%20Students.pdf">Guidelines
for Degree Programme Students (pdf)</a>, listing immigration requirements for
students on higher education programmes, including the requirement to have <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Private%20Medical%20Insurance%20for%20full%20time%20Non-EEA%20Students.pdf/Files/Private%20Medical%20Insurance%20for%20full%20time%20Non-EEA%20Students.pdf">medical
insurance (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Third Level Graduate Scheme:</strong> When they graduate, students
may get an extension of their permission to remain in Ireland under the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/GraduateScheme.pdf/Files/GraduateScheme.pdf">Third
Level Graduate Scheme (pdf)</a>. The scheme allows them to find employment and
apply for a <a href="../../../employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/work_permits.html">General
Employment Permit</a> or <a href="../../../employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/green_card_permits.html">Critical
Skills Employment Permit</a>. Graduates with a level 7 qualification may get a
6-month extension to their residence permission. Graduates with qualifications
at levels 8-10 may get a 12-month extension to their permission. If they are
granted permission to remain, <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Introduction%20of%20new%20Stamp%20for%20students%20availing%20of%20the%20Third%20Level%20Graduate%20Scheme%20%E2%80%93%20Stamp%201G">from
1 February 2016 they will get stamp 1G</a>.</p>

<h3>English-language programmes </h3>

<p>Since 20 January 2016, eligible English-language courses are listed in the
updated <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Interim%20List%20of%20Eligible%20Programmes%20-%20ILEP">Interim
List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP)</a>. Further education programmes and
overseas-accredited vocational education and training programmes are no longer
listed as eligible courses and the Internationalisation Register has ceased to
exist.</p>

<p>The immigration permission to attend a 25-week English-language course is
for 8 months (was 12 months). This applies to first-time and renewal
registrations with effect from 21 January 2016. Existing permissions are not
affected. New students attending language courses may be granted permission for
a maximum of 3 language courses. This amounts to a total immigration permission
of 2 years (3 x 8 months).</p>

<p>INIS has published an <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/I%20want%20to%20study%20a%20language%20course">overview
of conditions for language programme students</a> listing immigration
requirements for such students.</p>

<h3>Students registered before 1 January 2011</h3>

<p>There are specific <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Guidelines%20for%20Non-EEA%20Students%20Registered%20in%20Ireland%20before%201%20January%202011.pdf/Files/Guidelines%20for%20Non-EEA%20Students%20Registered%20in%20Ireland%20before%201%20January%202011.pdf">arrangements
for non-EEA students who were registered in Ireland before 1 January 2011
(pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Timed out students</h3>

<p><strong>Probationary extension:</strong> From 28 August 2012 to 26 February
2013 certain non-EEA national students resident in Ireland since before 1
January 2005 were granted a special Student Probationary Extension. They got a
stamp 2 permission for 2 years followed by a temporary six-month Stamp 4
permission. Then, after an application procedure, eligible students were
granted a <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Frequently%20Asked%20Questions%20-%20Students#Q31">stamp
4 permission to remain in Ireland</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l5536f">Other conditions</h2>

<h3>Changing course</h3>

<p>Students may not change course during the first year of study. After that
they may be allowed to change to another course, provided it is at the same or
a higher level. They may not change from a full-time to a part-time course.</p>

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>Non-EEA students with Stamp 2 permission to remain are allowed to take up
casual employment. They can work up to 20 hours a week during term time and up
to 40 hours a week in the holidays. Holiday periods have been standardised –
June to September inclusive and from 15 December to 15 January. Since 1
September 2016 there are <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Changes%20to%20the%20Employment%20entitlements%20of%20Non-EEA%20Students%20holding%20Immigration%20Stamp%202%20%E2%80%93%20with%20effect%20from%201%20September%202016">changes
to the rules allowing non-EEA students to work</a>.</p>

<p>Students with stamp 2A permission are not allowed to work. </p>

<h3>Social welfare</h3>

<p>Non-EEA students are not entitled to social welfare payments. One of the
conditions of their residence permission is that they have enough money to
support themselves and live in Ireland without claiming State benefits.</p>

<h3>Family reunification</h3>

<p>As a general rule non-EEA students coming to Ireland have no right to bring
their family with them. Spouses, partners and children of non-EEA nationals can
apply to enter and live in Ireland in their own right, but they cannot apply on
the basis of their relationship to a non-EEA student. There are some exceptions
to this rule, for example, for Ph.D. students or for students who can prove
they have sufficient funds to support their family.</p>

<p>In addition <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Transitional%20Arrangements%20regarding%20the%20placement%20in%20schools%20of%20non-EEA%20Children%20not%20accompanied%20by%20parents%20and%20of%20children%20.pdf/Files/Transitional%20Arrangements%20regarding%20the%20placement%20in%20schools%20of%20non-EEA%20Children%20not%20accompanied%20by%20parents%20and%20of%20children%20.pdf">there
are transitional arrangements for the children of non-EEA students who were
already in Ireland on 1 January 2011 (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Short-stay language courses and semesters</h3>

<p>There are special arrangements for <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Notice%20regarding%20Short%20Term%20Language%20Students.pdf/Files/Notice%20regarding%20Short%20Term%20Language%20Students.pdf">non-EEA
students coming to Ireland to do a short English language course (pdf)</a>. The
course must be for less than 90 days. There are also specific immigration
requirements for <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Guidelines%20for%20non-EEA%20Students%20coming%20to%20Ireland%20to%20study%20for%20a%20Semester.pdf/Files/Guidelines%20for%20non-EEA%20Students%20coming%20to%20Ireland%20to%20study%20for%20a%20Semester.pdf">non-EEA

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Whether you are a parent, a student or an adult wishing to return to
education, it is useful for you to become familiar with the <a shape="rect" href="../../../education/the_irish_education_system/overview_of_the_irish_education_system.html">Irish
education system</a>. Whatever area of education you wish to pursue for
yourself or for your child, it is important to find out as much as possible
about the options that are open to you. On the Department of Education and
Skills website you can find information about <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/The-Education-System/">education in
Ireland</a> and a <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Information/A-Guide-to-the-Irish-Education-System.pdf">guide
for parents to the Irish education system (pdf)</a>. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="/en/education/pre_school_education_and_childcare/">Pre-school education</a>
is usually provided by privately funded childcare facilities or providers. The
<a href="../../../education/pre_school_education_and_childcare/early_childhood_care_and_education_scheme.html">Early
Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme</a> provides early childhood care
and education for children of pre-school age. </p>

<p>At <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/">primary and post-primary
level</a>, there are different types of schools including multi-denominational
and co-educational schools. You can also choose from schools that teach the
curriculum through Irish (Gaelscoileanna). You can read more information in our
documents, <a shape="rect" href="../introduction_to_the_irish_system/moving_your_child_irish_primary_school.html">Moving
your child to an Irish primary school</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../introduction_to_the_irish_system/moving_your_child_irish_secondary_school.html">Moving
your child to an Irish secondary school</a>.</p>

<p>If you are <a shape="rect" href="third_level_education.html">moving to
Ireland for third-level education</a>, there is a range of third-level options;
universities, institutes of technologies and the colleges of education are
substantially funded by the State. In addition there are a number of
independent private colleges.</p>

<p>Further education comprises education and training which takes place after
second-level schooling but which is not part of the third-level system. It
includes programmes such as <a href="../../../education/vocational_education_and_training/post_leaving_certificate_courses.html">Post-Leaving
Certificate courses;</a> the <a href="../../../education/returning_to_education/vocational_training_opportunities_scheme.html">Vocational
Training Opportunities Scheme</a> (second-chance education for the unemployed);
programmes in <a href="../../../education/vocational_education_and_training/youthreach.html">Youthreach</a>
for early school-leavers; other literacy and basic education; and self-funded
evening adult programmes in second-level schools. There are opportunities for
adults who wish to <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/returning_to_education/">return to education</a> or <a href="../../../education/vocational_education_and_training/continuing_education_and_training.html">continue
their education</a> on a full-time or part-time basis.</p>

<h3>Fees</h3>

<p>State-funded education is available at primary and post-primary levels, so
you will not have to pay fees unless you choose to send your child to a private
school. Pre-schools are generally run on a private and fee-paying basis, though
there may be some State help in certain circumstances. You will have to pay <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/third_level_education/fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/fees.html">fees
for third-level education</a> unless you qualify for "free fees".</p>

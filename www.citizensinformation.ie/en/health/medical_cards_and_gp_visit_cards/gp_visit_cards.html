<p>If you do not qualify for a <a shape="rect" href="medical_card.html">medical
card</a> you may be eligible for a GP visit card. A GP visit card allows you to
visit a participating family doctor for free.</p>

<p>Unless you have a medical card or a GP visit card, visits to GPs are not
free. In order to qualify for a GP visit card, you must meet the eligibility
rules below and be ordinarily resident in Ireland. That is, you must have been,
or intend to be, living in Ireland for at least one year. You can <a shape="rect" href="entitlement_to_public_health_services.html">read more about
entitlement to public health services here</a>.</p>

<p>If you are aged under 70, you must also meet specific income guidelines.</p>

<p>If you are aged over 70, the GP visit card is available without an income
test.</p>

<p>The <a href="gp_visit_cards_for_under_6s.html">GP visit card for children
under 6</a> is available to all children under the age of 6. </p>

<p>Having a GP visit card only allows you to visit your GP for free. Prescribed
drugs are not free but may be covered by the <a shape="rect" href="drugs_payment_scheme.html">Drugs Payment Scheme</a>. The GP visit card
does not cover <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/hospital_services/hospital_charges.html">hospital
charges</a>. It does cover visits to <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/outofhours/GPOOH.html">GP out of
hours services</a>. Blood tests to diagnose or monitor a condition are covered.

<p>The <a href="gp_visit_cards_for_under_6s.html">GP visit card for children
under 6</a> is available to all children under the age of 6.</p>

<p><strong>The GP visit card is available to everyone aged over 70 without an
income test.</strong></p>

<p>If you are under 70, eligibility for the GP visit card is means tested. That
is, your income is assessed by the HSE as part of the application process.</p>

<h3>Income limits for people aged under 70</h3>

<p>The <strong>rules for assessing the amount of your income</strong> are the
same as for the <a href="medical_card_means_test_under_70s.html">medical
card means test for people aged under 70</a> but the income limits for the GP
visit card are higher than the limits for the medical card. </p>

    </tr></tbody></table><p>There are also allowances for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of
childcare costs and rent/mortgage payments. </p>

<p>Allowances for weekly travel costs to work are assessed as the actual cost
of public transport or, if a car is required, as mileage at 30 cent per mile
(18 cent per km). Where a couple needs two cars to travel to work, a double
allowance applies. The cost of parking can be taken into account.</p>

<h3>Dependants of people aged over 70</h3>

<p>If you are aged over 70 and you have dependants, for example a spouse, civil
partner or cohabiting partner aged under 70, your dependants may qualify for a
GP visit card if your income is below a certain level. The rules for assessing
the amount of your income are the same as for the medical card means test for
people aged under 70 but the income limits for the GP visit card are higher
than the limits for the medical card.</p>

<p>If you have a spouse, civil partner or cohabiting partner, the limit for
your combined income is €1,400 per week, not including the first €72,000 of
savings or similar investments.</p>

<p>If you do not have a spouse, civil partner or cohabiting partner, the income
limit is €700 per week, not including the first €36,000 of savings or
similar investments.</p>

<h3>Income over the limit</h3>

<p>When you apply for a GP visit card you will first be assessed for
eligibility for a medical card. If your income is over the relevant limit, the
deciding officer will consider whether it would cause you undue hardship if you
are refused a medical card.</p>

<p>If you don’t qualify for a medical card you are then assessed for a GP
visit card. If your income is over the relevant limit, the deciding officer
will consider whether it would be 'unduly burdensome' for you to pay for GP
Services if you don’t have a GP visit card.</p>

<h3>Appeals</h3>

<p>If your application for a GP visit card is refused, you will receive a
letter from the HSE stating this. The letter will also set out the reasons why
your application has been refused. If you are not satisfied with the decision,
you may have it reviewed. Your circumstances may have changed or you may have
left out some relevant information from the original application. If you are
not satisfied with the review you may make an appeal to the <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/yourhealthservice/Appeals/Appeals_Process/">Appeals
Office of your HSE Area</a>. The contact details will also be contained in your
letter of refusal. The Appeals Office will conduct a reassessment of your
application. This will be conducted by HSE staff who were not involved in
deciding on your original application. </p>

<h3>Reviews</h3>

<p>Your entitlement to a GP visit card is reviewed periodically. This is
because your circumstances may change. If you don’t return your review form,
your GP visit card may not be re-issued. </p>

<p>If you return your review form by the given date but the review process
continues past the expiry date of your card, the card’s validity may be
extended so that you can continue to use it while the review is taking place.
The extension is on a month-by-month basis so it is advisable to contact the
Client Registration Unit to confirm that your card has been extended and
continues to be valid.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>To qualify for a medical card your weekly income must be below a certain
figure for your family size. Here we explain the means test for those who are
aged under 70. See also <a href="medical_card.html">other information about
the medical card and how to apply</a>.</p>

<p>There are different <a href="medical_card_means_test_over_70s.html">means
test rules for those over 70 years of age</a>.</p>

<p>The assessment of a couple for medical card purposes is based on the age of
the older person.</p>

<p>Income, savings, investments and property (except for your own home) are
taken into account in the means test. However, there are certain exceptions.</p>

<p>According to the HSE's guidelines, if your income is derived solely from
social welfare allowances or benefits or HSE allowances, you should be granted
a medical card even though your payment may be in excess of the income
guidelines for your age and situation.</p>

<p>If your income is above the guidelines you will automatically be assessed
for the <a href="gp_visit_cards.html">GP visit card</a> which has higher
income limits. You can also apply for the <a href="drugs_payment_scheme.html">Drugs Payment Scheme</a>.</p>

<p>There are some <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html#l51453">categories
of people exempt from the means test</a>, including people entitled to a
medical card under EU Regulations.</p>

Reasonable expenses for childcare costs and rent/mortgage payments will also be
allowed. Mortgage-related insurance payments are allowable: fire and contents
insurance, mortgage protection insurance and associated life assurance.
Maintenance payments made are allowable. Nursing home costs are also
allowable.</p>

<p>For weekly travel costs to work, the actual cost of public transport is
allowable or, if a car is required, mileage at a rate of 30 cent per mile/18
cent per km. Where a couple needs two cars to travel to work, a double
allowance applies. The cost of parking can be taken into account. </p>

<p>If your income is over the limit, the deciding officer will consider whether
it would cause you undue hardship if you are refused a medical card. If you
think this may apply in your case, for example, if you have high medical
expenses, you can include details of your circumstances when you apply.</p>

<p>If you don’t qualify for a medical card, you are then assessed for a <a href="gp_visit_cards.html">GP visit card</a>. If your income is over the
relevant limit, the deciding officer will consider whether it would be
‘unduly burdensome’ for you to pay for GP Services if you don’t have a GP
visit card.</p>

<p>If you have children under the age of 6 and they are not eligible for
medical cards then they will be given <a href="gp_visit_cards_for_under_6s.html">GP visit cards for children under
6</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l395c1">Assessment of capital and property</h2>

<p>All capital (savings and investments) is taken into account for medical card
purposes. However, income from savings, investments or property of €36,000
for a single person or €72,000 for a couple is disregarded.</p>

<p>The value of your family home is not assessed.</p>

<p>For amounts over the disregard limits, interest is taken into account in the
means test. A notional assessment of interest is used.</p>

<p><strong>Notional assessment of interest </strong></p>

<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" border="1" width="400" summary="Notional assessment of interest"><thead><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>Capital </strong></td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>Weekly means assessed</strong> </td>

      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€4 per €1,000 </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>Certain specified types of State compensation are not assessable. Prize
bonds are included in the amount assessed.</p>

<p><strong>Property (other than the family home)</strong> Where land or
buildings are leased to another person, the income to be assessed will be the
gross income, less any cost necessarily incurred associated with the property
and such cost may include insurance premiums, loan/mortgage repayments,
maintenance etc. </p>

<p>For land or buildings that are not being used but are capable of being
leased or sold, the following assessment options can be used, with the more
beneficial option applying to the applicant: </p>
<ul><li>Notional assessment of the rental/lease “going rate” for the area.
  </li>
  <li>Assessment of capital value as in the table for capital, above. </li>
</ul></div>

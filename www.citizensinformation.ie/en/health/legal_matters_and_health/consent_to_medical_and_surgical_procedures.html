<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>As a general rule, medical or surgical procedures may not be carried out
without the informed consent of the patient. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/64/enacted/en/html">Assisted
Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015</a> provides <a href="http://health.gov.ie/blog/press-release/minister-kathleen-lynch-welcomes-groundbreaking-legislation-repealing-the-archaic-lunatics-act-and-lunacy-regulation/">laws
to support decision-making by adults who have difficulty in making decisions
without help</a>. The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not
yet been commenced to bring it into effect. <a href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/downloads/relate/relate_2016_04.pdf">Read
more about the Act (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>Until the Act is commenced, the law is not clear on what should happen in
cases where the patient is unable to give consent because, for example, of a
mental disorder or because he/she is comatose. </p>

<p>Similarly, the question of what consent is required in the case of children
is not totally clear.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>What is consent</h3>

<p>In general, valid consent must be informed consent where the patient has
sufficient information to be able to understand the nature of what is proposed
and the potential risks and benefits involved. The patient must have the
capacity to make the decision and must be free to do so without threat or
pressure from others. </p>

<h3>If there is no consent</h3>

<p>If a person carries out medical or surgical procedures without consent,
he/she could be charged with the crime of assault - the decision on charges is
made by the Director of Public Prosecutions. </p>

<p>He/she could also be sued for the tort (civil wrong) of trespass to the
person and possibly for breach of constitutional rights. If the person involved
is a medical professional, he/she could also be sued for negligence. The
patient may take these actions.</p>

<h3>Competence to give consent</h3>

<p>If you are a mentally competent adult, there is no doubt about the need for
consent but what exactly constitutes informed consent is not totally clear. </p>

<p>You may give a general consent – for example, you may tell your doctor to
do what he/she considers best. You may give implied consent by not specifically
ruling out certain procedures. </p>

<p>Your implied consent may arise out of necessity – for example, if
unexpected complications arise during an operation. </p>

<p>If you are seriously ill and not in a position to give or withhold consent,
the doctor may carry out what would be considered usual procedures arising from
necessity.</p>

<p>Sometimes doctors may consult with your family or nearest relatives but they
really have no legal right to give or withhold consent. </p>

<h3>Refusal of medical treatment</h3>

<p>It is clear that, if you are a mentally competent adult, you have the right
to refuse or discontinue medical treatment even if the inevitable consequence
is that you will die. This is different from taking positive measures to end
your own life or another person's life.</p>

<p>If you are not mentally competent, you are not in a position to make a
decision about refusing or discontinuing medical treatment. The law is not
clear on exactly who is competent to do this. In general, a medical
professional may make decisions that the treatment should be discontinued for
medical reasons. In some countries, <a href="advance_care_directives.html">Advance Healthcare Directives</a> may be
considered legally valid but there has been no ruling on this in Ireland. An
Advance Healthcare Directive is a document in which a person sets out their
wishes about the continuation or otherwise of medical treatment if they should
become mentally incapable.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/64/enacted/en/html">Assisted
Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015</a> provides laws to support
decision-making by adults who have difficulty in making decisions without help.
The Act also provides laws for Advance Healthcare Directives. The Act was
signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been commenced to bring it
into effect.</p>

<p>An enduring power of attorney does not give the attorney the power to make
decisions of this nature on behalf of the person granting the power.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>It is the practice for doctors and other medical professionals to get the
consent of parents or guardians for medical and surgical procedures to be
carried out on minors.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has held that a health board (now replaced by the Health
Service Executive) did not have the right to insist on having a test carried
out on a child without parental permission. This case involved the PKU or heel
pin-prick test, which is usually carried out on babies shortly after birth. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/supreme_court.html">Supreme
Court</a> held that only in exceptional circumstances would the court intervene
and make an order contrary to the wishes of the parents. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0026/sec0023.html#zza26y1997s23">Section
23 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997</a> provides that
young people of 16 and over may give valid consent to medical, surgical and
dental treatment. </p>

<h3>Consent to psychiatric treatment</h3>

<p>There are specific laws about consent in relation to the <a href="../mental_health/rights_of_psychiatric_patients.html">rights of
psychiatric patients</a>.</p>

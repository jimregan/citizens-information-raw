<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>Health and personal social services are delivered by the Health Service
Executive (HSE), through medical professionals and hospitals and through a
network of <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">Local Health
Offices</a>, health centres and clinics at community level. </p>

<p>Health services can be broadly defined as those services that are concerned
with the</p>
<ul><li>promotion of good health </li>
  <li>prevention of illness (for example, food safety services, immunisation
    and vaccinations services, health screening, infant and child health
    services) </li>
  <li>the diagnosis and treatment of illness (for example, family doctor (GP)
    services, hospital services) </li>
</ul></div>
Community care and personal social services can be broadly defined as those
that are designed to enable people to remain living in their communities,
especially when they have difficulties doing so because of illness, disability
or age. Examples include home nursing services, home helps, occupational
therapy and social work services.<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l5f213">Provision of health and personal social
services</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/about/Who/is/">Integrated Services
Directorate</a> manages all hospital and community public health services.</p>

<p>The National Director has responsibility for the delivery of all health and
personal social services across the country including hospital, primary,
community and continuing care services. </p>
</div>
The range of health and personal social services provided by the HSE and its
funded agencies are managed within four Regions, each with a Regional Directors
of Operations.<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lcd50e">HSE Administrative Areas</h2>

<p>The main function of a HSE Administrative Area is to provide or arrange for
the provision of health, community care and personal social services to the
people in its area. They provide many of the services directly and they arrange
for the provision of other services by health professionals, private health
service providers, voluntary hospitals and voluntary/community
organisations.</p>

<p>The geographic areas covered by each of the Administrative Areas are;</p>

<p><strong>HSE Dublin Mid-Leinster</strong>: Dublin city south of the River
Liffey, south Dublin county, Wicklow, Kildare, Longford, Westmeath, Laois,
Offally</p>

<p><strong>HSE Dublin North East</strong>: Dublin City north of the River
Liffey, the community of Fingal county, Louth, Meath, Cavan, Monaghan </p>

<p><strong>HSE South</strong>: Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary (South Riding)

<h3>Access to services</h3>

<p>The main delivery point for community health and personal social services is
through the network of 32 Local Health Offices and local health centres. </p>

<p>The wide range of services that are provided through Local Health Offices
and from health centres include general practitioner services, public health
nursing, child health services, community welfare, chiropody, ophthalmic,
speech therapy, social work, addiction counselling and treatment,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, psychiatric services and home help. </p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l8bad4">Duty of HSE to provide services</h2>

<p>The HSE Area is obliged to provide certain services, e.g., family doctor
(GP) and public hospital services. There are other services that they may
provide, e.g., home helps and other community care services. A significant part
of the HSE Area's overall budget is allocated to those services that are
obligatory. </p>

<p>The Health Strategy recognises that all decisions whether financial or
clinical must be based on the best available evidence. Decisions will be based
on:</p>
<ul><li>Research findings </li>
  <li>Statistical qualitative or quantitative data </li>
  <li>Other documented trends and behaviours. </li>
</ul><p>All HSE Administrative Areas must provide service plans that usually review
the previous year's spending and give a detailed breakdown of how funding
provided by the HSE will be spent during the year in question. The Department
of Health formally sets out a statement of national priorities for health,
which is then addressed by the HSE in preparing their individual service plans.

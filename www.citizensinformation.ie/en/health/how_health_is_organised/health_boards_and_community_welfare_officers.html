<p>The Department of Social Protection's representatives, formerly known as
Community Welfare Officers (CWOs), are employed throughout Ireland by the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie">Department of Social Protection</a>. CWOs were
previously employed by the <a shape="rect" href="health_boards.html">Health
Service Executive (HSE)</a>. In legislation they are called <em>designated
persons</em>.</p>

<p>They are based in health centres or DSP offices and are responsible for the
day-to-day administration of the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary
Welfare Allowance Scheme</a>. </p>

<h3>Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme</h3>

<p>The Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme is funded and legislated for by
the Department of Social Protection. The payments made under this scheme
include: <a href="supplementary_welfare_allow.html">weekly Supplementary
Welfare Allowance</a>, <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a>, <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/mortgage_interest_supplement.html">Mortgage
Interest Supplement</a>, <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/diet_and_heating_supplements.html">Diet
and Heating Supplements</a>, <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/back_to_school_clothing_and_footwear_allowance.html">Back
to School Clothing and Footwear Scheme</a> and exceptional needs payments for
items such as buggies, clothing, etc. </p>

<p>Department of Social Protection (DSP) staff are responsible for assessing
the income of a person applying for payments under the Supplementary Welfare
Allowance Scheme. This assessment may involve home visits to verify a person's
place of residence for Rent Supplement purposes or simply to interview someone
in surroundings that are more comfortable if he or she has special needs or is
unable to visit his or her local health centre in person. </p>

<p>DSP staff will actively refer individuals to other state agencies and/or
voluntary organisations if these are appropriate to the client's needs. For
example, you may be referred to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/mabs_service.html">Money Advice and
Budgeting Service (MABS)</a>. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Decisions made by DSP staff</h3>

<p>DSP staff (designated persons) make decisions about applications under the
Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme. While they make the decision, they may
consult their immediate manager. </p>

<h3>Appealing a decision</h3>

<p>If you are unhappy with a decision made made by a designated person, you may
appeal the decision. </p>

<p>If your appeal concerns a payment of basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance,
Mortgage or Rent Supplement, you have a right to have your appeal heard by the
<a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_welfare_appeals.html">Social
Welfare Appeals Office</a>. Discretionary payments such as Exceptional Needs
Payments cannot be appealed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office but they can
be reviewed by another staff member on request. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<p>There is <span>no charge for making an appeal</span> against a decision of a
designated person. <span>There is also no charge for appealing a
decision</span> to the Office of the Ombudsman or to the Social Welfare Appeals
Office. <br></p>

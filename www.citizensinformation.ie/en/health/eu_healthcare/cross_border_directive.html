<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are entitled to public health services in Ireland, you may opt to
access those services in another member state of the <a href="../../government_in_ireland/european_government/european_union.html">European
Union (EU)</a> or European Economic Area (EEA), which also includes Iceland,
Liechtenstein and Norway, and be repaid the cost if you meet the requirements.
This is provided for by the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:088:0045:0065:en:PDF">EU
Directive 2011/24/EU, pdf</a>).</p>

<p>The amount that will be repaid is the cost of the public healthcare
treatment in Ireland, or the cost of your treatment abroad, if that is less. It
does not include other costs such as travel.</p>

<p>Treatments that qualify for the <a href="treatment_abroad_scheme.html">Treatment Abroad Scheme</a> are not
covered under the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive. In general, the Treatment
Abroad Scheme covers treatments that are not available in Ireland while the
Cross-Border Healthcare Directive only covers treatments that are publicly
funded and available in Ireland. <a href="travelling_for_healthcare.html">Read about the differences between the
two schemes</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Funding will only be reimbursed for healthcare that is publicly funded and
available in Ireland but the referral may be to a public or private health
service in the other country. You pay the costs of treatment and then apply for
a refund when you return to Ireland.</p>

<p>Examples of healthcare that is available under the scheme include:</p>
<ul><li>Day, in-patient and out-patient care in acute hospital services,
    including psychiatric services</li>
  <li>Community-based out-patient care</li>
  <li>Dental and orthodontic services (with some exceptions, such as dental
    screening services in schools)</li>
  <li>Speech and language services</li>
  <li>Occupational therapy services (with some exceptions, such as assessment
    for aids at home)</li>
  <li>Psychology services</li>
  <li>Physiotherapy services</li>
  <li>Disability services</li>
  <li>Ophthalmic services</li>
  <li>Mental health services</li>
  <li>Methadone programme</li>
  <li>Addiction care (following the <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/acchealthcareabroad/Addiction_Care_Abroad.pdf">process
    to access addiction care abroad</a>)</li>
</ul><p>Some health services are not included, for example, organ transplantation
and long-term care such as nursing home care. </p>

<p>The HSE has provided a list of <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/faqs/">Frequently Asked
Questions</a> about the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>To use health services in another country and be refunded under the
Cross-Border Healthcare Directive you must:</p>
<ul><li>Be referred to the health service abroad</li>
  <li>Get prior authorisation if it is required for your treatment</li>
  <li>Apply for a refund of your costs</li>
</ul><h3>Referral to healthcare abroad</h3>

<p>In the same way that you would be referred to public health services in
Ireland, you must be referred to the health service you require abroad. This
may be, for example, by your GP (family doctor) or public hospital consultant.
In the case of some community-based services the appropriate referral could be
by a Health Service Executive (HSE) professional such as a public health nurse,
community dentist or HSE orthodontist.</p>

<p>The referral letter should specify the healthcare required, the health
professional abroad you are being referred to and their clinic, hospital or
other location. You, or the person referring you, should be satisfied that the
healthcare provider abroad is qualified and suitable. If you wish to access
information on services or service providers abroad please contact the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/health/cross_border_care/docs/cbhc_ncp_en.pdf">National
Contact Point for the other EU/EEA State</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure that the service you are seeking to access abroad is covered by
the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive. Your referring clinician can advise you
about this but if you are in doubt you can contact the <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/contact/">National
Contact Point in Ireland</a> to check.</p>

<h3>Prior authorisation</h3>

<p>If the treatment involves an overnight stay in hospital then it will need to
be authorised in advance by the HSE. For other treatment it is advisable to
check whether prior authorisation is required by contacting the <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/contact/">National
Contact Point</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/appreimbursement/HSE_CBD_Application_for_Prior_Authorisation_.pdf">application
form for prior authorisation (pdf)</a> must be completed by you and by the
medical professional who is referring you for treatment abroad. Completed
applications take 15 to 20 working days to process and you will be notified of
the decision by letter.</p>

<p>Prior authorisation is also required for healthcare that involves:</p>
<ul><li>Highly specialised and cost-intensive medical infrastructure or
  equipment</li>
  <li>Treatments presenting a particular risk for the patient or the
  population</li>
  <li>A healthcare provider that could give rise to serious and specific
    concerns relating to the quality or safety of the care</li>
</ul><h3>Applying for a refund of costs</h3>

<p>To get a refund of the costs that you pay for your treatment, you and your
healthcare provider abroad must complete the <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/appreimbursement/HSE_Cross_Border_Directive_Pro-Forma_Invoice.pdf">HSE
Cross-Border Healthcare Directive Pro-Forma Invoice (pdf)</a> and submit it
with the invoice from the healthcare provider and receipt.</p>

<p>The refund will only be made to the patient (or to the parents of a child
patient).</p>

<p>The HSE has published the <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/Ready%20Reckoner.pdf">refund
amounts for different treatments</a>. Treatments are listed according to a code
– you can get the code for your treatment from the healthcare professional
who has referred you. If you prefer, or if your treatment is not listed, you
can get details of the refund rates from the <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/contact/">National
Contact Point</a>.</p>

<p>For in-patient treatment, the <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/hospital_services/hospital_charges.html">charges
for public in-patients in public hospitals in Ireland</a> will apply. This
means that €75 per night (up to a maximum of €750) will be deducted from
the refund payable.</p>

<h3>Appeals</h3>

<p>If your application is refused you can appeal to the Assistant National
Director of the Contracts Department of the HSE – contact the <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/contact/">National
Contact Point</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are resident in Ireland you can choose to access healthcare in other
countries in the <a href="../../government_in_ireland/european_government/european_union.html">European
Union (EU)</a>, the European Economic Area (the EEA also includes Iceland,
Liechtenstein and Norway) or Switzerland.</p>

<p>You can get <strong>planned</strong> healthcare abroad under the <a href="treatment_abroad_scheme.html">Treatment Abroad Scheme</a> or the <a href="cross_border_directive.html">Cross-Border Healthcare Directive</a>.</p>

<p>In general, the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive only covers treatments
that <strong>are</strong> available in Ireland while the Treatment Abroad
Scheme covers treatments that <strong>are not</strong> available in Ireland.</p>

<p>If a treatment is covered by the Treatment Abroad Scheme, you cannot get a
refund for it under the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive, so it is important
to apply under the appropriate scheme. The differences are summarised below,
with links to more detailed information.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../travel_and_recreation/travel_abroad/e111.html">European Health
Insurance Card</a> does not entitle you to travel abroad with the aim of
getting public healthcare. It covers unplanned healthcare for Irish residents
who become sick or injured while travelling in another country in the EU, EEA
or Switzerland.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l83e81">Cross-Border Healthcare Directive</h2>

<p>If you are entitled to health services that are publicly funded and
available in Ireland, you may opt to access those services in another member
state of the EU or EEA under the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive.</p>
<ul><li>The treatment abroad can be in public or private healthcare.</li>
  <li>Some types of treatment need to be authorised in advance.</li>
  <li>You pay for the healthcare and then apply for a refund.</li>
  <li>You need the same kind of referral for healthcare abroad as you would for
    healthcare in Ireland. For example, from a GP (family doctor) or hospital
    consultant.</li>
  <li>Travel costs and living expenses abroad are not covered.</li>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l387ea">Treatment Abroad Scheme</h2>

<p>If you are a public healthcare patient and require treatment that is not
available in Ireland or, taking account of your medical circumstances, is not
available within the time normally necessary to obtain it, you may be able to
use the Treatment Abroad Scheme to get the treatment in another country in the
EU, EEA or Switzerland.</p>
<ul><li>The treatment abroad must be in public healthcare.</li>
  <li>Treatment must be pre-authorised.</li>
  <li>You do not have to pay the healthcare provider abroad for pre-authorised
    treatment.</li>
  <li>You must be referred for treatment abroad by an Irish-based consultant
    who is treating you as a public patient. You cannot refer yourself or be
    referred by a GP.</li>
  <li>The Treatment Abroad Scheme may provide assistance with travel costs for
    the patient and a travelling companion where appropriate.</li>

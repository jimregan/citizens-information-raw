<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are a public healthcare patient and require treatment that is not
available to you in Ireland, you may be able to use the Treatment Abroad Scheme
to get the treatment in another country in the <a href="../../government_in_ireland/european_government/european_union.html">European
Union (EU)</a>, the European Economic Area (the EEA also includes Iceland,
Liechtenstein and Norway) or Switzerland.</p>

<p>Treatment that is available in Ireland may be accessed abroad under the <a href="cross_border_directive.html">Cross-Border Healthcare Directive</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To qualify for the Treatment Abroad Scheme, you must need medical treatment
that is not available in Ireland or, taking account of your medical
circumstances, is not available within the time normally necessary to obtain
it. It must be a treatment that comes under the benefits provided for in Irish
law. Unproven, experimental or test treatments are not covered.</p>

<p>The treatment you have abroad must be in public healthcare under a
registered medical practitioner in a recognised hospital or other institution
that accepts form S2 (also known as E112). Form S2 authorises treatment abroad
so that the patient does not have to make any payment to the healthcare
provider.</p>

<p>You must provide confirmation of every appointment you are due to attend so
that the Health Service Executive (HSE) can issue an S2 form that will cover
the cost of your visit. If you don’t have the document at your appointment,
you may be charged and not be refunded.</p>

<p>Additional treatments or associated examinations or consultations which may
arise while you are abroad, but have not been pre-approved, will not be
covered.</p>

<p>The Treatment Abroad Scheme may provide assistance with travel costs for the
patient and a travelling companion, where appropriate.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You must be referred for treatment abroad by an Irish-based consultant who
is treating you as a public patient. You cannot refer yourself or be referred
by a GP.</p>

<p>You, and your referring consultant, must complete an application form and
include a copy of your referral letter. The HSE has produced a <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/treatmentabroad/Guidance_for_Consultants.pdf">guide
for consultants referring patients for funding under the Treatment Abroad
Scheme (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>Your application must be approved by the HSE before you travel or start
treatment abroad. You will get a decision on your application by letter,
usually within 15 to 20 working days. If your application is not approved, you
will be told the reasons and given information on how to appeal the
decision.</p>

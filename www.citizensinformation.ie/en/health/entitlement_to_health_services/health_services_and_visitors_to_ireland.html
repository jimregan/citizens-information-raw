<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Certain visitors may be entitled to free public health services. In
particular, people from other European Union (EU) or European Economic Area
(EEA) member states or Switzerland who are visiting Ireland temporarily (for
example, on holiday or on business) are entitled to medical care if they become
ill or have an accident.</p>

<p>Some categories of people are entitled to <a href="medical_card.html">medical cards</a> under EU rules.</p>

<p><a href="http://health.gov.ie/blog/press-release/reciprocal-agreement-on-medical-treatment-for-temporary-visitors-between-ireland-and-australia/">Ireland
and Australia have a reciprocal health agreement</a>. This means that
Australian visitors to Ireland are entitled to receive emergency public
hospital treatment subject to the normal charges for non-medical card holders
in Ireland. They are also entitled to assistance towards the cost of prescribed
drugs and medicines on the same basis as people normally resident in Ireland.
</p>

<p>People who come to live, work or study in Ireland for a longer period or who
retire to Ireland are likely to be regarded as living here (<em>ordinarily
resident</em> is the legal term) and to come under the rules as described in <a shape="rect" href="entitlement_to_public_health_services.html">Entitlement to
health services</a> and <a shape="rect" href="medical_card.html">medical
cards</a>.</p>

<p>Other visitors to Ireland are not entitled to avail of free or subsidised
public health services except in cases of hardship. In general, if they have to
use health services, they must pay the full economic cost of those services.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Your <a href="entitlement_to_public_health_services.html">entitlement to
health services</a> is mainly based on residency and means, rather than on your
payment of tax or <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">Pay
Related Social Insurance (PRSI)</a>. There are, however, some exceptions and
these are described below. </p>

<p>Your nationality, in itself, does not determine your entitlement but there
are specific rules covering EU/EEA nationals and Swiss nationals. </p>

<h3>European Union rules</h3>

<p>If you have an entitlement to healthcare in another EU/EEA member State or
Switzerland, you may have an entitlement to healthcare in Ireland under EU
rules. </p>

<p>If you are visiting Ireland temporarily you can apply for a <a href="../../travel_and_recreation/travel_abroad/e111.html">European Health
Insurance Card</a> which covers medical care if you become ill or have an
accident.You should bring your European Health Insurance Card with you when you
are travelling to Ireland. If you are from the UK you can bring evidence of UK
residence instead.</p>

<p>Certain categories of people, such as posted workers, are eligible for
medical cards under EU rules â€“ see the further information section on <a href="medical_card.html">medical cards</a>.</p>

<h3>Nationals of countries that are not in the EU, EEA or Switzerland</h3>

<p>In general, if you are a national of a non-EU or non-EEA country (with the
exception of Switzerland), you are regarded as <a href="entitlement_to_public_health_services.html">ordinarily resident</a> in
Ireland if you can show the HSE that you intend to live here for at least a
year. The HSE may look for evidence that you are legally entitled to live here
for at least a year. </p>

<p>If you are here for a shorter period, you are regarded as a visitor and you
do not have any entitlement to free or subsidised health services. You may wish
to consider taking out travel insurance.</p>

<p>If you are a dependant of someone who is not a EU, EEA or Swiss national,
the same rules about ordinary residence apply to you. In other words, the fact
that someone who is not a EU, EEA, or Swiss national has established
eligibility for health services here does not mean that their non-resident
dependants are also entitled to health services in Ireland. </p>

<h3>Students from countries that are not in the EU, EEA or Switzerland</h3>

<p>If you are a student from a non-EU or non-EEA country (with the exception of
Switzerland), you are generally regarded as <a href="entitlement_to_public_health_services.html">ordinarily resident</a> if
you are registered for a course of study that will last for at least one
academic year. </p>

<p>If you are here for a shorter period, you are regarded as a visitor and you
do not have any entitlement to free or subsidised health services.</p>

<h3>Asylum seekers and refugees</h3>

<p>Asylum seekers are given medical cards for the period during which their
application for refugee status is being considered. If you get refugee status,
then you are regarded as ordinarily resident and you come under the usual rules
for entitlement to health services. </p>

<h3>Irish nationals who have been living outside Ireland</h3>

<p>If you come back to live in Ireland and are working or self-employed here or
if you intend to stay for a year, then you are ordinarily resident and come
under the usual rules. </p>

<p>If you are not in this situation and you have been living and working in
another EU/EEA country or Switzerland, your entitlement to health services when
you return is decided under the rules applying to EU nationals.</p>

<p>If you have been abroad on a short-term contract, you continue to be
regarded as ordinarily resident.</p>

<p>If you have been resident abroad for a period of up to three years but your
Local Health Office of the HSE is satisfied that you did not establish an
entitlement to health services in any other country, the HSE should regard you
as ordinarily resident in Ireland if you require treatment when you return to
Ireland. This is so that people who emigrate from Ireland do not lose their
health service eligibility on residence grounds before they have a chance to
establish eligibility elsewhere. This provision does not apply where someone is
covered by EU regulations in another country and, in particular, it would not
entitle a person temporarily resident in another EU country to have the HSE
extend the European Health Insurance Card beyond the normal period. </p>

<h3>People who are not entitled to free health services</h3>

<p>If you are not ordinarily resident and you are not entitled to health care
under any of the circumstances described above, the HSE may apply the full
economic cost for any services provided. In cases of hardship the HSE may
provide urgent necessary treatment at a reduced charge or without charge. </p>

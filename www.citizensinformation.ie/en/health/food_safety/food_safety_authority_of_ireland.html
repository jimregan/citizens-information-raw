<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) was established as a statutory
body by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, 1998. Its main function is to
ensure that food produced, distributed or marketed in Ireland meets the highest
standards of food safety and hygiene reasonably available and to ensure that
food complies with legal requirements and recognised codes of good practice.</p>

<p>Food legislation is enforced on behalf of the FSAI by a network of official
agencies working under service contract to the FSAI.</p>

<h3>Main activities of the FSAI</h3>

<p>The main activities of the FSAI are:</p>
<ul><li>Co-ordinating food safety control programmes. </li>
  <li>Inspecting, approving, licensing and registering premises involved in
    food production and distribution at manufacturing, wholesale and retail
    levels. </li>
  <li>Auditing food safety activities in Ireland to ensure best practices are
    being observed. </li>
  <li>Linking up with the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hpsc.ie">Health
    Protection Surveillance Centre</a>, the Health Service Executive (HSE) and
    the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/">Department of
    Agriculture, Food and the Marine</a> to gather relevant data on human and
    animal infections. This is to identify the current public health priorities
    and emerging problems so that control measures can be targeted
    appropriately. </li>
  <li>Providing education and advice for all, from primary producers to
    consumers, on how to prevent foodborne illness. </li>
  <li>Linking with the Department of Health's <a shape="rect" href="http://www.healthpromotion.ie/">Health Promotion Unit</a> and
    existing bodies in the area, to provide advice on matters such as
    nutrition, food technology, industrial practices, the cultivation of food
    plants and animals, food labelling and packaging and on improving systems
    for the communication of information to the public on food safety and
    hygiene in the home. </li>
</ul><h3>Service contracts</h3>

<p>The FSAI may exercise its authority directly or by service contracts with
other agencies. It has entered into service contracts with: the local
authorities; the HSE; the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; The
Marine Institute; The National Standards Authority of Ireland; and The Sea
Fisheries Protection Authority. </p>

<p>Each service contract includes the targets and objectives that the Authority
wishes the agency to meet and the timeframe within which these must be
achieved. The Authority has published details of the contracts and has a system
of monitoring to ensure the contracts are being adhered to. </p>

<p>The FSAI has a Memorandum of Understanding with 
Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Revenue’s Customs Service, and the
Loughs Agency. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Enforcement of food safety standards</h3>

<p>The Authority has the power to carry out the following in order to determine
compliance with food legislation: </p>
<ul><li>The inspection, approval, licensing or registration of premises and
    equipment, including premises or equipment used in connection with the
    manufacture, processing, disposal, transport and storage of food </li>
  <li>The inspection, sampling, and analysis of food and food including food
    ingredients </li>
  <li>The inspection and analysis of food labelling </li>
</ul><p>The FSAI carries out its enforcement role by means of service contracts with
the official agencies.</p>

<p>In order to maintain full traceability, the Authority's remit includes
farms, other places of primary production, water treatment plants and any other
source of materials used in food production. </p>

<p>The authority has a wide ranging power to seek reports from any State body
on a matter that, in its opinion, impinges on food safety and to report to the
Minister for Health. </p>

<h3>Authorised officers</h3>

<p>The Authority has authorised officers who have extensive powers to enter and
inspect food premises, to secure these premises for later inspection, to
inspect and, if necessary, remove records. These officers may take samples of
food or related materials and have these samples analysed and it is an offence
for any person to obstruct an officer in carrying out this duty.</p>

<p>The authorised officers are the staff of the various agencies involved in
food safety, including Environmental Health Officers from the Health Service
Executive (HSE).</p>

<h3>Improvement notices</h3>

<p>Where an authorised officer is of the view that any premises or activity
poses a threat to public health, he/she has the power to set out the action
required to remedy the situation and set a time limit for its completion. The
officer may serve an improvement notice, which is binding on the recipient.
Improvement notices are used where there is clear need for some remedial action
but where a complete shut-down of operations may not be warranted. Where an
improvement notice is not complied with, the officer may seek an order from the
<a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/district_court.html">District
Court</a> to force compliance – this is known as an improvement order.</p>

<h3>Closure order</h3>

<p>In more serious cases, where the officer believes there is an immediate and
grave threat to public health, a closure order may be made. This means that the
operation must cease until the problem has been remedied. </p>

<h3>Prohibition order</h3>

<p>In cases where unsafe products or product batches have been distributed by
the producer and are on the market, authorised officers may insist on the
withdrawal, recall, detention and supervised destruction of products posing a
threat to public health – they issue prohibition orders in these cases. </p>

<h3>Prosecutions</h3>

<p>Breaches of the food safety laws may be prosecuted by the FSAI or any of the
agencies involved.</p>

<h3>Promotion of food safety</h3>

<p>The FSAI provides information and advice on a whole range of food safety
issues, including foodborne diseases and risks and how to prevent food
poisoning. Information is available from the address below or from the FSAI
website. That site also has details of <a shape="rect" href="https://www.fsai.ie/news_centre/alerts.html">Alert Notifications and
product recalls</a> as well as Codes of Practice that have been agreed with
various food producers. There are also guidance notes for retailers on the food
safety laws and advice for consumers and the food industry.</p>

<h3>Food safety assurance schemes</h3>

<p>The Authority may, either on its own initiative or in co-operation with food
producers' representatives, establish schemes to protect consumer interests.
These food safety assurance schemes cover the promotion of best practice and
preparation of guidelines on raw materials, processing, packaging, preparation,
storage and handling.</p>

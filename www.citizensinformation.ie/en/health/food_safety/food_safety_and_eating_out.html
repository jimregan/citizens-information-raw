<p>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) protects consumers' health by
ensuring that food consumed, distributed, marketed or produced in Ireland meets
the highest standards of food safety and hygiene. In addition, the FSAI have
responsibility for ensuring that food that is sold in food premises complies
with legal requirements, or where appropriate, with recognised codes of good
practice. </p>

<p>In general, food safety standards are high. These food safety standards are
also set down in law to protect the consumer and to set out best practice for
retailers. On the ground, enforcement of food safety standards operates through
the network of <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/environ/Contact.html">Environmental
Health Officers</a> appointed in each <a shape="rect" href="../how_health_is_organised_boards.html">Health Service Executive (HSE)
Area</a> throughout the country. If you are unhappy about the quality of food
you have purchased or you have concerns regarding the cleanliness of a food
premises, it is important to know how to notify the authorities of your
concerns. </p>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0029/index.html">Food
Safety Authority Act 1998</a>, the Authority is empowered to issue special
enforcement provisions. These enforcement provisions are in addition to the
powers to prosecute offenders on specific pieces of food legislation. Broadly
speaking, the law entitles the Food Safety Authority or its officials to issue
three different types of enforcement orders for breaches of food safety
legislation.</p>
<ul><li><span>Improvement order</span>: issued by the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a>
    against an offender. Issued when any activity involving the handling,
    preparation etc. of food, or the condition of a premises where food is
    handled or prepared may pose a risk to public health. </li>
  <li><span>Closure order</span>: issued if there is, or is likely to be a
    grave and immediate danger to public health at the food premises. It may be
    lifted when premises improve. </li>
  <li><span>Prohibition order</span>: issued if the activities (handling,
    processing, disposal, manufacturing, storage, distribution or selling food)
    involve, or are likely to involve, a serious risk to public health from a
    particular product, class, batch or item of food. The effect is to prohibit
    the sale of the product, either temporarily or permanently. </li>
</ul><p><a shape="rect" href="https://www.fsai.ie/enforcement_audit/enforcement/order/enf_criteria.html">Closure
and prohibition orders</a> are listed on the FSAI website.</p>

<h3>Making a complaint about a food premises</h3>

<p>If you have a complaint about food you have consumed or a food premises you
have visited, you should contact the <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/environ/Contact.html">Environmental
Health Officer (EHO) in your HSE Area</a> as soon as possible. </p>

<p>Normally following a complaint, an official will arrange to meet with you.
At this meeting, you will discuss making an official complaint and the official
will help you to complete an official complaint form. If you submit a food
complaint, the unfit food may be sent to a laboratory for analysis. You will be
contacted with the result. Alternatively, you can have suspect food analysed
independently for a fee by contacting the Public Analyst Laboratory in your
region. </p>

<p>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has issued some important advice for
consumers when shopping. When shopping for food, there are a number of things
you should look out for.</p>

<p>You should <span>never</span> buy:</p>
<ul><li>Food from butchers or shop assistants if raw food and cooked food are not
    separated in the display counter. Similarly, you should not buy food items
    if the server handles raw meat or poultry and then handles cooked food
    using the same utensil or without washing their hands. </li>
  <li>Dairy products and other chilled or frozen food that is left out of
    fridges. </li>
  <li>Cracked eggs. </li>
  <li>Swollen chilled food packages and cans. </li>
  <li>Leaking cartons, cans, bottles or containers. </li>
  <li>Food products with broken or imperfect safety seals. </li>
  <li>Products with moulds, discolouration or infestation. </li>
  <li>Products in vacuum packs, e.g. rashers and other meat products, where the
    pack is not tightly sealed around the food. </li>
</ul><h3>Self-service salad bars</h3>

<p>Salads should be displayed in a chilled dispenser unit to keep them fresh
and each salad should have its own utensil. </p>

<p>Always use a container from the dispenser or stack of containers provided.
</p>

<p>Never touch the food with your hands and do not sneeze or cough near the
food. If you see anyone mis-handling the food, report it to a member of
staff.</p>

<p>In addition, you should follow the supermarket's instructions carefully. </p>

<h3>"Best before"/"Use by" dates</h3>

<p>You should always check <span>best before</span> and <span>use by
dates</span> on food, especially food with a short shelf life such as dairy
products. The <span>best before date</span> is the date until which the food
keeps its best properties, if stored properly. The <span>use by date</span> is
a warning that the food should no longer be consumed or sold once the date
mentioned is passed. </p>

<h3>Packing food</h3>

<p>You should always choose refrigerated and frozen products such as meat,
dairy products, deli products, ice cream and frozen meals towards the end of
your shopping trip and keep them separated from hot food. You will not be
subject to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/environment/waste_management_and_recycling/plastic_bag_environmental_levy.html">Plastic
Bag Environmental Levy</a> if you use a smaller plastic bag to store meat, fish
and poultry products, regardless of whether they are packaged or unpackaged. In
addition, you will not be subject to the levy if you use plastic bags to store
non-packaged food like dairy products, fruit, vegetables, nuts, confectionery,
hot and cold cooked food and ice</p>

<p>You should avoid overloading your trolley as you may damage packaging. </p>

<p>Never leave your groceries in a warm car as germs multiply in warm
temperatures. If you are travelling a long distance, place your chilled and
frozen products into a cool bag or box for the journey home - these can be
purchased from many supermarkets. </p>

<h3>Storing food at home</h3>

<p>When you get home, immediately pack chilled and frozen products into the
fridge or freezer. Check the condition of frozen products and do not re-freeze
them if they have thawed. You should make sure your fridge temperature is below
4Â°C.</p>

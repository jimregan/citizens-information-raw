<p>A number of different agencies have a role in food safety and environmental
health services in Ireland and throughout the European Union (EU). </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../how_health_is_organised/department_of_health_and_children.html">Department
of Health</a> has an overall policy role on food hygiene and safety in Ireland.
The <a href="http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/">Department of Agriculture, Food
and the Marine</a> has responsibility for a number of areas, mainly primary
food products and animal health. Local authorities and the Health Service
Executive (HSE) also have a role in implementing food safety rules. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="food_safety_authority_of_ireland.html">Food Safety
Authority of Ireland</a> has the overall co-ordinating role for food safety
control programmes and monitoring. It works with the agencies listed above and
with other agencies including the <a href="http://www.sfpa.ie/">Sea-Fisheries
Protection Authority</a>, which is responsible for seafood safety.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hpra.ie/">Health Products Regulatory Authority</a>
is the statutory body that regulates medicines, medical devices and other
health products.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="safefood.html">Safefood â€“ the Food Safety Promotion
Board</a> is a cross-border body set up under the Good Friday Agreement to
promote food safety on the island of Ireland.</p>

<h3>Food safety legislation</h3>

<p>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland provides comprehensive information on
<a href="https://www.fsai.ie/legislation.html">Irish and international food
laws</a>.</p>

<h3>Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine</h3>

<p>The Department has overall responsibility for animal health and welfare and
for some areas of plant health. It also has direct responsibility in a number
of primary product areas. </p>

<p>The Department's Veterinary Public Health Inspectorate is responsible for
official controls in milk pasteurisation, slaughterhouses, meat processing
plants and egg product facilities. </p>

<h3>HSE Environmental Health Officers</h3>

<p>Environmental Health Officers are employed by the HSE and implement national
and EU laws on food safety and hygiene. They sometimes provide services for the
local authorities as well. Among their responsibilities in the food safety area
are:</p>
<ul><li>Food control, including maintaining a register of food premises,
    inspecting all premises where food is manufactured or sold and
    investigating complaints about unfit food </li>
  <li>Enforcing the smoking laws in public places </li>
  <li>Enforcing the rules on sale and storage of poisons </li>
</ul><p>Environmental Health Officers have other public health and environmental
functions, including pest control, monitoring of temporary dwellings, and
inspection of public buildings such as schools and places of entertainment. </p>

<p>Individuals may <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/environ/Contact.html">contact
Environmental Health Officers</a> to complain about matters such as hygiene in
food premises or water quality.</p>

<h3>European Union food safety agencies</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.efsa.europa.eu/">European Food Safety Authority</a>
is an independent EU agency whose main role is to provide independent
scientific advice. It also assesses risks relating to the food chain and
informs the public accordingly.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/european_government/eu_institutions/european_commission.html">European
Commission</a> includes a <a shape="rect" href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/health_food-safety/index_en.htm">Directorate-General
for Health and Food Safety</a>. This Directorate General has responsibility for
food inspection and control.</p>

<p>While the European Food Safety Authority advises on possible risk related to
food safety, the responsibility for risk management lies with the <a href="../../government_in_ireland/european_government/european_union.html">EU
institutions</a> (the European Commission, Parliament and Council). It is the
role of the EU institutions, taking into account the European Food Safety
Authority's advice and other considerations, to propose and adopt legislation,
as well as regulatory and control measures as required. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://ec.europa.eu/food/food_veterinary_office/index_en.htm">EU Food and
Veterinary Office</a> is responsible for monitoring compliance with various EU
laws including those on food hygiene. It carries out inspections and audits in
EU States and in countries exporting to the EU. It also carries out audits
regarding animal health and welfare, plant health, and the use of chemicals
(such as pesticides, veterinary medicines and growth stimulants). </p>

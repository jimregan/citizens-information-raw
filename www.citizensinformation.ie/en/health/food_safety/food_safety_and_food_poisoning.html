<p>If you suspect that you have food poisoning, it is important that you
contact or visit your family doctor (GP). Food poisoning symptoms can occur
days after you have eaten contaminated food. </p>

<p>Symptoms of food poisoning usually include one or more of the following:</p>
<ul><li>Stomach pains </li>
  <li>Vomiting </li>
  <li>Fever and </li>
  <li>Diarrhoea </li>
</ul><p>You should always report a confirmed food poisoning illness to your <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">Local Health
Office</a> or the Food Safety Auhority of Ireland (FSAI). If other people
report illness associated with similar products or outlets, your report will
help highlight the precise numbers of people affected. This will also permit
the public health doctors and environmental health officers to identify
problems. Your vigilance in pointing out a problem can prevent others becoming
seriously ill.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you have eaten or bought food that is not safe or of a satisfactory
standard, you have the right to make a formal complaint. Food is considered
unsafe/unsatisfactory when it:</p>
<ul><li>Results in you experiencing vomiting, diarrhoea or stomach pains </li>
  <li>Contains a foreign object, for example, glass, insects, hair </li>
  <li>Is contaminated by chemicals such as disinfectants or detergents </li>
  <li>Appears to be contaminated in some way - this may be noticed by a bad
    taste or smell </li>
</ul><p>In addition, you can also make a complaint if you are unhappy with the
hygiene standard in a food premises, e.g., supermarket, restaurant, etc. </p>

<h3>If you suspect that there is something wrong with the food you have been
served or purchased</h3>

<h3>When eating out:</h3>
<ul><li>Do not accept an unsatisfactory meal in a restaurant or café – send it
    back, leave or ask for an entirely fresh serving on a clean plate </li>
  <li>Always remember that hot food must be served piping <span>hot</span> </li>
</ul><h3>From take-aways</h3>

<p>Store the affected food in a sealed container in the fridge until it is
examined by the authorities. </p>

<h3>Purchased products</h3>
<ul><li>Make a note of when and where the food was purchased, when the food was
    first opened and when the problem was first noticed </li>
  <li>Keep the food product in the fridge or freezer, cover it and store it
    away from other food </li>
  <li>Do not remove any foreign objects from the food product </li>
  <li>Keep all the labels and packaging from the food product </li>
</ul></div>

<h3>Analysis of food samples</h3>

<p>The Public Analyst Laboratory provides analysis of food samples if there is
a complaint. There is no charge for this if a food complaint is submitted
through the Environmental Health Service Offices. There is a fee for food
sample analysis if you submit samples directly to the laboratory.</p>

<p>If you have a complaint regarding food or a food premises, you should

result. On the other hand, you can have suspect food analysed independently by

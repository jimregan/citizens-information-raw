<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span xml:lang="EN-IE" lang="EN-IE">If you are suffering
from a mental disorder, you may go into a psychiatric hospital or unit
voluntarily, or you may be committed as an involuntary patient. The vast
majority of admissions are voluntary – this means that you freely agree to go
for treatment. Voluntary psychiatric patients are not completely free to leave
psychiatric care and may be detained for a period and may then be involuntarily
detained. There are detailed rules about the detention of patients
involuntarily. </span></p>
</div>

<p><span xml:lang="EN-IE" lang="EN-IE">The rules about admission to psychiatric
hospitals or units are set out in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.mhcirl.ie/for_the_public/GuideMHA2001/">Mental Health Act
2001</a>. These rules apply in the same way to public and private psychiatric
facilities. The Act requires that psychiatric hospitals and units be registered
as <a href="http://www.mhcirl.ie/Registration/ACRegister">approved psychiatric
centres</a>. </span><span xml:lang="EN-IE" lang="EN-IE"></span></p>

<h3><span xml:lang="EN-IE" lang="EN-IE">Your best interests</span></h3>

<p><span xml:lang="EN-IE" lang="EN-IE">Under the Mental Health Act 2001, when
people are admitted or are receiving treatment in approved centres (that is,
psychiatric hospitals or inpatient services), their best interests should be
considered before any decision about their care and treatment is made. They
should be included in discussions with their care team about where their best
interests lie to help them with their recovery. Patients have the right to be
treated with dignity and respect and the right to be listened to by all those
working on their care team. They are entitled to take part in decisions that
affect their health and their care team should consider their views carefully.
They have the right to be fully informed about their legal rights, their
admission and treatment.</span><span xml:lang="EN-IE" lang="EN-IE"></span></p>

<p><span xml:lang="EN-IE" lang="EN-IE">You can read more in this <a href="http://www.mhcirl.ie/for_the_public/GuideMHA2001/">guide to the Mental

law.</span><br></p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l31fb4">Voluntary admission </h2>

<p>Voluntary admission to a psychiatric hospital or unit occurs in much the
same way as admission to a general hospital. Referral may be made by your GP or
consultant. Unlike patients in general hospitals, you are not always completely
free to leave psychiatric care when you wish. </p>

<p>If you are a voluntary patient who wants to leave a psychiatric centre and the
consultant psychiatrist or a doctor or nurse on the staff considers that you
are suffering from a mental disorder, the professional may detain you for a
maximum of 24 hours. If the voluntary patient is a child and the parents or
guardian want to remove them, the professional may have the child detained and
placed in the custody of the Health Service Executive (if the professional
considers that the child is suffering from a mental disorder). </p>

<p>After 24 hours, the consultant psychiatrist must then either discharge you
or arrange for an examination by another consultant psychiatrist. The second
consultant must issue a certificate stating that you should be detained because
of a mental disorder or must discharge you. If you are detained, then you are
an involuntary patient and all the procedures relating to information, review
and appeal apply in the usual way. You can read more in our document on the <a shape="rect" href="rights_of_psychiatric_patients.html">rights of psychiatric
patients</a>. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates"><h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="ld8cc2">Involuntary admission</h2>


<p>Under the Mental Health Act 2001, you may be involuntarily admitted and
detained in an approved psychiatric centre if you are suffering from a mental
disorder. You may not be admitted purely because you are suffering from a
personality disorder, are socially deviant or addicted to drugs or intoxicants.
</p>

<h3>Mental disorder</h3>

<p>The Act defines mental disorder as mental illness, severe dementia or
significant intellectual disability where: <br></p>
<ul><li>Because of the illness, disability or dementia, there is a serious
    likelihood that you may cause immediate and serious harm to yourself or to
    other people or </li>
  <li>Because of the severity of the illness, disability or dementia, your
    judgement is so impaired that your condition could get worse if you were
    not admitted to hospital for treatment that could only be given to you in
    hospital and going into hospital would be likely to improve your mental
    health significantly<br></li>
</ul><p><em>Mental illness</em> means a state of mind which affects your thinking,
perceiving, emotion or judgment and which seriously impairs your mental
function to the extent that you require care or medical treatment in your own
interest or in the interest of other people. <br><br><em>Severe dementia</em> means a deterioration of the brain which significantly
impairs your intellectual function and affects thought, comprehension and
memory and which includes severe psychiatric or behavioural symptoms such as
physical aggression. <br><br><em>Significant intellectual disability’</em> means a state of arrested or
incomplete development of the mind which includes significant impairment of
intelligence and social functioning and abnormally aggressive or seriously
irresponsible conduct. <br></p>

<h3>Application for involuntary admission </h3>

<p>An application for the involuntary admission of an adult may be made to a
registered medical practitioner by a spouse, civil partner or relative, an
authorised officer, a Garda or any other person. An authorised officer is an
officer of the Health Service Executive (HSE) who is designated by the Chief
Executive Officer of the HSE for the purposes of making such applications. This
does does not include a separated spouse or civil partner or one against whom
an application or order under the Domestic Violence Act has been made. </p>

<p>The following people may not make an application:</p>
<ul><li>Anyone aged under 18</li>
  <li>An authorised officer or Garda who is a relative of the person concerned
    or that person's spouse</li>
  <li>A member of the governing body (not including a member of the HSE) or
    staff of the approved centre concerned</li>
  <li>Anyone who has an interest in the payments to be made to the approved
    centre</li>
  <li>Any medical practitioner who provides a regular medical service to the
    centre</li>
  <li>The spouse, parent or other close relative of any of the people
    specifically mentioned above.</li>
</ul><p>The person applying musrt have seen the person whose admission is sought
within the 48 hours prior to making the application. If the application is
being made by 'any other person', the application must include a statement of
the reasons why it is being made, the connection of the applicant to the person
whose admission is proposed and the circumstances in which the application is
made. </p>

<h3>Role of the Gardaí </h3>

<p>If a Garda has reasonable grounds for believing that a person is suffering
from a mental disorder and that, because of the disorder, there is a serious
likelihood of the person causing immediate and serious harm to themselves or
another person, the Garda may take the person into custody. If necessary, the
Garda may use force to enter the premises where it is believed that the person
is. The Garda must then go through the normal application procedure for
involuntary detention in an approved centre. If the Garda's application is
refused, the person must be released immediately. If the application is
granted, the Garda must remove the person to the approved centre. </p>

<h3>Medical assessment </h3>

<p>If it is proposed that you be involuntarily admitted to an approved centre,
you must be examined by a medical practitioner (who is not a relative and is
not involved with an approved centre) within 24 hours of the making of an
application. The doctor must tell you the purpose of the examination unless
they consider that such information would prejudice your mental health, well
being or emotional condition. </p>

<p>If the doctor considers that you are suffering from a mental disorder, they
make a recommendation that you be involuntarily admitted to an approved centre
(other than the Central Mental Hospital). This recommendation remains in force
for 7 days. If the application is refused and a subsequent application is made,
the applicant is obliged to inform the doctor about the previous application,
if aware of it. </p>

<h3>Removal to an approved centre</h3>

<p>In general, the applicant is responsible for taking the person to the
centre. If this is not possible, then the doctor who made the recommendation
may ask the clinical director of the centre or a consultant psychiatrist acting
on their behalf to arrange for the person to be brought to the centre by the
staff. If necessary, the Gardai may be asked to help. In this situation, the
Gardai have the power to enter premises by force and may detain or restrain the
patient if necessary. </p>


<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l471e3">Admission to an approved psychiatric centre</h2>


<p>When you are received at an approved psychiatric centre, you must be
examined by a consultant psychiatrist on the staff. You may be detained for a
maximum of 24 hours in the centre for this examination. If the psychiatrist is
satisfied that you are suffering from a mental disorder, they then make an
admission order. If the psychiatrist is not satisfied that you are suffering
from a mental disorder, you must be released immediately. The admission order
is valid for 21 days. It authorises your reception, detention and treatment in
the centre for this period. </p>

<p>A renewal order may extend this period by a further 3 months. This must be
made by the consultant psychiatrist responsible and they must have examined you
in the week before making the order. A further renewal order may be made by the
same psychiatrist for a period of 6 months and subsequently for 12 months at a
time. </p>

<p>There are provisions for the review of all admission orders. You can read more
in our document on the <a shape="rect" href="rights_of_psychiatric_patients.html">rights of psychiatric patients</a>.

<p>The HSE may apply for the involuntary admission of a child who is suffering
from a mental disorder. Such an application must be made to the District Court.
The court will order a psychiatric examination and may then make an order that
the child be admitted to an approved centre for a maximum of 21 days, which may
be extended. Specific approval by the court is required if it is proposed to
carry out psycho-surgery or electro-convulsive therapy on a child with a mental
disorder.

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lb09df">Complaints</h2>
If you have a complaint about a mental health service, you should in the first
instance contact the service provider who is required by law to have a clear
complaints procedure in place under Article 31 of the Mental Health Act 2001
(Approved Centres) Regulations 2006. 

<p>If you contact any member of staff of the Mental Health Commission in
relation to a complaint, you will be advised to contact the service provider as
the Mental Health Commission does not handle individual complaints.</p>

<p>If you contact the Mental Health Commission in relation to a concern about a
service, you will be directed to the Inspectorate of Mental Health Services if
appropriate.</p>

<p>The Inspectorate logs all concerns that relates to mental health services
and these are taken into account on inspections.</p>

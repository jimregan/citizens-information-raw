<h2>Information</h2>


<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2001/act/25/enacted/en/html">Mental
Health Act 2001</a> changed the rules about admission to psychiatric hospitals
and the rights of psychiatric patients. Since the Act was implemented on 1
November 2006, new procedures have been put in place for the monitoring and
regulation of standards of care in psychiatric hospitals.<br></p>

<h2>Best interests of the patient
</h2>

<p>When people are admitted or are receiving treatment in approved centres
(that is, psychiatric hospitals or inpatient services), their best interests
should be considered before any decision about their care and treatment is
made. They should be included in discussions with their care team about where
their best interests lie to help them with their recovery. Patients have the
right to be treated with dignity and respect and the right to be listened to by
all those working on their care team. They are entitled to take part in
decisions that affect their health and their care team should consider their
views carefully. They have the right to be fully informed about their legal
rights, their admission and treatment.</p>

<h2>Mental Health Commission </h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="mental_health_commission.html">Mental Health
Commission</a> has been in existence since 2002. Its main functions are:</p>
<ul><li>To promote, encourage and foster high standards and good practices in the
    delivery of mental health services and </li>
  <li> To protect the interests of people who have been involuntarily admitted
    to an approved centre<br></li>
</ul><p>It is responsible for implementing the provisions of the Act in relation to
involuntary admission, for setting up mental health tribunals and ensuring that
the rights of patients are respected. It has drawn up the forms necessary for
the various processes and issued guidelines for people involved in the mental
health system. </p>

<p>The Mental Health Commission has published a <a href="http://www.mhcirl.ie/for_the_public/GuideMHA2001/">guide to the Mental
Health Act 2001 which is available in English, Irish, Arabic, Chinese, French,
Polish and Russian.

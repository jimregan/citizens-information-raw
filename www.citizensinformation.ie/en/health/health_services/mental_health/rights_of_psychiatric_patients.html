<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Mental Health Act 2001 provides for, among other things, rules about <a shape="rect" href="admission_to_a_psychiatric_hospital.html">admission to
psychiatric hospitals</a> and rules about the rights of psychiatric patients.
</p>

<p>If you are involuntarily admitted to an <a shape="rect" href="http://www.mhcirl.ie/Registration/ACRegister">approved psychiatric
centre</a>, you are entitled to: <br></p>
<ul><li>Have all decisions made in your best interests </li>
  <li>Be examined by a psychiatrist in the centre </li>
  <li>Be provided with certain information</li>
  <li>Have your retention reviewed by a tribunal</li>
  <li>Appeal to the Courts in certain circumstances <br></li>
</ul><p>There are specific rules about psychiatric patients and their consent to
treatment. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Your best interests </h3>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="mental_health_act_2001.html">Mental Health
Act 2001</a>, when people are admitted or are receiving treatment in approved
centres (that is, psychiatric hospitals or inpatient services), their best
interests should be considered before any decision about their care and
treatment is made. Patients have the right to be treated with dignity and
respect and the right to be listened to by all those working on their care
team. They should be included in discussions with their care team. They are
entitled to take part in decisions that affect their health and their care team
should consider their views carefully. They have the right to be fully informed
about their legal rights, their admission and treatment.</p>

<h3>Admission to an approved psychiatric centre </h3>

<p>When you are received at an approved psychiatric centre, you must be
examined by a consultant psychiatrist on the staff. You may be detained for a
maximum of 24 hours in the centre for this examination. If the psychiatrist is
satisfied that you are suffering from a mental disorder, they then make an
admission order. If the psychiatrist is not satisfied that you are suffering
from a mental disorder, you must be released immediately. The admission order
is valid for 21 days. It authorises your reception, detention and treatment in
the centre for this period. </p>

<p>A renewal order may extend this period by a further 3 months. This must be
made by the consultant psychiatrist responsible and they must have examined you
in the week before making the order. A further renewal order may be made by the
same psychiatrist for a period of 6 months and subsequently for 12 months at a
time. </p>

<h3>Your right to information</h3>

<p>Each time an admission order or a renewal order is made, a copy must be
given to the <a href="mental_health_commission.html">Mental Health
Commission</a> and a notice in writing must be given to the patient. The notice
to you, the patient, must include the following information:</p>
<ul><li>You are being detained under the Mental Health Act and the relevant
    section</li>
  <li>You are entitled to legal representation </li>
  <li>You will be given a general description of the treatment recommended for
    you during the detention </li>
  <li>You are entitled to communicate with the <a shape="rect" href="inspector_of_mental_health_services.html">Inspector of Mental Health
    Services</a> </li>
  <li>You will have the detention reviewed by a mental health tribunal</li>
  <li>You are entitled to appeal to the Circuit Court against a decision of a
    tribunal </li>
  <li>You may be admitted as a voluntary patient if you wish.</li>
</ul><h3>Review of admission by a mental health tribunal </h3>

<p>When the Mental Health Commission receives a copy of an admission or renewal
order, it must <br></p>
<ul><li>Refer the matter to a mental health tribunal </li>
  <li>Assign a legal representative to represent you unless you personally
    engage one </li>
  <li>Arrange for another consultant psychiatrist to examine you, interview the
    consultant responsible for your treatment and care and review your records
    in order to decide whether you are suffering from a mental disorder. The
    tribunal's report must be given within 14 days to the Commission and to
    your legal representative.<br></li>
</ul><p>The tribunal must review your detention and make a decision within 21 days
of the making of the order (there are provisions for extending this time
limit). If it is satisfied that you are suffering from a mental disorder and
that the proper procedures have been followed (or, if they have not, the
failure does not affect the substance of the order and does not cause an
injustice) then it affirms the order. If it is not satisfied, it revokes the
order and directs that you be discharged.</p>

<p>The tribunal has similar powers to a court, including the power to require
the attendance of the relevant people and the production of documents. The
tribunal is, of course, obliged to respect the usual requirements of natural
justice, for example, it must ensure that you have copies of the reports that
are being considered by the tribunal. </p>

<p>The tribunal must notify its decision, in writing, to <br></p>
<ul><li>The Mental Health Commission </li>
  <li>The psychiatrist responsible for your care and treatment </li>
  <li>You and your legal representative</li>
  <li>Any other person the tribunal considers should be notified.</li>
</ul><p>The tribunal is appointed by the Mental Health Commission. It must consist
of a lawyer as chairman, a consultant psychiatrist and a lay person (a person
who is not a lawyer or doctor). Tribunal members have been selected and trained
by the Mental Health Commission.</p>

<h3>Appeal to the Circuit Court </h3>

<p>You may appeal to the Circuit Court (within 14 days) against a decision to
affirm an order. At this stage, it is up to you, the patient, to prove your
case that you are not suffering from a mental disorder. </p>

<h3>Civil proceedings generally </h3>

<p>There are certain restrictions on taking civil actions in court arising from
actions taken under the Mental Health Act. You need to get the permission of
the High Court before taking civil proceedings in respect of any act done in
carrying out the functions of the Mental Health Act. The High Court must not
refuse such permission unless it is satisfied that the proceedings are either
frivolous or vexatious or that there are no reasonable grounds for contending
that the person against whom the proceedings are brought acted in bad faith or
without reasonable care. The court is not allowed to determine the proceedings
in favour of the patient unless it is satisfied that the person against whom
the proceedings are brought acted in bad faith or without reasonable care. </p>

<h3>Consent to psychiatric treatment </h3>

<p>In general, medical and surgical treatment may be administered only with the
informed consent of the patient. The law is different in the case of
psychiatric patients.</p>

<p>For the purposes of the Mental Health Act 2001, consent means consent in
writing, obtained freely without threats or inducements, where:</p>
<ul><li>The consultant psychiatrist who is caring for you certifies that you are
    capable of understanding the nature, purpose and likely effects of the
    proposed treatment and </li>
  <li>The psychiatrist has given you adequate information, in a form and a
    language that you can understand, on the nature, purpose and likely effects
    of the proposed treatment. </li>
</ul><p>Under the Act, your consent to treatment is required except where the
consultant psychiatrist considers that the treatment is necessary to safeguard
your life, to restore your health, to alleviate your condition or to relieve
your suffering, and you are incapable of giving such consent because of your
mental disorder.</p>

<p>Psycho-surgery may not be performed unless you consent and it is authorised
by a mental health tribunal. </p>

<p>Electro-convulsive therapy may not be performed unless you give consent or
where you are unable to give consent and the therapy is authorised by the
consultant psychiatrist responsible for you and by another consultant
psychiatrist. </p>

<p>If you are getting medicine for the amelioration of the mental disorder for
a period of 3 months, the medicine must be discontinued unless you consent or,
where you are unable to give consent, the continued medication is authorised by
the consultant psychiatrist responsible for you and by another consultant
psychiatrist. </p>

<h3>Restraint </h3>

<p>Patients may not be restrained or placed in seclusion unless this is
necessary for treatment or to prevent the patients from injuring themselves.
The Commission has made <a href="http://www.mhcirl.ie/for_H_Prof/Mental_Health_Commission_Rules/Seclusion_and_Mechanical_Restraint/">rules
for the use of seclusion and mechanical means of bodily restraint.</a> There is
a <a href="http://www.mhcirl.ie/for_H_Prof/codemha2001/Use_of_Physical_Restraint/">Code
of Practice on the use of Physical Restraint in Approved Centres</a>. </p>

<h3>Clinical trials </h3>

<p>People who are suffering from a mental disorder and who have been admitted
to an approved centre may not take part in clinical trials. </p>

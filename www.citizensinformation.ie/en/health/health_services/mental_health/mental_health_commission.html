<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lb9ff6">Mental health tribunals</h2>

<p>The Mental Health Commission appoints mental health tribunals to
automatically review all decisions to involuntarily detain patients or to
extend the duration of such detentions under the provisions of the Mental
Health Act, 2001. A mental health tribunal is a group of 3 people who review a
personâ€™s involuntary admission.</p>

<p>When the Mental Health Commission receives a copy of an admission or renewal
order, it must: </p>
<ul><li>Refer the matter to a mental health tribunal </li>
  <li>Assign a legal representative to represent the patient unless the patient
    personally engages one </li>
  <li>Arrange for a consultant psychiatrist to examine the patient; interview
    the consultant psychiatrist responsible for the patient's treatment and
    care; and review the patient's records in order to decide, in the interests
    of the patient, whether the patient is suffering from a mental disorder.
    The report must be presented by the consultant psychiatrist to the tribunal
    and to the patient's legal representative, within 14 days </li>
</ul><p>The mental health tribunal must review the detention of the patient and make
a decision within 21 days of the making of the order. If the tribunal is
satisfied that the patient is suffering from a mental disorder and that the
proper procedures have been followed (or, if they have not, the failure does
not affect the substance of the order and does not cause an injustice), it
affirms the order. If it is not satisfied, it revokes the order and directs
that the patient be discharged. </p>

<p>In order to carry out its functions, the tribunal has similar powers to a
court, including the power to require the attendance of the relevant people and
the production of documents. The tribunal is, of course, obliged to respect the
usual requirements of natural justice, for example, it must ensure that the
patient has copies of the reports that are being considered by the tribunal.</p>

<p>The tribunal must notify its decision, in writing, to:</p>
<ul><li>The Mental Health Commission </li>
  <li>The psychiatrist responsible for the patient's care and treatment </li>
  <li>The patient and their legal representative </li>
  <li>Any other person the tribunal considers should have notice. </li>
</ul><p>The review tribunal must consist of a lawyer as chairman, a consultant
psychiatrist and a person who is not a lawyer or doctor. Members of the
Commission may not serve on a tribunal.</p>

<p>A further function of the tribunals, under the direction of the Mental
Health Commission, is to consider any request for authorisation from a
consultant psychiatrist to perform psycho-surgery on a patient where the
patient gives their consent in writing to such treatment. If the tribunal is
satisfied that such surgery is in the best interests of the person, it will
authorise such surgery or where it is not so satisfied, refuse it.</p>

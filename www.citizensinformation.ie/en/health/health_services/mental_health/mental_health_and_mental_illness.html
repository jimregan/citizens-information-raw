<p>If you have a mental illness, your entitlement to care and treatment is the
same as if you are suffering from other illness. You have the same <a shape="rect" href="../entitlement_to_health_services/entitlement_to_public_health_services.html">entitlement
to general health services</a> and to <a shape="rect" href="../care_in_your_community/">community care services</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="mental_health_commission.html">Mental Health Commission</a>,
has, among other things, overall responsibility for the standards of mental
health services. The <a shape="rect" href="inspector_of_mental_health_services.html">Inspector of Mental Health
Services</a> carries out inspections of mental health facilities. </p>

<p>The overall aim of mental health services policy is to provide care in the
community as far as is possible. There are specific <a shape="rect" href="mental_health_professionals.html">mental health professionals</a> who
specialise in the provision of <a href="mental_health_services.html">mental
health services</a>. </p>

<p>In-patient services for people with mental illness are provided in approved
psychiatric centres. These are mainly psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric
units in general hospitals. </p>

<p>The rules about <a href="admission_to_a_psychiatric_hospital.html">admission to approved
centres</a> are set out in the <a shape="rect" href="mental_health_act_2001.html">Mental Health Act 2001</a>. This Act also
sets of the <a shape="rect" href="rights_of_psychiatric_patients.html">rights
of psychiatric patients</a>.</p>

<p>The Mental Health Commission has published a booklet, <a href="http://www.mhcirl.ie/for_the_public/GuideMHA2001/">Your Guide to the
Mental Health Act 2001</a>, that explains your rights under mental health
law.</p>

<p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has an information booklet <a href="http://hse.ie/eng/services/publications/Mentalhealth/The_Journey_Together_-_Carers_Handbook.pdf">The
Journey Together (pdf)</a> for families and friends who support people
experiencing mental health problems.</p>

<p>Mental health services use a multidisciplinary approach, where a number of
professionals offer their particular skills in a co-ordinated and complementary
way. </p>

<h3>Family doctor (GP)</h3>

<p>Your GP is often the first person you will seek help from. He/she will
assess the problem and may either provide medication and monitor your condition
or may refer you to a specialist, for example, psychiatrist, psychologist or
counsellor, if necessary. Your GP may be able to recommend a support group for
the particular problem. Where others are involved in the patient's care (for
example, psychiatrist, social worker, family members, etc.) your GP may liaise
with them in order to provide you with the best overall care. </p>

<h3>Psychiatrist</h3>

<p>A psychiatrist is a medical doctor that specialises in mental health.
Psychiatrists are responsible for the medical care of psychiatric patients
(medication, physical symptoms, etc.) and are also involved in counselling. A
psychiatrist usually works in a psychiatric hospital or unit or as part of a
community care team but he or she can also be part of a private practice. In
most cases, your GP will refer you to a psychiatrist if he or she considers it
necessary or if you request a referral. A psychiatrist will assess the person,
usually at a hospital out-patient clinic, form a diagnosis and treat the person
accordingly. This may involve treatment with medication or referral to a member
of the mental health team. If a psychiatrist thinks it necessary, he or she may
suggest that a patient be admitted to hospital. This suggestion is generally
only made if a person's difficulties are severe. </p>

<h3>Psychologist</h3>

<p>A psychologist is trained in the study of human behaviour and tries to
explain feelings, thoughts and behaviour. Psychologists can provide assessment
and treatment of a psychological nature that includes personality assessment
through a structured interview, assessment of a wide range of psychological
problems – anxiety, depression, self esteem issues, psycho-sexual and marital
problems. They can also help patients examine the effects their illness is
having on their lives and methods of coping with those effects. Bringing a
patient closer to an understanding of his or her illness is a key aim of a
psychologist. When involved in the area of mental health, the psychologist
usually works as a clinical, community or counselling psychologist, and unless
also medically qualified, does not prescribe medication. </p>

<h3>Clinical psychologist</h3>

<p>The clinical psychologist has a specialist qualification in mental health
and works as part of the mental health team in a unit or hospital and is
involved in assessment and counselling therapy. Family therapy may be provided
where appropriate and a particular approach may be used for specific problems,
such as a cognitive-behavioural approach for phobias. Referral is often through
a GP or psychiatrist, but self-referral is possible. </p>

<h3>Community psychologist</h3>

<p>The community psychologist has a clinical qualification and works as part of
a community-based team with individuals such as social workers, speech
therapists and community welfare officers. The community psychologist is
involved in assessing and working with those with a wide range of problems,
including children with behavioural, educational and other difficulties. </p>

<h3>Counselling psychologist</h3>

<p>Counselling psychology, as a specialist area, encompasses a broad range of
practices that help people improve their well being, alleviate distress and
maladjustment, resolve crises, and increase their ability to live more highly
functioning lives. Counselling psychologists can be found working in diverse
areas such as schools and colleges, industrial workplaces and health services.
</p>

<h3>Behavioural therapist</h3>

<p>Behavioural therapy works on the premise that you can change what people do
by teaching them to respond to things in a different way. Behavioural therapy
aims to help the patient control undesirable habits or irrational fears and can
be used in the treatment of behavioural conditions like eating disorders and
phobias. In many cases, behaviours can be learned or unlearned through basic
conditioning techniques. Behavioural therapy uses such techniques as aversive
conditioning, where unwanted habits are paired with unpleasant stimuli, and
systematic desensitisation, where a stimulus that causes anxiety is paired with
a pleasant one. Some behavioural therapists may also be psychiatrists or
psychologists but this is not necessarily the case. They may be people like
psychiatric nurses or social workers who have received the relevant training to
work in this area. While this kind of therapy is frequently used in the
treatment of behaviour disorders, it may not be available in all regions. </p>

<h3>Cognitive behavioural therapist</h3>

<p>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) aims to reduce dysfunctional emotions
and behaviour by changing behaviour and thinking patterns. Professionals who
specialise in this kind of therapy believe that a change in symptoms and
behaviour follows a change in thinking. This change can be brought about in a
number of ways, including the practice of new behaviours and analysis of faulty
thinking patterns. The purpose of CBT is to reduce distress or unwanted
behaviour by undoing this learning or by providing new, more adaptive learning.
Again, cognitive behavioural therapists may not all be psychologists or
psychiatrists and you should check with your Health Service Executive (HSE)
Area to see if the service is available in your area. </p>

<h3>Counsellor</h3>

<p>There are many forms of counselling available for a wide range of problems
and many counsellors specialise in particular areas such as addiction or
bereavement. All approaches emphasise non-judgemental, attentive listening and
respect for the client. Counselling aims to enable people to take control of
their own lives, and the counsellor may not adhere to one particular theory.
Self-referral is the usual route to counselling, although a GP, psychiatrist or
trusted friend may be able to recommend someone suitable. Some counsellors are
qualified psychologists, but many are not. Those who are not may have a basic
degree or training in other areas and/or relevant work experience (for example,
teaching, nursing, etc.) plus a counselling qualification. These qualifications
can vary from Masters degrees to short-term courses. It is important to make
sure you are happy with the training and qualifications of any counsellor that
you choose. Counselling is often one session per week and tends to be
short-term rather than longer-term, although this can vary.</p>

<h3>Addiction counsellor</h3>

<p>Addiction counsellors provide assessment, counselling, information and
treatment services for people suffering from alcohol, drugs and gambling
addictions. Before receiving counselling for addiction, a patient must go
through a detoxification programme, if necessary. The patient is then referred
to the community-based addiction treatment service. An individual and group
counselling approach is commonly used with an emphasis on the consequences of
the addict's behaviour. The main aspect of treatment examines the triggering
factors that lead to the development of the addiction. Target goals are set to
try and establish new patterns of healthy behaviour. An important part of the
treatment is the involvement of a family member, which can help to achieve
these targets. The programme lasts for an average of six to eight weeks and is
followed by an after care service.</p>

<h3>Psychotherapist</h3>

<p>Psychotherapy tends to be more in-depth than counselling. It is based on the
idea that the less aware we are of our motives, feelings and actions, the more
they control us and the more we stay stuck in old patterns that may be harmful
to us. A psychotherapist can help patients to examine their subconscious mind.
By bringing any unconscious motives, fears and feelings to light and dealing
with them, patients can often get relief from their symptoms. Psychotherapists
usually undertake a long postgraduate training that requires trainees to
undergo therapy, often twice per week, for several years. The techniques and
interventions used by the psychotherapist vary according to the theoretical
framework within which he or she is working. </p>

<h3>Psychiatric nurse</h3>

<p>The psychiatric nurse plays a central role in the care of the psychiatric
patient, both in a hospital setting and in the community. He or she works
within a psychiatric service as part of a health care team. Nurses provide both
physical and psychological care to their patients and can also provide
essential support and encouragement to the patients' families. The nurse's
activities are varied but can include:</p>
<ul><li>Day patient care </li>
  <li>Detoxification programmes </li>
  <li>Education of student nurses and community groups </li>
  <li>Family education and support </li>
  <li>Group therapies, individual counselling </li>
  <li>Acting as a liaison with in-patient services, GPs, strategy and voluntary
    organisations </li>
  <li>Organisation of admissions to hospital and reception </li>
  <li>Initial assessment of referrals from GPs </li>
</ul><p>The community psychiatric nurse usually follows up patients on discharge
from hospital, calling to their homes and attending out-patients' clinics and
day care centres. Community psychiatric nurses are now becoming involved in
patients' rehousing needs. </p>

<h3>Mental health social worker</h3>

<p>Mental health social workers carry out a range of functions as members of a
multi-disciplinary team. Individual counselling is one of their key tasks in
assisting those with a variety of emotional difficulties. Another key function
is 'psycho-education'. Psycho-education refers to work with individuals and
their families to explain aspects of the mental illness. Psycho-education also
involves offering coping strategies appropriate to the specific mental illness.
Given that mental health service provision is sometimes fragmented, mental
health social workers are committed to 'case management' or 'care management'.
This refers to working with individuals with a view to ensuring continuity of
care and the co-ordination of services. This helps to maximise their wellbeing
and quality of life. Case management involves the integration of health
services with a range of other services. Examples include, housing, social
welfare, job training and employment, liaison with statutory and voluntary
agenices, etc. All of these links may contribute to positive mental health. </p>

<h3>Occupational therapist</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../care_in_your_community/occupational_therapy_services.html">Occupational
therapists</a> provide services to people whose ability to cope with everyday
activities is threatened or impaired in some way by physical, psychological or
developmental problems. Occupational therapists can assess and treat anyone
(adult or child) who has practical difficulties due to mental illness,
accidental injury, arthritis, cerebral palsy, learning difficulties, stroke,
and other congenital, developmental, degenerative or neurological conditions.
Occupational therapy aims to enable the person to have as independent,
productive and satisfying a lifestyle as possible. Treatment can include self
care, personal development, mobility and access, skills and training, home
management, disability awareness, work preparation, directed play, stress
management and compensatory techniques. </p>

<h3>Vocational supports trainer </h3>

<p>Vocational training is a service provided for people whose lives have been
disrupted by mental health problems and who wish to make a fresh start. It aims
to provide participants with the skills, knowledge and attitudes necessary for
progression into employment, further training, education, and self-employment.
It also aims to provide participants with other work opportunities, the
opportunity to rebuild self-confidence and restore self-worth and the
opportunity to make new friends and develop hobbies and pastimes. A Vocational
Training Centre provides activities such as woodwork, metalwork, office
procedures, arts and crafts and life skills (for example, interpersonal skills
and personal development). An individual programme is agreed with each trainee.
Referral is usually through a professional such as a psychiatrist, but
self-referral is also possible. While some trainers are mental health
professionals, such as psychiatric nurses, others may not have specific medical
training. </p>

<p>You do not have to pay to use the services of mental health professionals
who work in the public health system. If you decide to use private mental
health professional services, the cost will vary greatly. You should check with
the individuals involved for more details. </p>

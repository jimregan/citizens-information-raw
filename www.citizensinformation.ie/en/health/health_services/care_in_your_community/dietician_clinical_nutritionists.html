<p>A dietitian (also known as a clinical nutritionist) is a health professional
who is qualified to give accurate advice and information on all aspects of
nutrition and diet. Dietitians apply knowledge of food, nutrition and other
related disciplines such as biochemistry, physiology and social science to
promote health, prevent disease and aid in the management of illness. </p>

<p>You may see a dietitian in a hospital (as an inpatient or outpatient) or in
the community (at a clinic or in a care centre). Dietetic services may be
accessed on a public or private basis.</p>

<p>Dietitians are <a href="registration_of_health_and_social_care_professionals.html">registered
by CORU</a>. </p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Dietetic services are available free of charge through the public health
service. However, availability may vary in different areas of the <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health_service_agencies/health_boards.html">Health

<p>If you access services privately, you will be charged for the service. You
may be able to reclaim costs if you have <a href="../health_insurance/private_health_insurance.html">private health

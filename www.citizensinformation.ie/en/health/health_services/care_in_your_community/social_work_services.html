<p>Child welfare and protection services (including family support services)
that were previously operated by the Health Service Executive have transferred
to <a href="../../birth_family_relationships/family_support_agency.html">Tusla</a>,
which was established on 1 January 2014. </p>

<p>The HSE may provide social work services for other groups or individuals.
Social work services are delivered by teams of social workers, working with
individuals and groups experiencing social and emotional difficulties. The aim
of social work is to help people achieve change and make decisions which will
improve their quality of life. It is also a function of social work to identify
options and support steps to advance social policy and service delivery.</p>

<p>Most public hospitals employ social workers whose main task is to help
people when they leave the hospital. They may find suitable accommodation for
them, help them to find a <a shape="rect" href="../services_for_older_people/regulation_residential_care_older_people.html">nursing
home</a> place or ensure that the necessary supports are in place if they
return home.</p>

<p>The availability of social workers varies considerably from one HSE area to
another. Some Local Health Offices employ social workers specifically to cater
for the needs of older people.</p>

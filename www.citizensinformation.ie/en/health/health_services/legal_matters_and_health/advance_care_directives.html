<p>An Advance Healthcare Directive, sometimes known as a 'Living will', is a
statement about the type and extent of medical or surgical treatment you want
in the future, on the assumption that you will not be able to make that
decision at the relevant time. There are a number of different words and
phrases used to describe advance care directives. In some countries, there is
legislation which provides for the recognition and enforcement of such
directives and in some cases provides for the way in which they should be made.
</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/64/enacted/en/html">Assisted
Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015</a> provides laws for Advance Healthcare
Directives. The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet
been commenced to bring it into effect. <a href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/downloads/relate/relate_2016_04.pdf">Read
more about the Act (pdf)</a>. This document describes the situation before the
Act comes into operation.</p>

<p>An Advance Healthcare Directive may be valid and enforceable because by
making such a statement you may have withdrawn your <a shape="rect" href="consent_to_medical_and_surgical_procedures.html">consent to specific
medical or surgical treatment</a>. It is not possible to state with absolute
certainty that such a directive would be enforced because this depends on
exactly what it says and whether or not it addresses the precise circumstances
you face. </p>

<p>In some countries it is possible to appoint someone else to make decisions
on your behalf if you are not capable of making them yourself. In Ireland this
power is granted by creating an <a shape="rect" href="/en/death/before_a_death/power_of_attorney.html">Enduring Power of
Attorney</a>. An Enduring Power of Attorney however specifically does not allow
for the making of healthcare decisions by another person. While you may suggest
to your doctor or hospital that the wishes of certain people may be taken into
account, you cannot give anyone else any legal right to make decisions about
your healthcare. Neither can you ensure that the doctor/hospital will abide by
their wishes.</p>

<h3>What is an Advance Healthcare Directive? </h3>

<p>In general it can be defined as a statement about the kind and extent of
medical or surgical treatment you want in the future, on the assumption that
you will not be able to make that decision at the relevant time. Sometimes the
terms living will, advance statement, advance decision or advance refusal are
used. Remember however, there are no precise definitions of these terms but
they are all advance decisions about medical or surgical treatment. People
usually make such directives to limit the treatment given in order not to
prolong life, for example, a Do Not Resuscitate Order. Some people however make
them in order to state that they want all possible treatments to be provided.
It is unlikely that such a directive would be enforceable as it does not take
account of the likely success of the treatment or of the costs involved. </p>

<p>There is no doubt that an advance directive is not enforceable if it
specifies doing something which is illegal. For example, an advance directive
stating that you want to be given medication which will hasten your death would
not be enforceable. Withdrawal of treatment is not the same as positive action
to end life. A directive which specifies the kind of treatment you want is
unlikely to be enforceable, especially if it conflicts with the doctor's
clinical decision. A directive is unlikely to be considered valid under
circumstances which clearly were not envisaged when it was drawn up.</p>

<h3>Family members and Advance Healthcare Directives</h3>

<p>If a healthcare issue arises and the patient is incapable of making a
decision, it is the practice to consult with next of kin. It is not clear what
legal basis there is for this, as next of kin have no general right to make
decisions on behalf of adults. </p>

<p>Medical ethics currently in force in Ireland state that consultation with
next of kin is desirable if the patient is unable to make a decision or to
communicate and provides for a second opinion if there is a difference of
opinion between your family and the doctor. </p>

<p>Next of kin are (in order) spouses, children, parents, siblings. Partners
have no legal status and may experience difficulties in seeing patients if
family members object. </p>

<h3>Medical ethics</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1978/en/act/pub/0004/sec0069.html#zza4y1978s69">Section
69(2) of the Medical Practitioners Act 1978</a> provides that the Irish Medical
Council is obliged to provide guidance to the medical profession in Ireland
regarding medical ethics. The Council have a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.medicalcouncil.ie/News-and-Publications/Reports/Guide-to-Professional-Conduct-Ethics-8th-Edition.html">Guide
to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners</a>.
</p>

<h3>Suicide and Assisted Suicide</h3>

<p>You are entitled to refuse medical treatment but this does not mean that you
may take positive measures to end your own life or another person's life. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0011/index.html">Criminal
Law (Suicide) Act 1993</a> sets out the law in relation to suicide. Suicide
itself or an attempt to commit suicide is not a crime. However, it is a
criminal offence to help another person to take measures to end their life. </p>

<p>It is a criminal offence to aid, abet, encourage or procure the suicide of
another person. That crime is usually referred to as assisted suicide. The
maximum penalty for assisted suicide is 14 years imprisonment. If you help
someone to commit suicide you may be charged with murder, manslaughter or
assisted suicide depending on the exact circumstances. Such a charge could
arise if you help another person to end their life even if the other person is
terminally ill or wants to end their life. This applies to medical
professionals in the same way as to other people.</p>

<p>Pain killing drugs which may also shorten life may be administered if the
intention is to deal with pain and not to end life.</p>

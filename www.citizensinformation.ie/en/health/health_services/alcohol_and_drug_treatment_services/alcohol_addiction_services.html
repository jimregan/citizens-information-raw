<p><a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO">Local Health Offices</a>
of the Health Service Executive (HSE) provide alcohol addiction services,
funded through the <a shape="rect" href="../how_health_is_organised/department_of_health_and_children.html">Department
of Health</a>. There are also a number of private programmes, which offer help
to those trying to combat the effects of alcohol addiction. </p>

<h3>Treatment options</h3>

<p>Alcohol addiction can be treated in a residential or non-residential
setting. It will depend on your circumstances and your own personal
preferences. Most people are treated in the community in non-residential
settings. Some of the treatment options available are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Addiction counselling</li>
  <li>Detoxification</li>
  <li>Medication</li>
  <li>Residential programmes</li>
  <li>Group support</li>
</ul><p>If you have a mental illness and alcoholism you can access your local mental
health services and they will also support you to access addiction services.
Depending on your treatment needs, you may be referred back to your GP for
continuous care.</p>

<p><strong>Addiction counselling</strong></p>

<p>Addiction counsellors provide assessment, counselling, information and
treatment services. Before receiving counselling you must go through a
detoxification programme, if necessary. You are then referred to the
community-based addiction treatment service. An individual and group
counselling approach is commonly used.</p>

<p>As well as addiction counselling, community care services may run other
alcohol-related courses. Family therapy, couples therapy, and groups for
concerned persons will address the issues that problem drinking can bring up in
these particular relationships.</p>

<p><strong>Detoxification</strong></p>

<p>Detoxification removes the physical craving for alcohol that is a symptom of
alcohol addiction. Detoxification can take place on an out-patient basis under
the supervision of a GP. A reducing dose of a strong anti-anxiety drug, will be
prescribed to ease the effects of alcohol withdrawal. Detoxification does not
deal with the psychological issues that cause a person to abuse alcohol. For a
successful outcome, people usually have to go through counselling to understand
their addiction and change their behaviour patterns. Your GP can talk to you
about a suitable detoxification programme.</p>

<p><strong>Use of prescribed drugs to treat alcohol addiction</strong></p>

<p>In some cases, medication may be prescribed to help them in the initial
stages of treatment. The use of drugs to treat addiction is called
pharmocotherapy and most of the commonly used drugs will be covered by the <a href="../entitlement_to_health_services/drugs_payment_scheme.html">Drugs
Payment Scheme</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Residential programmes</strong></p>

<p>Residential treatment takes the client away from their usual environment and
all sources of alcohol. Patients are weaned off their dependence on alcohol and
begin a therapy programme, Age limits can vary depending on the programme. Some
programmes are designed to deal with people as young as 15, while others may
only accept over 18s. Programmes will generally have a small number of
participants The costs of residential programmes vary. Depending on the
programmes, the costs may be covered by a medical card. To find out if there is
a charge, you should contact the treatment centre directly. If you donâ€™t have
a medical card you can request approval for funding from your Local Health
Office. The Manager of Community Services will make a decision on your
request.</p>

<p><strong>Group meetings for those affected by alcohol abuse</strong></p>

<p>Group meetings like <a href="http://www.alcoholicsanonymous.ie/">Alcoholics
Anonymous</a> are run independently of the HSE, although meetings may take
place on HSE premises. There are other groups that provide support to those
affected by someone's problem drinking. Privately run groups are generally free
of charge.</p>

<p><strong>Private treatment services</strong></p>

<p>There are a number of private treatment services for alcohol addiction. The
services they provide are very similar to those provided by the HSE. You will
have a choice of residential treatment or treatment as an out-patient. Private
treatment programmes are not free of charge and prices will vary depending on
the programme. These costs may be covered by <a shape="rect" href="../insurance/private_health_insurance.html">private health insurance</a>.

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Alcohol addiction services that are run by your Local Health Office of the
HSE are public services and all out-patient services are free of charge. There
may be a charge for residential programmes. Private health insurance or a
medical card may cover stays in selected drug treatment centres. For more
details, you should contact your health insurer.</p>

<p>You can check with your pharmacy whether medication you are prescribed to
treat symptoms of alcohol addiction qualifies under the <a shape="rect" href="../entitlement_to_health_services/drugs_payment_scheme.html">Drugs
Payment Scheme</a>.</p>

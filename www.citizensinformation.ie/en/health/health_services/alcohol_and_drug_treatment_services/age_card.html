<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/si/0159.html">Intoxicating Liquor
Act 1988 (Age Card) Regulations 2007</a> provide for a voluntary Age Card
scheme in Ireland. Age Cards can be obtained by individuals in Ireland aged 18
and over to show that they have reached the legal age for purchasing alcohol.
This card is a <em>proof of age card</em> and is <strong>not an identity
card</strong>. In fact, the card can only be used to show you have reached the
legal age for purchasing alcohol. It should not be obtained or used for any
other purpose. </p>

  <li>Your date of birth </li>
  <li>A photograph identifying you </li>
  <li>Relevant security features (such as a metal hologram, embossed symbol,
    encoded magnetic stripe, etc.) </li>
</ul><h3>Replacing a lost or misplaced Age Card</h3>

required to make a report on the loss or theft of your original card when
presenting your application for authentication at your local Garda Station. </p>

<p>There is a charge of €10 for a replacement Age Card. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Abortion is illegal in Ireland except where there is a real and substantial
risk to the life (as distinct from the health) of the mother. This includes a
risk arising from a threat of suicide. The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2013/act/35/enacted/en/html">Protection
of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013</a> regulates the limited circumstances in
which a pregnancy can be legally terminated. The Department of Health has
published <a href="http://health.gov.ie/blog/publications/implementation-of-the-protection-of-life-during-pregnancy-act-2013-guidance-document-for-health-professionals/">guidance
for health professionals</a> on the operation of the Act.</p>

<p>Women may not be prevented from travelling abroad to get an abortion. It is
<span>not lawful</span> to encourage or advocate an abortion in individual
cases. It <span>is lawful</span> to provide information in Ireland about
abortions abroad, subject to strict conditions. This document explains the
rules about providing such information.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Information about abortion services in other countries may be made available
under certain conditions. The law on the subject was passed in 1995 and is
usually known as the Abortion Information Act. Its full title is <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0005/index.html">Regulation
of Information (Services outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act
1995</a>. The Act sets out how information about legal abortion services
outside Ireland may be given to individuals or groups in Ireland.</p>

<p>Information about abortion abroad may be made available by doctors, by
specific agencies or by individual counsellors. The rules apply to all
providers of information but a distinction is made between information that is
provided for the general public and information that is made available directly
to a pregnant woman by a doctor or an advisory service. </p>

<p>The Act does not oblige anyone to give information on abortion. It lays down
rules for people and agencies who wish to give this information. People and
agencies who engage in pregnancy counselling but do not give abortion
information are not affected by the rules set out in this Act.</p>

<h3>What sort of information is covered by the Abortion Information Act?</h3>

<p>The act applies to information that is "likely to be required by a woman for
the purpose of availing herself of services provided outside the state for the
termination of pregnancies" – in non-legal terms, this basically means the
names and addresses of abortion services. </p>

<h3>General information about abortion services</h3>

<p>General information about abortion services that is published or made
available in journals, magazines, broadcasts, public meetings, etc., must
comply with the following rules:</p>
<ul><li>The services must be lawfully available in the other country </li>
  <li>The information and the method and manner of its publication must be in
    compliance with the law of that country </li>
  <li>The information must be truthful and objective and must not advocate or
    promote abortion</li>
</ul><p>This sort of information must not be made available by means of billboards,
public notices or by unsolicited books and newspapers. </p>

<p>These rules apply regardless of who is giving the information – it could
be a bookshop, an advice centre or a doctor. </p>

<h3>One-to-one information counselling</h3>

<p>Information and counselling that is provided to a pregnant woman by doctors,
counselling agencies and related services is subject to stricter rules.
(Information given by a private individual such as a relative or friend is not
affected by these rules). If information on abortion is being given, the
following rules apply:</p>
<ul><li>The information must comply with the rules set out above for information
    to the general public </li>
  <li>Information, advice and counselling must be given on all options
    available to the pregnant woman; this information must be truthful and
    objective and must fully inform the woman on all options and must not be
    accompanied by any advocacy or promotion of abortion </li>
</ul><p>Doctors or agencies who do not give abortion information but who do provide
pregnancy counselling are not subject to any of these rules about the
information and counselling they give.</p>

<h3>Crisis pregnancy counselling services </h3>

<p>Crisis pregnancy counselling services are available free of charge to all
women living in Ireland. Services are State-funded by the HSE Crisis Pregnancy
Programme and available at 50 locations nationwide. For a list of these
services visit <a shape="rect" href="http://www.positiveoptions.ie">positiveoptions.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>Financial interests</h3>

<p>Any person or agency giving abortion information may not have any financial
interest in an abortion service in another country. Similarly, the Act
prohibits the giving of information if a foreign abortion service has a
financial interest in the Irish abortion information service or if a third
party has an interest in both the abortion service and the abortion information
service. The person or agency must not benefit in any way from the woman's
decision to choose the abortion option; fees may be charged but they must be
the same no matter what option is chosen. The person or agency may provide and
charge for post-abortion treatment and counselling.</p>

<h3>Making appointments</h3>

<p>It is lawful to give the names and addresses of abortion services. It is not
lawful to make an appointment with an abortion service on behalf of the
pregnant woman. This does not prevent doctors or others from giving medical
records to the woman. </p>

<h3>Post-abortion services</h3>

<p>Post-abortion counselling and medical check-ups are available free of charge
in Ireland to women who have had an abortion abroad. These services are
State-funded by the HSE Crisis Pregnancy Programme. For a list of services
visit <a shape="rect" href="http://abortionaftercare.ie/">abortionaftercare.ie</a>.</p>

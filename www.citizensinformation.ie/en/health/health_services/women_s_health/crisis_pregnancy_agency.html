<p>The <a href="http://www.crisispregnancy.ie/">HSE Crisis Pregnancy
Programme</a> is responsible for developing and implementing a national
strategy to address the issue of crisis pregnancy. The Crisis Pregnancy
Programme works to achieve the following core objectives: </p>
<ul><li>Reducing the number of crisis pregnancies by providing education, advice
    and contraceptive services </li>
  <li>Reducing the number of women with crisis pregnancies who opt for abortion
    by offering services and supports which make other options more attractive
  </li>
  <li>Providing counselling services, medical services and other health
    services to provide support after crisis pregnancy</li>
</ul><h3>Education resources</h3>

<p>The website <a href="http://www.b4udecide.ie/">b4udecide.ie</a> is a Crisis
Pregnancy Programme resource for young people and parents with information on
sex education. There are other resources for parents, teachers and youth
workers on the <a href="http://www.crisispregnancy.ie">Crisis Pregnancy
Programme website</a>.</p>

<p>The Programme provides information on contraception at <a href="http://www.thinkcontraception.ie/">ThinkContraception.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>Crisis pregnancies and pregnancy counselling</h3>

<p>The Crisis Pregnancy Programme website <a href="http://www.positiveoptions.ie/">Positive Options</a> provides details of
organisations that offer pregnancy counselling services in Ireland. These
counselling services are free of charge. Positive Options also provides a text
message facility to get a list of these services: Freetext LIST to 50444.</p>

options open to you.</p>

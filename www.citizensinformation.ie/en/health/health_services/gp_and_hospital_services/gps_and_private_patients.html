<p>If you do not have a medical card or GP Visit Card, you are considered a
private patient if you visit your family doctor (GP). This means that you must
pay for the services provided. </p>

<p>Some GPs provide services only to private patients. GPs who are in the
General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme cannot treat private patients differently
from medical card or GP Visit Card holders. You must be seen in the same
premises and have access to the same surgery hours, etc.</p>

<p>There are <span>no set fees or charges for GP services</span>. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The relationship between a private patient and a GP is essentially a
contract - you enter into a contract with your GP to provide you with services
and you pay for the service. The amount of the payment is a matter for you and
the GP.</p>

<p>GPs may provide cetain services to private patients free of charge - for
example, <a href="../women_s_health/maternity_and_infant_welfare_services.html">maternity
and infant welfare services</a> and immunisation and vaccination services if
they have agreements with the <a href="../../health_system/health_boards.html">Health Service Executive</a>
(HSE) to do so. </p>

<p>In the case of some vaccination services, (for example, the flu vaccine for
at-risk groups), the arrangement for private patients is that the actual
vaccination is free of charge but you must pay for the GP's service.</p>

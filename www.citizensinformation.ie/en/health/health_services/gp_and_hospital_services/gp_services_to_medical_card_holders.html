<p>General Practitioners (GPs) provide services to medical card holders free of
charge. GPs in the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme enter into contracts
with the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide services.</p>

<p>Patients may generally choose their doctor from a panel of doctors who are
part of the scheme, provided the doctor is willing to have them as patients. In
general, services must be provided by your own doctor but there are
arrangements for emergencies and for moving out of your area.</p>

<p>Doctors must treat medical card patients in the same way as they treat
private patients.</p>

<h3>Choosing your doctor</h3>

<p>When you apply for a <a shape="rect" href="../entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical card</a>,
you choose a doctor that is taking part in the scheme and ask the doctor to
sign your application form to accept you as a patient. Contact your Local
Health Office for details of GPs in your area. </p>

<p>If you have a medical card and you want to change your doctor, you complete
a <a href="https://www.sspcrs.ie/portal/medapp/changedoctor.pdf">Change of
Doctor form (pdf)</a> giving details of the new doctor.</p>

<p>Medical cards may be issued for a limited period with a review date on the
card. In general, that means that the HSE will look again to see if you are
still entitled to a card. It does not usually involve choosing a doctor
again.</p>

<h3>Services provided by GPs under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme
</h3>

<p>The GP's contract with the HSE specifies the range of services that the
doctor must provide for medical card holders. Broadly speaking, these services
must be provided at the same level and on the same basis as services to the
GP's private patients. This means that, for example, surgery times must be the
same for all patients, access to home visits must be the same, etc.</p>

<p>Among the services that GPs provide for medical card holders are:</p>
<ul><li>Consultation services at the GP's surgery or at your home as appropriate.
  </li>
  <li>Proper and necessary treatment of a kind normally undertaken by a general
    practitioner; this is a matter of individual medical judgement but it also
    includes services such as immunisation and vaccination for children. </li>
  <li>Prescriptions for drugs, medicines and appliances as required. In some
    cases, GPs dispense drugs and medicines.</li>
  <li>Blood tests to diagnose or monitor a condition.</li>
</ul><p>There are certain services that GPs are not obliged to provide free of
charge, for example, eye tests for a driving licence or reports for life
assurance. You may also be charged for medical certificates for absence from
work. If you need a medical report to apply for a social welfare payment, the
<a href="http://www.welfare.ie">Department of Social Protection</a> may cover
the fee.</p>

<h3>Emergency services</h3>

<p>GPs in the GMS scheme are expected to provide or arrange for the provision
of appropriate emergency services for their own medical card patients. Rota
systems may exist to provide cross-cover arrangements with other doctors in
out-of-hours situations. </p>

<h3>If you move</h3>

<p>If you move from one Local Health Office area to another you do not have to
re-apply for a new GP visit card. You should contact your new <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">Local Health Office</a> which
can give you information about the GPs practising in the new area you live
in.</p>

<p>There are three different types of hospital provision in Ireland:</p>
<ul><li>Health Service Executive (HSE) hospitals, owned and funded by the
  HSE.</li>
  <li>Voluntary public hospitals, most of whose income comes from State funds.
    Voluntary public hospitals are sometimes owned by private bodies, for
    example, religious orders. Other voluntary public hospitals are
    incorporated by charter or statute and are run by boards often appointed by
    the Minister for Health. </li>
  <li>Private hospitals, which receive no State funding. </li>
</ul><p>Public health services are provided in <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/acutehospitals/hospitals/">HSE
hospitals and public voluntary hospitals</a> and in practice there is very
little difference between these two types of hospital. Most of these hospitals
also provide private health care but they must clearly distinguish between
public and private beds.</p>

<p>There are a number of purely private hospitals that operate independently of
state health services. If you opt for private care in a private hospital, you
must pay the full cost of treatment and maintenance.</p>

<p>Acute hospital services diagnose, treat and care for seriously ill or
injured patients. Acute hospital services are provided in HSE hospitals, public
voluntary hospitals and private hospitals. Some hospitals are specialist, for
example, maternity or psychiatric hospitals, while others are general.</p>

<p>The large general and regional hospitals provide a broad range of services.
Smaller local hospitals may not be able to cater for all illnesses and
treatments and you may have to be transferred to a larger hospital or to a
specialist hospital. </p>

<p>In-patient services are institutional services provided for people in
hospitals, convalescent homes or homes for people with physical or mental
disabilities. Day-case treatment is regarded as an in-patient service but you
do not stay in hospital overnight.</p>

<p>Out-patient services are generally taken to include accident and emergency
services as well as planned services provided on an out-patient basis. For
example, you may be referred by your family doctor (GP) for specialist
assessment by a consultant or his or her team or for diagnostic assessments
such as x-rays or laboratory tests or for treatment such as physiotherapy.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>As a public patient, you do not have to pay for consultants' services and
you do not have a choice of consultants. In many areas, there are waiting lists
for non-emergency services. Information on <a href="http://www.ntpf.ie/home/nwld.htm">waiting times for in-patient
treatment</a> is available online.</p>

<p>If you choose to be a private patient in a public hospital, you become the
private patient of the consultant treating you and you must pay for all
consultant services provided to you. There is also a set <a href="hospital_charges.html">daily charge for private patients in public
hospitals</a>.</p>

<p>Private hospitals are free to set their own charges to patients. <a href="../health_insurance/private_health_insurance.html">Private health
insurance</a> may cover some or all of the costs involved.</p>

<p>Deaf and hard of hearing patients are entitled to interpretation services in
public hospitals in Ireland. You should notify the hospital that you are deaf
or hard of hearing in advance of your visit so they can make any necessary
arrangements. Further information regarding these services is available from
the Director of Disability Services at your <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">Local Health Office</a>.</p>

<p>Public and voluntary hospitals are subject to <a href="../../government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/freedom_of_information.html">Freedom
of Information legislation</a>. This means, among other things, that they are
obliged to publish information about their structures, services and practices.
If the hospital holds personal information about you, you can access those
records.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You should obtain a letter of referral from your GP if you need to receive
hospital treatment. You can attend accident and emergency departments in most
general hospitals and some specialist hospitals without a letter of referral
but you may be charged for your visit. </p>

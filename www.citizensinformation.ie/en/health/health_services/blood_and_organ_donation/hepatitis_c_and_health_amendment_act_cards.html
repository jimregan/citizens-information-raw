<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>There are special arrangements within the health services for people who
have contracted Hepatitis C directly or indirectly through the administration
within the State of Human Immunoglobulin-Anti-D or another blood product or a
blood transfusion. They are entitled to services such as GP, nursing and home
help services as well as counselling services, regardless of their income.
These services are covered by the Health Amendment Act Card (HAA Card).</p>

<h3>Hepatitis C Insurance Scheme </h3>

<p>The Hepatitis C insurance scheme enables those infected with Hepatitis C
and/or HIV, through the administration within the State of contaminated blood
or blood products, to take out life assurance, mortgage protection and travel
insurance.</p>

<p>Under this scheme a person requiring insurance will pay the average basic
premium which an uninfected person of the same age and gender would pay. The
insurance scheme pays the additional premiums levied or covers the additional
risks that would otherwise prevent a policy being taken out.</p>

<p>The Hepatitis C Insurance Scheme is set up under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2006/A2206.pdf">Hepatitis
C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act (No.22) of 2006 (pdf)</a>. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you have contracted Hepatitis C directly or indirectly through the
administration within the State of Human Immunoglobulin-Anti-D or another blood
product or a blood transfusion, you can apply for a Health Amendment Act (HAA)
Card.</p>

<p>The HAA Card entitles you to the following services, free of charge. </p>
<ul><li>General practitioner services </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../entitlement_to_health_services/prescribed_drugs_and_medicines.html">Prescribed
    drugs and medicines</a> and medical and surgical aids and appliances </li>
  <li>Home nursing and <a shape="rect" href="../care_in_your_community/home_helps.html">home support services</a>
  </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../dental_aural_and_optical_services/dental_services.html">Dental</a>,
    <a shape="rect" href="../dental_aural_and_optical_services/optometric_and_ophthalmic_services.html">ophthalmic</a>
    and <a shape="rect" href="../dental_aural_and_optical_services/aural_services.html">aural
    services and appliances</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../care_in_your_community/physiotherapy_services.html">Physiotherapy
    services</a> </li>
  <li>Counselling services for both you and your family and </li>
  <li>Such other services as may be prescribed by the Minister for Health. </li>
</ul><p>This is an individual entitlement for the person with Hepatitis C. However,
dependants are entitled to a free counselling in respect of Hepatitis C. </p>

<p>These counselling services are provided by private practitioners, by
arrangement between you and the Health Service Executive (HSE). </p>

<p>You are entitled to these services free of charge even if you require them
for non-Hepatitis C-related illnesses. All GPs are eligible to provide
services. You do not have to choose a GP who is part of the Primary Care
Re-imbursement Service. </p>

<p>Home support services can be provided by the home help service in the HSE.
If you are considered to be in need of home help services, the HSE Area may
provide the service directly or you may make your own arrangements. If you make
your own arrangements, you are the employer of the home help and you are
responsible for your employee's PRSI and Tax. The HSE pays a contribution to
the costs involved.</p>

<p>Dental, ophthalmic and aural services are provided on broadly the same basis
for medical card holders. However, there are more favourable arrangements for
HAA Card holders.</p>

<p>You can get hearing aids and aural services by arrangement with the HSE. </p>

<p>The HSE arranges for the supply of medical and surgical appliances that are
not available from a pharmacist. <br></p>

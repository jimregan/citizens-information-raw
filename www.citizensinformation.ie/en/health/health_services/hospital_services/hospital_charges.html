<p>Everyone, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the Health Service
Executive (HSE) <a shape="rect" href="../entitlement_to_health_services/entitlement_to_public_health_services.html">as
being ordinarily resident in Ireland</a> is entitled to access in-patient and
out-patient services in publicly funded hospitals, that is, HSE hospitals and
voluntary hospitals. <a href="../entitlement_to_health_services/health_services_and_visitors_to_ireland.html">Certain
visitors to Ireland are also entitled to public health services</a>, for
example, people covered under EU Regulations. </p>

<p>You may have to pay some hospital charges, unless you have a <a shape="rect" href="../entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical card</a> or
belong to certain other groups listed below. <span>There are daily in-patient
charges and some long-term stay charges.</span></p>

<p><span>If you are not resident in Ireland and you do not belong to any of the
groups that are entitled to free services, you have to pay the full economic
cost of the bed, whether it is a public bed or a private bed. You also have to
pay the consultant. </span><br></p>

<p>The HSE has the discretion to reduce or waive the charges in cases of
hardship.</p>

<h3>Charges for accident and emergency/casualty and out-patient services </h3>

<p>If you use accident and emergency services <strong>without</strong> being
referred there by a GP, there is a charge of €100. <strong>There is no charge
if you are referred by a GP</strong> (bring your referral letter with you) or
for certain groups listed below.<strong></strong> </p>

<p>The charge applies to the following <strong>public</strong> facilities:</p>
<ul><li>Emergency departments</li>
  <li>Accident and emergency departments</li>
  <li>Casualty departments</li>
  <li>Minor injury units</li>
  <li>Urgent care centres</li>
  <li>Local injury units</li>
  <li>Any other facility providing similar services</li>
</ul><p></p>

<p>The charge of €100 does not apply to the following groups:</p>
<ul><li>Medical card holders </li>
  <li>People who are admitted to hospital as an in-patient as a result of
    attending the casualty department (you will then be subject to in-patient
    charges) </li>
  <li>People receiving treatment for prescribed infectious diseases </li>
  <li>Children up to 6 weeks of age</li>
  <li>Children, in respect of the following diseases and disabilities:
    “mental handicap, mental illness, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina
    bifida, hydrocephalus, haemophilia and cerebral palsy”</li>
  <li>Children referred for treatment from child health clinics and school
    health examinations </li>
  <li>People who are entitled to hospital services because of EU Regulations
  </li>
  <li>Women receiving <a shape="rect" href="../women_s_health/maternity_and_infant_welfare_services.html">maternity
    services</a></li>
  <li>People with Hepatitis C who have a <a href="../blood_and_organ_donation/hepatitis_c_and_health_amendment_act_cards.html">Health
    Amendment Act Card</a> </li>
</ul><p>The charge applies to the first visit in relation to an illness or accident.
If you have to return for further visits to an out-patient clinic in relation
to the same illness or accident, you should not have to pay the charge
again.</p>

<p>You can be referred by your family doctor to the
<strong>out-patients</strong> department of a public hospital for specialist
assessment by a consultant or his or her team or for diagnostic assessments
(for example, x-rays, laboratory tests, physiotherapy). If you attend this
service as a public patient, you will not have to pay for this service. If you
wish to attend a consultant in a private capacity, you must pay their fee. </p>

<h3>Public in-patients in public hospitals</h3>

<p>If you are a public patient in a public hospital under the care of a
consultant for treatment and you remain overnight, you are receiving overnight
in-patient services. </p>

<p>If you are admitted to the hospital under the care of a consultant where you
do not require the use of a bed overnight and your discharge from hospital is
planned, you are receiving day in-patient services. </p>

<p>From 1 January 2017, the statutory charge for overnight and day in-patient
services is €80 per day up to a maximum of €800 in any 12 consecutive
months. The charge does not apply to the following groups:</p>
<ul><li>Medical card holders </li>
  <li>People receiving treatment for prescribed infectious diseases</li>
  <li>Children up to 6 weeks of age</li>
  <li>Children with the following diseases and disabilities: "mental handicap,
    mental illness, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida,
    hydrocephalus, haemophilia and cerebral palsy" </li>
  <li>Children referred for treatment from child health clinics and school
    board examinations </li>
  <li>People who are entitled to hospital services because of EU Regulations
  </li>
  <li>Women receiving maternity services </li>
</ul><h3>Private in-patients in public hospitals</h3>

<p>If you choose to be treated as a private patient of a consultant when you
are admitted to a public hospital, you are charged for the inpatient services
according to the category of the hospital and (for an overnight stay) according
to the type of room you are in.</p>

<p>Rates from January 2014 are: </p>

    </tr></tbody></table><p>The hospitals in each category are listed in the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/act/pub/0031/print.html#sched1">Health
(Amendment) Act 2013</a> with four changes subsequently made by <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2014/en.si.2014.0075.pdf">Statutory
Instrument No.75 of 2014 (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>The Act provides that public hospitals must levy the private in-patient
charge on all in-patients who opt to be treated privately by their consultant.
</p>

<p>If you are a private patient, you must pay for the services of the
consultant who is treating you. You must also pay for the services of any other
consultant who is involved in caring for you (for example, the radiation
oncologist or anaesthetist). </p>

<h3>Mental health services</h3>

<p>You have the same entitlement to public health services for mental illness
as for any other illness. You must pay for maintenance and treatment in private
psychiatric hospitals. <a shape="rect" href="../insurance/private_health_insurance.html">Health insurance
companies</a> sometimes treat psychiatric hospital costs differently from
general hospital costs. The same rules apply to long-term institutional care
for psychiatric patients as to long-term institutional care for other patients.
</p>

<p>Mental health in-patient and out-patient services are provided free of
charge to children aged under 16 years who have a mental illness.</p>

<h3>Long-Stay Contributions</h3>

<p>If you have been in hospital, but not receiving acute in-patient care, for
more than 30 days, you may be charged <a href="../health_services_for_people_with_disabilities/long_stay_contributions.html">Long-Stay
Contributions for Residential Support Services</a>.</p>

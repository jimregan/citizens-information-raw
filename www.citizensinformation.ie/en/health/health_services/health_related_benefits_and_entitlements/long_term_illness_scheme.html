<p>People suffering from certain conditions can get free drugs, medicines and
medical and surgical appliances for the treatment of that condition. These are
provided under the Long Term Illness Scheme. This scheme is administered by the
Health Service Executive (HSE), under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1970/en/act/pub/0001/sec0059.html#zza1y1970s59">Section
59 of the Health Act 1970.</a> </p>

<p>The Long Term Illness Scheme <span>does not depend on your income</span> or
<span>other circumstances</span>. You may also be eligible for a <a shape="rect" href="../entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">Medical
Card</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../entitlement_to_health_services/gp_visit_cards.html">GP visit card</a>,
depending on your circumstances. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you have a child with a disability you need to know about the various
services in place to support you. Legally, a child is someone under the age of
18 years. Often however, parents (or other family members) continue to care for
children with disabilities long after they reach adulthood.</p>

<p>Children with disabilities are entitled to the same services and family
benefits as all other children. The emphasis in the following information is on
those services and payments specifically related to disability. They apply
whether the child was born with the disability or acquired it later. </p>

<h3>Health services</h3>

<p>GPs (family doctors) provide free <a href="../women_s_health/maternity_and_infant_welfare_services.html">developmental
examinations</a> in the weeks following birth. <a href="../care_in_your_community/public_health_nurses.html">Public health
nurses</a> monitor the development of babies in their first months and can
provide information and support.</p>

<p>Children with a disability who were born after 1 June 2002 are entitled to
an <a href="../health_services_for_people_with_disabilities/assessment_of_need_for_people_with_disabilites.html">assessment
of need</a> of health supports and services and to get an Assessment Report and
a statement of the services they will receive.</p>

<p>Health services for children with disabilities are organised and delivered
differently in different areas. Your <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">Local Health Office</a> can
tell you the services that are available in your area.</p>

<p>Your child may be eligible for a <a href="../../medical_cards_and_gp_visit_cards/medical_card.html">medical
card</a> or <a href="../../medical_cards_and_gp_visit_cards/gp_visit_cards.html">GP visit
card</a> depending on your circumstances. The GP visit card is available to all
children under the age of 6, without an income test.</p>

<p>People who have certain conditions that are covered by the <a href="../../drugs_and_medicines/long_term_illness_scheme.html">Long Term
Illness Scheme</a> can get free medicines and appliances for those
conditions.</p>

<p>There are <a href="../gp_and_hospital_services/hospital_charges.html">charges for public
hospitals</a> but some people are exempt, including medical card holders,
children up to six weeks of age, children who have certain diseases and
disabilities, and children referred from child health clinics or school health
checks.</p>

<p><a href="../care_in_your_community/community_care_services.html">Community care
services</a> include <a href="../care_in_your_community/public_health_nurses.html">public health
nurses</a>, <a href="../care_in_your_community/social_work_services.html">social
workers</a>, <a href="../care_in_your_community/occupational_therapy_services.html">occupational

<a href="../health_services_for_people_with_disabilities/regulation_residential_care_people_with_disabilities.html">regulation
of residential services for children and adults with disabilities</a>.</p>

<h3>Education</h3>

<p>Children with a disability who were born after 1 June 2002 are entitled to
an <a href="../health_services_for_people_with_disabilities/assessment_of_need_for_people_with_disabilites.html">assessment
of need</a> of education supports and services.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../education/pre_school_education_and_childcare/early_childhood_care_and_education_scheme.html">Early
Childhood Care and Education Scheme (ECCE)</a> provides free early childhood
care and education for children of pre-school age. The <a href="http://aim.gov.ie/">Access and Inclusion Model (AIM)</a> provides
supports to help children with a disability access the ECCE.</p>

<p><a href="../../../education/the_irish_education_system/special_education.html">Special
needs education</a> provides supports to help children with disabilities in <a href="../../../education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_primary_school/special_needs_education_primary_schools.html">primary
education</a> and <a href="../../../education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_post_primary_school/post_primary_education_for_students_with_special_needs.html">post-primary
education</a>. Many areas have <a href="../../../education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_primary_school/school_transport_for_children_with_special_needs.html">school
transport for children with special needs</a>.</p>

<p>There are also <a href="../../../education/third_level_education/applying_to_college/third_level_education_for_students_with_disabilities.html">supports
for third-level students with a disability</a>.</p>

<h3>Providing for a child with a disability</h3>

<p>Although a child with a disability may be maintained by their parents after
the age of 18 this does not provide them with any special entitlement to
provision in a parent’s will. If you want to make specific provision for your
child, you should get legal advice. One option is a trust from which your child
may benefit after your death. Many parents use discretionary trusts to provide
for a child with a disability without affecting entitlement to benefits.</p>

<p>You may use a covenant as a tax-efficient way to give money to a child aged
over 18, but this could affect the child’s entitlement to <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability
Allowance</a>.</p>

<p>Most public sector <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/occupational_pensions.html">occupational
pension schemes</a>, and some private sector schemes, have provisions that
allow for the pension arrangements for dependent children to continue for the
lifetime of a permanently incapacitated child. </p>

<h3>Income support</h3>

<p>You may qualify for <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/carers/payments_to_carers.html">supports
for carers</a>. </p>

<p>There is a range of <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/benefits_to_people_who_are_sick_or_have_a_disability.html">social
welfare payments for people who have a disability</a>. These include <a shape="rect" href="../../../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability
Allowance</a> which your child may be entitled to when they reach the age of
16. If your child takes up employment, it may affect their Disability
Allowance. For more information about this, see <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_and_work/disability_payments_and_work.html">Disability
payments and work</a>.</p>

<h3>Work and training</h3>

<p>People with disabilities may access rehabilitative training for core life
skills or vocational training for work-related skills. Read more about <a shape="rect" href="../services_for_people_with_disabilities/rehabilitation_and_training_services_for_people_with_disabilities.html">rehabilitation
and training services for people with disabilities</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../../../employment/employment_and_disability/working_with_a_disability.html">Employment
supports</a> aim to help people with a disability gain and retain
employment.</p>

<h3>Transport costs</h3>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="../../travel_and_recreation/transport_and_disability/tax_relief_for_disabled_drivers_and_disabled_passengers.html">Disabled
Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme</a>, tax reliefs are available for the
costs of buying and using a vehicle.</p>

<h3>Adapting a home</h3>

<p>If you need to adapt your house for your child's needs you may qualify for
the <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/housing_grants_and_schemes/housing_adaptation_grant_for_people_with_disability.html">Housing
Adaptation Grant</a>. </p>

<h3>Managing money</h3>

<p>If your child is getting Disability Allowance, but is not capable of
managing money, you may be the agent appointed by the Department of Social
Protection to deal with the money. The money belongs to your child and you must
use it for their benefit. If your child has substantial money or assets, they
may be made a <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/wards_of_court.html">Ward of Court</a>.</p>

<h3>Planning for the future</h3>

<p>Most parents of people with disabilities want to try to ensure that their
children will be adequately cared for after their own deaths. You should get
legal advice if you want to make special provisions for a child with a
disability in your will and also ensure that they retain entitlement to
benefits such as the Disability Allowance and <a shape="rect" href="../entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical card</a>.</p>

<p>You may appoint a guardian in your will. This however only applies if your
child is under 18 when it comes into effect. It is not possible to appoint a
guardian for an adult child.</p>

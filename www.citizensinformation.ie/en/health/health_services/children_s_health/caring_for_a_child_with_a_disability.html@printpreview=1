<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you have a child with a disability you need to know about the various
services in place to support you. Legally, a child is someone under the age of
18 years. Often however, parents (or other family members) continue to care for
children with disabilities long after they reach adulthood.</p>

<p>Children with disabilities are entitled to the same services and family
benefits as all other children. The emphasis in the following information is on
those services and payments specifically related to disability. They apply
whether the child was born with the disability or acquired it later. </p>

<p>You can find more information on services and supports in our booklet <a href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/publications/entitlements/downloads/children_with_disabilities.pdf">Entitlements
for children with disabilities (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Providing for a child with a disability</h3>

<p>Parents have an obligation to maintain their children until adulthood.
Although a child with a disability may be maintained by their parents after the
age of 18 this does not provide them with any special entitlement to provision
in a parent’s will.</p>

<p>You may use a covenant as a tax-efficient way to give money to a child aged
over 18, but this could affect the child’s entitlement to <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability
Allowance</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to make specific provision for your child, you should get legal
advice. One option is a trust from which your child may benefit after your
death. Many parents use discretionary trusts to provide for a child with a
disability without affecting entitlement to benefits.</p>

<p>Most public sector <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/occupational_pensions.html">occupational
pension schemes</a>, and some private sector schemes, have provisions that
allow for the pension arrangements for dependent children to continue for the
lifetime of a permanently incapacitated child. </p>

<h3>Income support</h3>

<p>There are a number of <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/carers/payments_to_carers.html">payments
for carers</a> that you may qualify for. </p>

<p>When your child reaches the age of 16 they may be entitled to <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability
Allowance</a>. Any means that the child has in their own right will be taken
into account.</p>

<p>If your child takes up employment, it may affect their Disability Allowance.
For more information about this, see <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_and_work/disability_payments_and_work.html">Disability
payments and work</a>.</p>

<h3>Transport costs</h3>

<p>There is a range of tax reliefs available for the buying and use of vehicles
under the <a shape="rect" href="../../travel_and_recreation/transport_and_disability/tax_relief_for_disabled_drivers_and_disabled_passengers.html">Disabled
Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme</a>.</p>

<h3>Adapting a home</h3>

<p>You may qualify for the <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/housing_grants_and_schemes/housing_adaptation_grant_for_people_with_disability.html">Housing
Adaptation Grant</a> if you need to adapt your house for your child's needs.
You should apply to your local authority. </p>

<h3>Health services</h3>

<p>Your child’s entitlement to health services depends on your family’s
circumstances. If your family is not entitled to a medical card or GP Visit
Card, your child may get an individual medical card if they have particular
medical expenses, or else may be entitled to the following: </p>
<ul><li>In-patient or out-patient short-stay charges are not levied if your child
    is suffering from a one of a number of specific long-term conditions or if
    referred from child health services or school health services </li>
  <li>Free prescribed drugs and medicines for specific long-term conditions
  </li>
  <li>Various health services for people with disabilities </li>
  <li>Various community care services </li>
</ul><h3>Long-stay charges</h3>

<p>If your child is in residential care and aged over 18, they may be required
to pay <a shape="rect" href="../hospital_services/hospital_charges.html">long-stay care charges</a>.
</p>

<h3>Education</h3>

<p>Children with disabilities may have <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/the_irish_education_system/special_education.html">special
educational needs</a> and there are provisions for <a href="../../education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_primary_school/special_needs_education_primary_schools.html">special
needs education in primary schools</a> and <a href="../../education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_post_primary_school/post_primary_education_for_students_with_special_needs.html">special
needs education in post-primary schools</a>. </p>

<p>There are various support arrangements for <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/third_level_education/applying_to_college/third_level_education_for_students_with_disabilities.html">students
with disabilities in third-level education</a>. <br></p>

<h3>Work and training</h3>

<p>People with disabilities may access rehabilitative training core life skills
or vocational training for work-related skills. </p>

<p>Read more about <a shape="rect" href="../services_for_people_with_disabilities/rehabilitation_and_training_services_for_people_with_disabilities.html">rehabilitation
and training services for people with disabilities</a>.</p>

<h3>Making decisions</h3>

<p>The rights of parents to make decisions on behalf of their children are the
same whether or not those children have disabilities. This means that, in
general, parents have no right to make decisions on behalf of their children
once they reach 18. Children under 18 have the right to make specific
decisions, for example, they may validly give consent to medical treatment from
the age of 16 and they may legally engage in sexual activities from age 17.</p>

<p>In practice, parents of children with intellectual disabilities frequently
make decisions on behalf of their adult children but they do not have the legal
right to do so.</p>

<h3>Managing money</h3>

<p>Your child may not be capable of managing money. If they are getting the
Disability Allowance, you may be the agent appointed by the Department of
Social Protection to deal with the money. If this is the case, you have the
same responsibilities as all other agents. The money belongs to your child and
you must use it for their benefit. If your child has substantial money or
assets, it is likely that they will be made a <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/wards_of_court.html">Ward of Court</a>.</p>

<h3>Consent to medical treatment</h3>

<p>If your child is capable of making decisions, then they may validly <a shape="rect" href="../legal_matters_and_health/consent_to_medical_and_surgical_procedures.html">consent
to medical treatment from the age of 16</a>. If they are not capable of making
decisions, it seems that you are entitled to make these decisions until age 18.
After that, you have no right to make decisions on behalf of your child. </p>

<h3>Sexual relationships</h3>

<p>Sexual relationships between consenting people who are each over the age of
17, whether those relationships are heterosexual or homosexual, are generally
legal. Some people with intellectual disabilities may not have the capacity to
consent to a sexual relationship.</p>

<p>The criminal law provides that it may be unlawful to engage in sexual
activities with a person with a learning disability even if that person
consents. It is a criminal offence to have or attempt to have sexual
intercourse with a “mentally impaired person” unless married to that
person.</p>

<h3>Planning for the future</h3>

<p>Parents of children with disabilities, especially those with learning
disabilities are often concerned about how to ensure that their children are
financially secure and that they will not be exploited. The mechanisms
available are rather complex and not always effective. You may arrange to have
your child made a Ward of Court.</p>

<p>Most parents of people with disabilities want to try to ensure that their
children will be adequately cared for after their own deaths. You should get
legal advice if you want to make special provisions for a child with a
disability in your will and also ensure that they retain entitlement to
benefits such as the Disability Allowance and <a shape="rect" href="../entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical card</a>.</p>

<p>You may appoint a guardian in your will. This however only has effect if
your child is under 18 when you die. It is not possible to appoint a guardian
for an adult child.</p>

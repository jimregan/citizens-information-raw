<p>The <a href="../../health_system/health_boards.html">Health Service
Executive</a> (HSE) provides a health screening service for pre-school children
that is free of charge. This service may be provided at health centres. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Services for pre-school children are provided by <a shape="rect" href="../care_in_your_community/public_health_nurses.html">public health
nurses</a> and Area Medical Officers that are employed by the HSE. All public
health nurses take direct referrals from parents. </p>

<p>Public health nurses are notified of all births in their area - either by
the hospital where the birth occurred or by the midwife who was present for a
home birth. Following the birth, your public health nurse will visit you and
your child at home free of charge, usually within 72 hours of returning home
from hospital.</p>

<p>Public health nurses provide both general health and specific developmental
advice to parents and monitor the development of the child.</p>

<p>A developmental examination is offered to every child by the Area Medical
Officer at approximately 9 months, by appointment, in the local health centre.
This examination covers all aspects of the child's development, including
hearing, sight, language development, physical development, etc, and is offered
to infants irrespective of the family's income. </p>

<p>Problems that are identified at this examination may be treated free of
chargeat out-patient hospital departments and any subsequent treatment is free
as apublic patient. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>In general, it is not necessary to apply for a developmental assessment for
your child at 9 months as your Local Health Office routinely sends out the
appointments. Most <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">Local
Health Offices</a> offer additional doctor and public health nurse appointment
clinics for those parents who have concerns about their child's development.

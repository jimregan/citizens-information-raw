<p>Children and young people are entitled to certain immunisation services free
of charge. These are provided in GP surgeries, in hospitals, in health clinics
or in school (depending on the circumstances).</p>

<p>Immunisation is a safe and effective way to help the body prevent or fight
off certain diseases. Immunisation is provided through vaccinations. Under the
Childhood Immunisation Programme all vaccines and their administration are
provided free of charge for all children. </p>

<p>Parents must consent to vaccinations for children and young people up to the
age of 16. Vaccination is not compulsory, but is strongly advised by the
Department of Health. You should discuss any concerns you may have with your
GP/family doctor before making a decision about your child's immunisation.</p>

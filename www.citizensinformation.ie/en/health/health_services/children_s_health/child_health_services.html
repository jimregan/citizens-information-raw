<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>Children in Ireland are dependants of their parents and have the same
entitlement to health services as their parents. This means that if your
parents have a <a shape="rect" href="../entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical card</a>,
you are included as a dependant on that card and are entitled to the same range
of services as your parents. </p>

<p>At the same time, there is a range of services specifically for children and
certain services are provided free of charge for children even if their parents
do not have a medical card. These services are generally provided as part of <a shape="rect" href="../women_s_health/maternity_and_infant_welfare_services.html">maternity
and infant welfare services</a>, <a shape="rect" href="health_services_for_preschool_children.html">health services for
preschool children</a> and <a shape="rect" href="school_health_services.html">school health services</a>. Children are
also entitled to <a shape="rect" href="immunisations_for_children.html">vaccination and immunisation
services</a> free of charge.</p>

<h3>GP visit card</h3>

<p>The <a href="../entitlement_to_health_services/gp_visit_cards_for_under_6s.html">GP
visit card for children under 6</a> is available to all children under the age
of 6. For other children the <a href="../entitlement_to_health_services/gp_visit_cards.html">GP visit
card</a> is means tested.</p>

<h3>Children's hospitals</h3>

<p>Children may be treated in public or private hospitals on the same basis as
adults. There are a number of specialist children's hospitals. <a shape="rect" href="../hospital_services/hospital_services_introduction.html">Entitlement to
hospital services</a> is the same in these hospitals as in public and voluntary
hospitals generally. These hospitals provide in-patient services, out-patient
services, day care, accident and emergency services and specialist services for
children. </p>

<p>If children are admitted to hospital for treatment of defects discovered at
child and school health examinations, they do not have to pay the usual
in-patient public <a shape="rect" href="../hospital_services/hospital_charges.html">hospital charges</a>. </p>

<h3>Who is a child or young person?</h3>

<p>There is no one age at which a child ceases to be a child for the purposes
of health services but 16 is the more usual cut-off point.</p>

<h3>Medical cards and young people over 16</h3>

<p>If you are over 16 years of age and under 26 and you are a student or are
financially dependent on your parents, you are entitled to medical card
services if they possess a <a href="../entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical card.</a>
In the <a href="../entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card_means_test_under_70s.html">medical
card means test</a>, there is an allowance for children aged over 16. This
allowance is increased if the child is in third-level education and is not
getting a grant.</p>

<h3>Foster children</h3>

<p>Children who are fostered all have individual medical cards. This is the
case regardless of the entitlements of their foster parents. <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/adoption_and_fostering/fostering.html">Read
more about fostering in Ireland here</a>. </p>

<h3>Prescribed drugs and medicines</h3>

<p>Children may be regarded as dependants up to age 18 (or 23 if in full-time
education) for the purposes of the <a shape="rect" href="../entitlement_to_health_services/drugs_payment_scheme.html">Drugs
Payment Scheme</a>. </p>

<p>Children of any age who are mentally or physically disabled to such an
extent that it is not reasonably possible for them to maintain themselves fully
and who are living at home may also be regarded as dependants for the
prescribed drugs and medicines arrangements. </p>

<h3>Consent to medical treatment</h3>

<p>In general, children over the age of 16 may themselves give consent to
surgical procedures. It is the practice to get parental consent to medical
procedures for children under that age even though it is not entirely clear
that parents have the ultimate decision. In a recent court case, the Supreme
Court ruled that only in exceptional circumstances would the court intervene to
make an order that was contrary to the decision of parents regarding procedures
for their children. </p>

<p>So, in general, parental consent is required for children to have medical
and surgical tests and procedures and to receive vaccinations and inoculations.

<h2>The law on the provision of health services to children in Ireland</h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1970/en/act/pub/0001/index.html">Health
Act 1970</a> is the principal legislation providing for children's health
services in Ireland. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1970/en/act/pub/0001/sec0066.html#zza1y1970s66">Section
66 of Health Act 1970</a> provides that the Health Service Executive (HSE) is
obliged to make available free of charge at clinics, health centres or other
places a health examination and treatment service for children aged under 6 and
for pupils attending national schools. Section 66 of that Act also allows for
other schools to request the service and the HSE has the discretion to extend
the service to such schools. </p>

<p>The legislation does not specify precisely what services are to be provided.
In practice, the services include immunisation services, developmental
paediatric examinations, visits by <a shape="rect" href="../care_in_your_community/public_health_nurses.html">public health
nurses</a>, child welfare clinics and <a shape="rect" href="school_health_services.html">school health examinations</a>.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1970/en/act/pub/0001/sec0067.html">Section
67 of the Health Act 1970</a> provides that the HSE must provide dental,
ophthalmic and aural treatment and appliances in respect of defects discovered
at school health examinations set out under Section 66 of the same Act. <br>
The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0011/index.html">Health
(Amendment) Act 1994</a> provides that the HSE must provide free dental
services for children who have attended schools to which Section 66 applied and
who are below a certain age. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/si/334/made/en/print">SI 334/2009
Health (Dental Services for Children) Regulations 2009</a> sets the age limit
as being up to the 16th birthday and provides that the children in question get
a preventive dental treatment service in addition to a dental health screening
service and primary care treatment in respect of defects discovered.<br></p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Palliative care aims to provide the best quality of life possible for a
terminally ill patient and their family, including keeping the patient free
from pain as far as is possible. It responds to physical, psychological, social
and spiritual needs and extends to support in bereavement. The Health Service
Executive (HSE) has responsibility for providing palliative care services. </p>

<p>Whilst palliative care was originally developed primarily for cancer
patients, care is also available to other patients such as those with motor
neurone disease or multiple sclerosis. </p>

<p>Palliative care can be provided in a hospice, in an acute or community hospital
or in the patient's home. Access to palliative care is decided by the HSE on
the basis of need. There is some variation in the availability of palliative
care throughout the country.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Palliative care is provided in a number of ways by specialist palliative
care in-patient units (hospices). These units form the hub around which other
services are developed. Currently there are nine hospice units; three in the
Dublin area and one each in counties Kildare, Limerick, Cork, Galway, Sligo and
Donegal.</p>

<p>Hospice or palliative care is provided: </p>
<ul><li>In people’s own homes, by home-care nurses working in cooperation with
    the family doctor and/or specialist palliative care team </li>
  <li>In hospices (dedicated specialist palliative care in-patient units) </li>
  <li>In general hospitals, by the hospital’s specialist palliative care team
  </li>
  <li>In community hospitals and nursing homes, by home-care nurses working in
    cooperation with the family doctor and/or specialist palliative care teams
    <br></li>
</ul><p>Palliative care is provided by the HSE in partnership with voluntary service
providers. Both public and private patients can use the in-patient units and
other services. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l765eb">Palliative care and children</h2>

<p>Palliative care for children is delivered differently from the palliative
care services for adults. Many children requiring palliative care have
life-limiting conditions, as opposed to advanced terminal conditions and
children may survive for many years with these life-limiting conditions. </p>

<p>Where children need palliative care it is usually provided at home. In the
home, the family is supported by their family doctor, public health nurse and
the specialist palliative care team (where available). The medical and nursing
care of children in hospitals is the responsibility of paediatric-trained
medical and nursing staff, with support from the specialist palliative care
service.</p>

<p>There is more information on palliative care for children on <a href="http://www.childrenspalliativehub.com/">The Palliative Hub for Children
and Young People</a>.</p>

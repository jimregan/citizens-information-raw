<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>Cancer is one of the main causes of death in Ireland. If you have any
concerns regarding cancer or have a family history of cancer or have symptoms
that you are worried about, you should contact your family doctor (GP).</p>

<p>Cancer care services are provided by your family doctor (GP), <a shape="rect" href="../hospital_services/hospital_services_introduction.html">hospitals</a>
and <a href="../care_in_your_community/community_care_services.html">community care
services</a>.</p>

<p>There are also <a shape="rect" href="palliative_care.html">palliative care
services</a>, that is, care for a patient and his/her family when there is no
longer a medical expectation of a cure.</p>

<h3>HSE National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP)</h3>

<p>It is widely accepted that the best outcomes for cancer patients are
achieved when the initial diagnosis, treatment plan, surgery and radiotherapy
are carried out by multi-disciplinary teams dealing with large numbers of
patients. </p>

<p>In 2007 the Health Service Executive (HSE) established a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hse.ie/cancer/">National Cancer Control Programme</a> to
manage, organise and deliver a national programme for the entire population.
Under the NCCP there are eight cancer centres within four managed cancer
control networks nationally. All initial diagnosis and surgery will eventually
take place in these cancer centres. Chemotherapy and follow up care will be
delivered more locally, according to care plans set at the cancer centres.
There are Rapid Access Clinics for prostate cancer detection and treatment and
lung cancer detection and treatment in all eight cancer centres. You may be
referred to one of these by your GP or other medical professional.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l13495">Expenses</h2>

<p><strong>Child oncology patients and children with permanent
disabilities</strong></p>

<p>In the case of children receiving treatment for cancer (that is, child
oncology patients) and children with permanent disabilities, tax relief may be
claimed on certain telephone, overnight accommodation, travel, hygiene products
and special clothing expenses incurred as health expenses. Read more about <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/taxation_and_medical_expenses.html">taxation
of medical expenses in Ireland here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Travel2Care scheme</strong></p>

<p>Some people who are referred to a cancer centre may need help with the costs
of travelling to their appointment(s). The NCCP therefore funds a <a href="http://www.cancer.ie/how-we-can-help/transport/financial-assistance">Travel2Care
scheme</a>, which is administered by the Irish Cancer Society. The scheme may
help patients with some travel costs if they have genuine financial hardship or
need due to travelling to a cancer centre.</p>

<p>Patients who are attending a designated cancer care centre for assessment
and/or investigations in one of the approved centres can apply by downloading
and completing <a href="http://www.cancer.ie/sites/default/files/content-attachments/2.3_travel2care_form_a.attachment.pdf">Application
Form A: Assessment and Investigation (pdf)</a> or request a hardcopy to be
posted by contacting: Travel2Care, Irish Cancer Society, Tel: (01) 231 6643/
231 6619 or email <a href="mailto:travel2care@irishcancer.ie">travel2care@irishcancer.ie</a>.</p>

<p>Patient who are having ongoing treatment (chemotherapy or radiotherapy),
must speak to a medical social worker, cancer nurse or other healthcare
professional who may complete Application Form B on their behalf.</p>

<p>BowelScreen, The National Bowel Screening Programme, offers free bowel
screening to men and women aged 60 to 69 every two years. Over time,
BowelScreen will be offered to those aged 55 to 74. The purpose of the
screening programme is to identify the population most at risk of colorectal
cancer and most likely to benefit from early detection and treatment.</p>

<p>Participants will be sent a screening test kit that includes step-by-step
instructions for self-administration of the test at home. The completed test
can then be sent by Freepost to an accredited laboratory for analysis.</p>

<p>Approximately 94 per cent of people will receive a normal test result and
will be sent another home test kit in two yearsâ€™ time while they remain
within the eligible age range. Five to six per cent of people will receive a
result that will require an additional test.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>The BowelScreen programme will send an invitation to men and women aged 60
to 69 years to take part in the programme.</p>

<p>BowelScreen puts together a register of people eligible for screening from
details supplied by the Department of Social Protection as well as from people
who contact BowelScreen to register themselves.</p>

<p>If you are aged between 60 to 69 years and living in Ireland, you can ring
BowelScreen on Freephone 1800 45 45 55 to check your details are on the
register. When your details are on the register you will, over time, receive an
invitation to take part in the BowelScreen programme. It may take up to three
years for all people on the register to receive an invitation. In the meantime
you should see your GP if you have any concerns or symptoms.</p>

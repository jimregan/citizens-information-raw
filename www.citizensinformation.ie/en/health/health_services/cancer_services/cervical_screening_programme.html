<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.cervicalcheck.ie/">CervicalCheck</a> is a
national screening programme to prevent and control cervical cancer. The
programme provides smear tests to women between the ages of 25 and 60. A smear
test is a simple procedure that only takes minutes and is the most effective
way to detect changes in the cells of the cervix.</p>

<p>The programme is voluntary and you are free to choose not to take part. </p>

<p>If you have any concerns regarding cervical cancer, have a family history of
cervical cancer or have symptoms you are worried about, you should contact your
family doctor (GP). </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>CervicalCheck provides free smear tests to women aged 25 to 60 who are
resident in the Republic of Ireland. </p>

<p><strong>Women outside of the eligibility guidelines</strong></p>

<p>Although CervicalCheck normally provides free smear tests only to women aged
25 to 60, there are a number of exceptions to the screening age including women
who: </p>
<ul><li>Are over 60 years of age and have never had a smear test</li>
  <li>Have attended a colposcopy service and require follow-up</li>
  <li>Have had or are about to have an organ transplant</li>
  <li>Have HIV</li>
  <li>Are on renal dialysis</li>
</ul><p><strong>How to apply</strong></p>

<p>If you are aged between 25 and 60 and have never had a CervicalCheck smear
test you can simply make an appointment with a registered GP practice or
clinic. A letter of invitation is not needed to make an appointment and attend
for a first CervicalCheck smear test.</p>

<p>To arrange a smear test you can contact a registered smeartaker of your
choice to make an appointment. Thousands of GPs, practice nurses, and women's
health, family planning and Well Woman clinics all over Ireland are registered
and you can see a full list in the <a href="https://apps.cervicalcheck.ie/screening-locations/find-a-smeartaker.588.findsmeartakersearch.html">Find
a Smeartaker</a> section of CervicalCheck or by calling CervicalCheck on
Freephone 1800 45 45 55. </p>

<p>CervicalCheck also sends invitation letters to women who are on the
CervicalCheck register. You can <a href="https://apps.cervicalcheck.ie/check-eligibility/check-eligibility.596.checkeligibilityv2.html">check
online whether you are on the register</a> or call CervicalCheck on Freephone
1800 45 45 55. To register by post, <a href="http://www.cervicalcheck.ie/_fileupload/WomenForms/CS-F-CC-28%20Self-Registration%20form.pdf">download
the self-registration form (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>Women who have already had a CervicalCheck smear test will be automatically
re-called by letter when their next smear test is due. </p>

<p>There are two national disability databases in Ireland, the <a shape="rect" href="intellectual_disability_database.html">National Intellectual Disability
Database</a> and the National Physical and Sensory Disability Database. Both
are managed by the <a href="http://www.hrb.ie">Health Research Board</a>.</p>

<p>The objective of the <a href="http://www.hrb.ie/health-information-in-house-research/disability/npsdd/">National
Physical and Sensory Disability Database</a> is to gather information on the
specialised health and personal social service needs of people with a physical,
sensory or speech and language disability. The database monitors current
service provision and future service requirements over a five-year period. It
is used for planning service developments, prioritising service needs and
assisting in resource allocation decisions at national and regional level. </p>

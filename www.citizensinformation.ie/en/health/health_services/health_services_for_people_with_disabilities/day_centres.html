<p>Day centres or day care centres in Ireland provide a range of social and
rehabilitative services for older people and people with disabilities. </p>

<p>Day centres include centres that provide day activation, such as
recreational, sport and leisure facilities, and specialised clinic facilities
that provide a combination of medical and rehabilitation services. Day centres
are provided on a variable basis throughout the country, some being provided
directly by the <a href="http://hse.ie">Health Service Executive</a> (HSE) and
others in conjunction with voluntary organisations. </p>

<p>Day centres providing medical care are less widely available. Access to day
centres is by referral and the eligibility conditions vary from area to area
with means tests applying in some cases. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>There are no clear-cut rules about day centres. In practice, day centres
have evolved as an alternative to hospital or other residential care for older
people and people with disabilities.</p>

<p>Their general purpose is to help older people, people with disabilities, and
their carers, to live in their communities and to promote independent
living.</p>

<p>The range of services available varies widely and can include any or all of
the following:</p>
<ul><li>Transport to and from day centres </li>
  <li>Health monitoring </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../care_in_your_community/chiropody_services.html">Chiropody</a> </li>
  <li>Personal care </li>
  <li>Laundry </li>
  <li>Continence promotion </li>
  <li>Activation programmes </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="rehabilitation_and_training_services_for_people_with_disabilities.html">Rehabilitative
    training</a> </li>
  <li>Social skills for people with learning disabilities </li>
  <li>Advice for carers </li>
  <li>Meals </li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>There may be a small charge for transport and meals provided by day centres.

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

nurse</a>. People with intellectual disabilities or autism may be recommended

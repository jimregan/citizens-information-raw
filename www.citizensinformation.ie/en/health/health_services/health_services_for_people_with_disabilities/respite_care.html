<p>Respite care may involve providing alternative family or institutional care
for a person with a disability in order to enable the carer to take a short
break, a holiday or a rest. It can cover very short-term respite, for example,
a carer for an evening, or a much longer arrangement for a holiday. Schemes of
respite care are sometimes called 'Breakaway' or 'Friendship' schemes.</p>

<p>Respite care or temporary care may be based in the community or in an
institution. In practice, respite care is provided to a varying degree at a
number of locations around the country â€“ in some cases by your Health Service
Executive (HSE) Area and in others by local or national voluntary
organisations.</p>

<p>Care is provided at a number of locations around the country for people with
different disabilities. The person being cared for may be admitted to a HSE
nursing home for a period of two weeks. Longer stays may be possible in some
circumstances. Respite care is organised through your <a shape="rect" href="../care_in_your_community/public_health_nurses.html">public health
nurse</a> or family doctor (GP). Alternative care with a family is sometimes
available for children with disabilities, whereas institutional care is usually
provided for older people. Sometimes, summer camp arrangements can be made for
children with disabilities. These are funded by local HSE Areas at no cost to
individuals.<br></p>

<div>

<div class="topic">

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If your accommodation or your daily living costs are provided by the Health
Service Executive (HSE), or by another provider on behalf of the HSE, you may
pay a Long-Stay Contribution towards these costs.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2017, long-stay charges are replaced by Long-Stay
Contributions. Where long-stay charges previously applied (where nursing care
is provided full-time or part-time), the same rates will apply for the
Long-Stay Contributions.</p>

<p>Long-Stay Contributions also apply to mental health and disability
residential support services provided by, or on behalf of, the HSE in
accommodation without a nursing or medical service. A lower rate of
Contribution applies in such accommodation.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You are being provided with <em>Residential Support Services</em> if your
accommodation or your daily living costs are provided by the HSE, or on behalf
of the HSE (but the Contributions described here don't apply if you are covered
by the Nursing Home Support Scheme or are receiving acute in-patient care).</p>

<p>You will generally have to pay a set amount towards these maintenance and
accommodation costs. This is called a <em>Long-Stay Contribution</em> (also
known as the <em>Residential Support Services Maintenance and Accommodation
Contribution</em>).</p>

<p>The Long-Stay Contribution applies if you have been getting Residential
Support Services for more than 30 days in the last 12 months. You only pay for
days when you get Residential Support Services from your provider (a day is
counted if you receive the services overnight, that is, at midnight).</p>

<p>The Contribution goes towards your accommodation and maintenance costs such
as heating, electricity, groceries or meals.</p>

<p>If you already pay rent or pay towards groceries, for example, into a
household fund, this can continue and be taken into account as part of your
Long-Stay Contribution.</p>

<p>If some or all of your daily living costs – food, utility bills and so on
– are provided for by the HSE, or on behalf of the HSE, but your
accommodation is not, your Contribution will be reduced by the amount of rent
you pay or by €30 a week, whichever is more.</p>

<p>If you have a medical card, you pay the Long-Stay Contribution towards your
food, utilities and accommodation as these are not covered by your medical
card.</p>

<h2>Assessment</h2>

<p>Your service provider will help you figure out how much you have to pay. You
will have an individual assessment to make sure that the amount you pay is
correct. You can be assisted by a family member or other advocate who can also
attend meetings with you.</p>

<p>If you paid long-stay charges:</p>
<ul><li>They are replaced with Long-Stay Contributions from 1 January 2017. Your
    service provider will arrange to assess your financial situation as soon as
    possible.</li>
  <li>The rate you pay is likely to be the same as before if your circumstances
    have not changed since your long-stay charge was set.</li>
  <li>If your service provider has not completed your assessment by 1 January
    2017, you will continue to pay the same rate. Your assessment must be
    completed by 1 July 2017 at the latest.</li>
  <li>If you overpay any amount from 1 January 2017 because your assessment has
    not been completed, your service provider will refund you.</li>
</ul><h3>Income assessed</h3>

<p>The income that is assessed is the amount you have left after deductions
such as tax and PRSI.</p>

<p>Income assessed includes:</p>
<ul><li>Department of Social Protection payments — except for the payments
    listed below under 'Excluded income'</li>
  <li>Income from your job, self-employment, trade, farming, profession or
    vocation</li>
  <li>Earnings above €120 a week from a rehabilitative job (for example, if
    you earn €130 a week, €10 a week will be included in the income
    assessment)</li>
  <li>Income from your pension including an occupational pension or overseas
    pension</li>
  <li>Rental income from property and land</li>
  <li>Income from fees, commissions, dividends, interest or income of a similar
    nature</li>
  <li>Payments under a legal settlement, a covenant or a will</li>
  <li>Maintenance payments</li>
  <li>Interest or dividends earned on savings (but only if your savings are
    over €15,000)</li>
  <li>Income from holding an office or directorship</li>
  <li>Income from royalties and annuities</li>
</ul><h3>Excluded income</h3>

<p>Income that is not taken into account in assessing your Contribution is
called excluded or disregarded income.</p>

<p>Income that is not your own is excluded (for example, the income of your
partner, spouse or other family member).</p>

<p>The first €120 a week of earnings from a rehabilitative job is also
disregarded.</p>

<p>For savings up to €15,000, any interest or dividends you earn are not
taken into account.</p>

<p>The following payments are disregarded:</p>
<ul><li>Family Income Supplement</li>
  <li>Child Benefit</li>
  <li>Carer's Allowance</li>
  <li>Domiciliary Care Allowance</li>
  <li>Rent supplement or accommodation subsidy</li>
  <li>Weekly supplements paid under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance
  scheme</li>
  <li>Increase for a Qualified Adult or Qualified Child</li>
  <li>Fuel, Island, and Living Alone Allowances</li>
  <li>Guardian's Payments</li>
  <li>Foster care allowance</li>
  <li>Mobility Allowance</li>
  <li>Third-level education maintenance grants</li>
  <li>Rehabilitation training allowance</li>
</ul><br><p>The following compensation payments are disregarded (along with any income
that comes from the payment):</p>
<ul><li>Any payment under the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions
    Act 2015 (for women who worked in, for example, Magdalen Laundries)</li>
  <li>Any ex-gratia payment under the Lourdes Hospital Redress Scheme 2007 or
    the Lourdes Hospital Payment Scheme</li>
  <li>Any ex-gratia payment under the Symphysiotomy Payment Scheme</li>
  <li>Certain payments for disability caused by Thalidomide</li>
</ul><br><p>When your assessment is finished, you will get a letter that tells you the
amount of your Long-Stay Contribution.</p>

<p>If your circumstances change, you should tell your service provider, who
will arrange an assessment to see if your Contribution should change.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The amount you contribute depends on:</p>
<ul><li>Your income.</li>
  <li>Your essential expenses. You may qualify for a waiver to ensure that what
    you pay will be within your means (see below).</li>
  <li>What type of accommodation you live in.</li>
</ul><p>There are 3 types of accommodation:</p>
<ul><li>Category A accommodation where there is full-time (24-hour) medical or
    nursing care</li>
  <li>Category B accommodation where there is part-time (less than 24-hour)
    medical or nursing care</li>
  <li>Category C accommodation (other accommodation, such as independent living
    settings)</li>
</ul><br><p>There is a maximum rate of Contribution. If your income is over a certain
amount you pay the maximum rate. If your income is lower you pay less. The
Contribution rates for each income band are set out in the tables in <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/si/58/made/en/print">Statutory
Instrument No. 58 of 2017</a> (this changed the income bands, from March 2017,
so that the contribution rate is not affected by increases in social welfare
payment rates). </p>

choose to agree to pay the maximum Contribution without having to submit your
income details or go through the assessment process.</p>
<br><p>You are entitled to have a minimum amount of money left for your personal
use after paying the Long-Stay Contribution.</p>

<table border="1"><caption><strong>Amount for personal use</strong></caption>

<br><p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>If your only income is Disability Allowance of €193, the table of
Contribution rates shows that the most you will have to pay each week is:</p>
<ul><li>€155 if you are in Category A accommodation</li>
  <li>€120 if you are in Category B accommodation</li>
  <li>€70 if you are in Category C accommodation</li>
</ul><h2>Waiver</h2>

<p>You can apply for a waiver if you have essential expenses and would find it
difficult to afford the standard Contribution rate for your income. If you have
a waiver it is an agreement that you will pay a reduced Long-Stay Contribution
or no Long-Stay Contribution. Your financial circumstances and the needs set
out in your care plan will be considered.</p>

<p>The waiver assessment takes into account:</p>
<ul><li>Payments you already make for your maintenance and accommodation.</li>
  <li>Expenses to meet your medical, therapeutic, rehabilitative or
    health-related needs (including needs set out in your care plan).</li>
  <li>Your essential expenses. This includes the reasonable expenses of your
    dependants. It also includes your financial commitments such as rent or
    mortgage payments for the family home, maintenance payments or repayments
    on existing loans.</li>
</ul><p>Your service provider will tell you what documents you need to provide with
your request for a waiver, such as bills, receipts, bank statements and pay
slips. However, if you do not have all these documents with you during your
individual assessment, you can provide any outstanding documents as soon as
possible afterwards so that your service provider can finish the assessment.</p>

<p>When your assessment is finished, you will get a letter that tells you the
amount of the Long-Stay Contribution you have to pay, whether you have a waiver
or not, the amount of the waiver (if any), and an explanation.</p>

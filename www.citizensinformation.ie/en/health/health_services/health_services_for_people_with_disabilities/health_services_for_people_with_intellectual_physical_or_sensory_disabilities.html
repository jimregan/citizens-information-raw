<p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) provides a range of services for people
with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities or autism. These services
include basic health services as well as assessment, rehabilitation, income
maintenance, community care and residential care.</p>

<p>Some services are provided directly by the HSE. Many of the community,
residential and rehabilitative training services are provided by voluntary
organisations with grant aid from the HSE. The level of service varies
considerably throughout the country. </p>

<p>HSE Administrative Areas have appointed Disability Services Managers to
co-ordinate the delivery of services to people with disabilities.</p>

<h3>General health services</h3>

<p>People with disabilities are entitled to general health services on the same
basis as everyone else. These services include:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="../entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">Medical
    cards</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../entitlement_to_health_services/prescribed_drugs_and_medicines.html">Prescribed
    drugs, medicines, medical aids and appliances</a> </li>

  <li><a shape="rect" href="../dental_aural_and_optical_services/dental_services.html">Dental
    services</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../dental_aural_and_optical_services/optometric_and_ophthalmic_services.html">optical
    services</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../dental_aural_and_optical_services/aural_services.html">aural
    services</a> </li>
</ul><h3>Community care services</h3>

<p>People with disabilities are entitled to avail of the range of <a href="../care_in_your_community/community_care_services.html">community care
services</a>. In many cases, they have priority in access to the services. </p>

<h3>Residential care</h3>

<p>People with disabilities who are unable to live at home may be provided with
residential services directly by the HSE or, on its behalf, by voluntary
organisations that are funded by the HSE. A residential service is where
someone lives most or all of the time. <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/olderpeople/residentialcare/Long_Stay_Charges/">Long
stay charges</a> may apply.</p>

<p>The HSE has appointed an independent <a href="http://www.hse.ie/confidential/">Confidential Recipient</a> to whom
anyone can make a complaint or raise concerns about the care and treatment of
any vulnerable person receiving residential care that is funded by the HSE.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.hiqa.ie/">Health Information and Quality
Authority</a> (HIQA) regulates all residential services for children and adults
with disabilities, whether provided by the HSE, voluntary groups or private
organisations.</p>

<p>These may include:</p>
<ul><li>Institutions, which usually provide accommodation for 10 or more
  people</li>
  <li>Clustered housing, or housing associated with an institution (it may be
    on the grounds of or near the institution)</li>
  <li>Supported community living, which is houses within an ordinary
    neighbourhood that may have supports for the people with disabilities
    living there</li>
  <li>Residential <a href="respite_care.html">respite services</a></li>
</ul><p>HIQA has set <a href="http://hiqa.ie/standards/social/people-with-disabilities">National
Standards for Residential Services for Children and Adults with
Disabilities</a>. It is responsible for registering, inspecting and monitoring
residential services.</p>

<p>HIQA does not have the legal power to investigate individual complaints but
it does have a <a href="https://www.hiqa.ie/concern-about-services">process for
raising concerns</a> about a service and it examines any information it
receives.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.healthcomplaints.ie/">Healthcomplaints.ie</a> has more
information about raising concerns about residential services.</p>

disabilities, in health and other areas, see the <a href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/downloads/guides/Guide_to_entitlements_for_people_with_disabilities_2016.pdf">Guide

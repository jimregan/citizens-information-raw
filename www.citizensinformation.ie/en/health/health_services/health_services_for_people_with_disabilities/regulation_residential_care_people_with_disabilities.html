<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Residential services for people with disabilities are required to meet
certain standards. These standards apply to residential services, including
respite services, whether they are run by the Health Service Executive (HSE) or
by other public, private or voluntary bodies that are funded or assisted by the
HSE.</p>

<p>The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) is responsible for the
registration and inspection of residential services for children and adults
with disabilities. All designated centres for people with disabilities are
required to register with HIQA.</p>

<p>Residential services are inspected against the National Standards for
Residential Services for Children and Adults with Disabilities and are checked
to ensure that they comply with regulations.</p>

<p>Reports are published after every inspection. <a href="https://www.hiqa.ie/social-care/find-a-centre/inspection-reports">Inspection
reports are available to download</a> from the Health Information and Quality
Authorityâ€™s website, <a href="http://hiqa.ie/">hiqa.ie</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l3bacf">Standards</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.hiqa.ie/node/33">National Standards for Residential
Services for Children and Adults with Disabilities</a> outline what is expected
of a provider of services and what a resident, their family, a carer, or the
public can expect to receive in residential care settings for people with
disabilities.</p>

<p>The Standards are grouped under 8 key themes. The first 4 relate to quality
and safety:</p>
<ul><li>Individualised supports and care</li>
  <li>Effective services</li>
  <li>Safe services</li>
  <li>Health and development</li>
</ul><br><p>And 4 relate to capacity and capability:</p>
<ul><li>Leadership, governance and management</li>
  <li>Use of resources</li>
  <li>Responsive workforce</li>
  <li>Use of information</li>
</ul><br><p>HIQA has published a <a href="https://www.hiqa.ie/system/files/Standards-Disabilities-Children-Adults-Plain-English.pdf">guide
to the Standards</a> and there is an <a href="https://www.hiqa.ie/system/files/Standards-Res-Disabilities-Adults-Guide.pdf">easy
to read version of the Standards for adults</a>, an <a href="https://www.hiqa.ie/system/files/Standards-Res-Disabilities-Children-Guide.pdf">easy

version of the Standards</a>.</p>

<h2>Registration</h2>

<p>To be given a registration certificate to operate a residential service for
people with disabilities, a service provider must show that it meets the
relevant standards and legal requirements and is able to meet the needs of the
residents.</p>

<p>Services must register with HIQA and will be inspected to ensure that all
services are of a consistently high quality. Services must re-register every 3
years.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l0e153">Inspections</h2>

<p>Residential services will be inspected against the National Standards and
against relevant legislation and regulations. Inspections may be announced or
unannounced and may be during the day, in the evenings, at weekends or at
night.</p>

<p>During an inspection visit, inspectors talk to the children and adults who
live in the residential service and their families and with managers, staff and
interested people who wish to speak to them. Inspectors focus on the experience
of the person living in the residential service and what it is like to live
there. They also observe daily routines, the quality of the accommodation and
meals, and other aspects of daily life.</p>

<p>If HIQA inspectors find that a service is unsafe, or the National Standards
and regulations are not being met, it will have the legal power to take a
number of actions in the interest of the residents. These may include the
addition of registration conditions, refusal to register the service,
prosecution or cancellation of registration.</p>

<h2>Reports</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.hiqa.ie/social-care/find-a-centre/inspection-reports">Inspection
reports are published on the HIQA website</a>. Inspection reports give
information about the residential services, the number of places and the
general facilities. The findings of the inspection are outlined, highlighting
where standards of care are good and where improvements are required. The
report identifies any necessary actions that are required to be taken.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lb09df">Complaints</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.hiqa.ie/concern-about-services">You can provide
information to HIQA if you have a concern about a service</a>.</p>

<p>HIQA has no legal remit to investigate specific complaints but all
unsolicited information received is assessed and taken into account in its
monitoring activities which could include, for example, requesting the service
provider to carry out an investigation or provide information.</p>

<p>HIQA provides an information leaflet about <a href="https://www.hiqa.ie/system/files/Responding-to-concerns-disability-services.pdf">Responding

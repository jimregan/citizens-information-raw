<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.hiqa.ie/">The Health Information and
Quality Authority (HIQA)</a> is responsible for the registration and inspection
of all residential care services for older people. Services are required to
meet certain standards that include rules about the quality of accommodation
and care. </p>

<p>All services, including public as well as private and voluntary nursing
homes, are subject to this independent registration and inspection. </p>

<p>Before July 2009 the Health Service Executive (HSE) was responsible for the
registration and inspection of private and voluntary residential care services
and provided <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/publications/olderpeople/Nursing_Home_Reports/">inspection
reports up to that date</a>. </p>

<h3>Registration and inspection</h3>

<p>Services are only allowed to operate if they are registered by HIQA and they
are inspected regularly to ensure that they maintain a high level of care. </p>

<p>HIQA inspect residential services and re-register each centre every 3 years.
The inspections are a mixture of both announced and unannounced visits. These
happen by day and also in the evenings, at weekends and at night. </p>

<p>The registration and inspection process is completely independent and
reports are published after every inspection. These inspection reports provide
information to the residents themselves, their families and the general public
about the standards of care in individual centres. </p>

<p>You can view the <a href="http://www.hiqa.ie/resource-centre/registered-centres">registers of
residential centres for older people</a> and the current <a href="http://www.hiqa.ie/social-care/find-a-centre/inspection-reports?field_report_type_centre_value_many_to_one=reportolderpeoples">inspection
reports</a> on the HIQA website. </p>

<h3>Contract of care</h3>

<p>Before you go into residential care, a contract of care is agreed between
you and the residential care service. This contract sets out the terms that are
to govern your care and welfare and must include details of the services to be
provided and the fees to be charged. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l3bacf">Standards</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.hiqa.ie/system/files/National-Standards-for-Older-People.pdf">National
Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland (pdf)</a>
are intended to help to ensure that the needs of people living in residential
accommodation are met. There is also a <a href="https://www.hiqa.ie/system/files/National-Standards-for-Older-People-Guide.pdf">guide
to the standards (pdf)</a>and <a href="http://www.hiqa.ie/system/files/Res_Care_Standards_Older_People_DL_09.pdf">a
leaflet on registration and inspection (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>There are 35 standards which aim to help people participate in, and
contribute to, daily life.</p>

<p>These include:</p>
<ul><li>Promoting the rights of people and respecting their autonomy, privacy and
    dignity</li>
  <li>Facilitating people to be as independent as possible and to exercise
    personal choice in their daily lives</li>
  <li>Safeguarding and protecting people from abuse</li>
  <li>Providing people with information and assessment so that appropriate
    supports are made available to meet their needs</li>
</ul><br><p>The 35 standards are grouped into 8 themes.</p>

<p>Four of the themes relate to quality and safety:</p>
<ul><li>Person-centred care and support</li>
  <li>Effective services</li>
  <li>Safe services</li>
  <li>Health and wellbeing</li>
</ul><br><p>Four of the themes relate to the ability to deliver improvements in
quality:</p>
<ul><li>Leadership, governance and management</li>
  <li>Use of resources</li>
  <li>Responsive workforce</li>
  <li>Use of information</li>
</ul></div>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lb09df">Complaints</h2>

<p>If you, a member of your family or someone acting on your behalf have
concerns about your care, you should first try to resolve these at a local
level, with the management of the care service.</p>

<p>Legislation states that all care providers must have procedures for handling
complaints and must provide information about how you can make a complaint. If
you are unhappy with the response you get from your provider or local HSE
office, you can share this information with HIQA.</p>

<p>HIQA do not have the power to investigate individual complaints but you can
<a href="http://www.hiqa.ie/social-care/using-care-services/reporting-concern">report
any concerns you have to HIQA</a>. HIQA can use the information to decide
whether the service is meeting the national standards and regulations, and to
check whether the service is meeting the needs of the people who live there. If
HIQA find they are not, they can take action to make sure that services are
improved.</p>

<p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for the delivery of
public health community and home care supports at local level, including the
Home Care Package scheme. </p>

<h3>What is the Home Care Package scheme? </h3>

<p>The Home Care Package (HCP) scheme is an administrative scheme, operated by
the HSE. It aims to help people who need medium to high caring support to
continue to live at home independently. The Home Care Package scheme is not
established in law; as it is an administrative scheme, you do not have an
automatic right to the scheme, or to avail of services under the scheme.</p>

<p>The HSE operates <a href="http://lenus.ie/hse/bitstream/10147/120850/1/hcpsguidelines.pdf">national
guidelines</a> on how to qualify for the HCP scheme. The scheme is not means
tested, and there is no charge or contribution to be paid for the services
provided.</p>

<p>Each HSE Area has responsibility for the operation of the scheme within the
resources allocated for it in that area. This means that the level of service
or support you receive as part of a HCP may vary in different parts of the
country depending on the local population, your individual needs, who is
available to deliver services and the demand for the scheme. Check with your <a href="http://hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">Local Health Office</a> for more
details on the scheme in your area. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>What does the Home Care Package scheme consist of? </h3>

<p>Each support package is tailored to your individual needs. The package may
include the services of nurses, <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/care_in_your_community/home_helps.html">home
helps</a> and various therapies including <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/care_in_your_community/physiotherapy_services.html">physiotherapy</a>
and <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/care_in_your_community/occupational_therapy_services.html">occupational
therapy</a> services. You might also receive some respite care or aids or
appliances as part of your HCP if these are needed to support you to stay in
your own home. The services that are supplied will depend on your needs, as
assessed by the HSE, and the levels of other supports available to you, such as
family members or friends.</p>

<p>Your individual Package will vary according to your medical condition, the
level of care required and the supports you already have available to you. For
example, there might be a greater emphasis in some Packages on home help
services (personal and/or domestic care) while other Packages may require a
greater level of therapy and nursing, depending on individual need.</p>

<p>The HSE may provide a Home Care Package as a short-term arrangement, for
example, when you are recovering following a stay in hospital, during an
illness or while you are recuperating. A HCP may also be provided to help you
with the activities of daily living over a longer term.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Who is the Home Care Package scheme for? </h3>

<p>The main priority of the HCP scheme is older people living in the community
or who are in-patients in acute hospitals and at risk of admission to long-term
care. </p>

<p>Home Care Packages may also be available to those older people who have been
admitted to long-term care and who can (with support), return to the community.
Packages may also be offered to people who are already using existing care
services, such as home helps, but who may need more assistance to continue to
live in their community. </p>

<p>Home Care Packages may also be available occasionally for younger people
whose needs would be best met by access to older people's services, for
example, in the situation of early-onset dementia. </p>

<h3>How does a Home Care Package work? </h3>

<p>The type of Package available will depend on the needs of the individual
concerned. The HSE is working on standardising a national needs assessment of
all individuals.</p>

<p>In the meantime the HSE has implemented an interim approach to the standard
assessment of the needs of people who apply for this scheme. In most cases,
your public health nurse will do a Care Needs Assessment and will work out with
you and your family how your needs would be most appropriately met.</p>

<p>The general rule is that if you need more than 5 hours' home help service
per week, you can apply to be considered for a HCP. The number of hours and
types of support or services approved by the HSE will again depend on your
individual needs.</p>
Services may be provided by the HSE directly, or by certain non-HSE providers.
These are voluntary (not for profit) and private (for profit) organisations
that have been approved by the HSE to provide Home Care Packages. The non-HSE
providers have been assessed by the HSE as demonstrating that they could
achieve new minimum standards required on its behalf.<br><h3>What does the Care Needs Assessment involve?</h3>

<p>A Care Needs Assessment identifies your overall health needs and your level
of dependency. It will be done by a health care worker, such as, for example, a
public health nurse or physiotherapist etc. The assessment will look at your
needs, including:</p>

<p>•Your ability to carry out the activities of daily living, for example,
bathing, shopping, dressing and moving around</p>

<p>•Any medical, health and personal social services being provided to you</p>

<p>•Your family, social and community supports</p>

<p>•Your wishes and preferences.</p>

<p>The assessment may include a physical examination by a healthcare
professional. A report will be prepared to record your care needs and a copy
can be provided to you.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Home Care Packages are tailored to meet individual needs. This means that
services vary. Typical packages of support available under the scheme may be
worth between €350-500 per week in respect of each patient, depending on
individual need. As outlined above, the Package may consist of: </p>
<ul><li>Services provided directly by the HSE, or </li>
  <li>Services provided on behalf of the HSE by a non-HSE provider, or </li>
  <li>A combination of the above. </li>
</ul><p>However, if you arrange services or supports above the levels provided by
the HSE or if you do not qualify for a Home Care Package you will have to pay
for the cost of those services yourself. If you employ someone in your home
(such as a private carer) funded from your own resources, you become their
employer. As an employer, you have various duties and obligations. Revenue has
a useful leaflet on the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it_53.pdf">Domestic
EmployerScheme (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>There are <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/tax_relief_for_employing_a_home_carer.html">tax
concessions</a> if you pay part or all of the costs yourself.<br></p>

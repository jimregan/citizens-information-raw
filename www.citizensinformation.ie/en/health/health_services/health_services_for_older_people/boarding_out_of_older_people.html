<p>The <a href="../../health_system/health_boards.html">Health Service
Executive</a> (HSE) may make arrangements for the boarding out of dependent
people in a private house and for payment for all or part of the costs. The
Boarding Out Scheme is not available in all areas.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The HSE must satisfy itself that the house is suitable for the person to be
boarded out and that the householder is a fit person to look after the person
in question. The householder must provide suitable and sufficient care,
nutritious and varied food, and adequate attendance, having regard to the needs
of the person. He or she must also respect the privacy of the person boarded
out. Not more than six people can be boarded out in one house. Regulations set
out standards as to accommodation, cleanliness, safety and other related
matters. </p>

<p>The HSE pays the householder an amount of not more than half the weekly rate
of <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/older_and_retired_people/state_pension_non_contributory.html">State
Pension (non-contributory)</a> payable at the time. In addition, the person
boarded out must pay an amount as agreed with the HSE and the householder.</p>

<h3>Complaints</h3>

<p>A person boarded out (or somebody acting on his or her behalf) may make a
complaint to the <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">Local
Health Office</a> in relation to any matter concerning the residence or the
maintenance, care and welfare of the person.</p>

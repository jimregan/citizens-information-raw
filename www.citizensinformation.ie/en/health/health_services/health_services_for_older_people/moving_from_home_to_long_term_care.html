<p>The issue of moving from home to long stay institutional care usually arises
when people are older. A small number of younger people may also face the
problem of being unable to continue to live at home because of the onset of
disability or the progression of a chronic illness. </p>

<p>The vast majority of older people are able to live in their own homes with
some support from their families, neighbours and the health and community care
services. A number of people every year however find they cannot continue to
live at home and need to go into long-term care. </p>

<p>Here we outline some information that may help you to continue to live at
home or make that transition to long stay care, should it become necessary or
desirable. This information is a broad overview of the services and supports
available and your entitlements. More detailed information on these issues is
available through the links below. </p>

<h3>Supports to help you continue to live at home</h3>

<p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) provide a range of <a shape="rect" href="../care_in_your_community/community_care_services.html">community care
services</a> to enable you to continue to live at home. The help you can get

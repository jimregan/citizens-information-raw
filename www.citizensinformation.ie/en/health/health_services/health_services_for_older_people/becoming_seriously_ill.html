<p>While the vast majority of retired people enjoy a healthy life, there are
some who suffer illness and disability and may need care. Some may have retired
because of the onset of illness or disability. The payments and services to
which you are entitled depend on your age and on your needs. The Department of
Social Protection (DSP) is responsible for the payments mentioned below except
where otherwise stated.</p>

<h3 style="border: medium none;">Income supports for older people</h3>

<p><strong>Pensioners</strong></p>

<p>If you are already a pensioner when you become ill or acquire a disability,
your income arrangements do not change; you continue to receive your pension
and other entitlements. </p>

<p><strong>Employed</strong></p>

<p>If you are employed you may continue to be paid by your employer but this
depends on your contract of employment. Employers are not obliged to pay
employees who are unable to work because of illness but some contracts of
employment include provisions for payment while ill. This applies regardless of
age.</p>

<p><strong>Aged Under 66</strong></p>

<p>If you become ill and unable to work before the age of 66, you may be
eligible for <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/disability-and-illness/disability_benefit" shape="rect">Illness Benefit</a>. Your GP will have application forms. </p>

<p>Illness Benefit is based on PRSI contributions. If you do not qualify
because you do not have enough PRSI contributions or because you are
self-employed, you may be eligible for a weekly <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow" shape="rect">Supplementary Welfare Allowance</a>. </p>

<p>If your illness or disability arises from a work-related accident or illness
you may qualify for <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/disability-and-illness/injury_benefit" shape="rect">Occupational Injuries Benefit</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Long-term illness and disability</strong></p>

<p>If you have a long-term illness or disability and cannot continue to work,
you may be able to claim your occupational or personal pension scheme if you
have one and you may qualify for Illness Benefit. If you remain unable to work
for a year or more you may qualify for <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/disability-and-illness/invalidity_pension" shape="rect">Invalidity Pension</a>. If you do not qualify for Illness Benefit
or Invalidity Pension, you may apply for the means-tested <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/disability-and-illness/disability_allowance" shape="rect">Disability Allowance</a>.</p>

<p>If you qualify for Invalidity Pension or Disability Allowance, you may also
qualify for <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/extra-social-welfare-benefits/free_travel" shape="rect">Free Travel</a> and the <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/extra-social-welfare-benefits/household_benefits_package" shape="rect">Household Benefits Package</a>. If you have problems paying your
rent, you may be able to get <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html" shape="rect">Rent Supplement</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allowance_scheme.html">Supplementary
Welfare Allowance scheme</a> may also provide help with various costs such as
heating, exceptional needs and urgent needs.</p>

<h3>Housing options</h3>

<p>There are a number of <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/older_people_housing" shape="rect">housing grants available for older people</a> and people with
disabilities. If your home needs to be adapted to enable you to continue to
live there, you may qualify for the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a
Disability. The adaptations could include adding on an extra room, making the
house wheelchair accessible or putting in a ground-floor bathroom and toilet.
Apply to your local authority. The Health Service Executive (HSE) also provides
grants under the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme and the Mobility Aids
Grant Scheme.</p>

<p>If your own home is unsuitable you may be able to get a specially adapted
local authority house for older people and people with disabilities, or an
adapted house provided by a voluntary housing organisation. The availability of
such houses and eligibility for them vary around the country.</p>

<h3>Care at home</h3>

<p>If you are in need of care, the HSE may provide it or help you to pay for
it. Your carer may also be able to get a payment from the Department of Social
Protection. </p>

<p><strong>Help with home care</strong></p>

<p>If you need support in order to enable you to continue to live at home, you
may be able to get help from the Community Care Services section of the HSE.

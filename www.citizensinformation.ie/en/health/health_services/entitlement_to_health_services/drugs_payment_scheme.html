<p>Under the Drugs Payment Scheme you pay a maximum of €144 in a calendar
month for approved <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/prescribed_drugs_and_medicines.html">prescribed
drugs, medicines and certain appliances</a> for use by yourself and your family
in that month. If a <a href="prescribed_drugs_and_medicines.html">reference
price</a> has been set for the drugs you are prescribed, this is the price that
the HSE will use to calculate your monthly drugs costs. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>In order to qualify for this scheme, you must be ordinarily resident in
Ireland. Being ordinarily resident in Ireland means that you have been living
here for a minimum of one year or that you intend to live here for a minimum of
one year.</p>

<p>The scheme covers the person who applied, his or her spouse/partner, and
children aged under 18 (or under 23 if in full-time education). A dependant who
is living in the household and has a physical or mental disability or illness
and is unable to fully maintain himself/herself, may be included in the family
expenditure regardless of age. </p>

<p>When you register for the scheme, your Local Health Office will issue a
plastic swipe card for each person named on the registration form. You should
present this card whenever you are having prescriptions filled. </p>

<h3>Using the card</h3>

<p>You do not have to register with a particular pharmacy for the scheme but
for convenience it is advisable to use the same pharmacy in a particular month
if you wish to avoid paying more than the maximum €144. </p>

<h3>Claiming a refund for amounts over the threshold</h3>

<p>If you pay over the maximum, for example because you need to use two or more
pharmacies in one month, you can apply for a refund of the amount above the
threshold.</p>

<p>To apply for a refund, get a claim form from your <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">Local Health Office</a>,
online at <a href="http://www.drugspayment.ie">drugspayment.ie</a>, or by
calling 1890 252 919. Return the completed claim form to the address given on
the form. You can check the status of your application for a refund at <a href="http://www.drugspayment.ie">drugspayment.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>Expired Drugs Payment Scheme Cards</h3>

<p>Drugs Payment Scheme Cards are issued for a limited time (generally 5
years). When your card expires, you must apply again to obtain a new card. You
can get the forms from your local pharmacy or from your Local Health Office.
</p>

<h3>Lost or stolen Drugs Payment Scheme Cards</h3>
If your Drugs Payment Scheme Card is lost, stolen or damaged, you should
contact your Local Health Office. </div>

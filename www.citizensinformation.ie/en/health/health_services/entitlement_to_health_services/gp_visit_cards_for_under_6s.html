<p>Children under the age of 6 are entitled to free visits to a participating
GP.</p>

<p>In addition to free GP visits, the GP visit card for children under 6 covers
specific assessments at age 2 and 5 and care for children with asthma.</p>

<p>These assessments are preventive checks that include charting age, weight
and height and taking appropriate follow-up action.</p>

<p>The asthma checks will assess your child’s asthma and review their
medications, including ensuring that your child is using inhalers correctly. A
written plan will be given to you to help you manage your child’s asthma. The
initial check takes place when asthma is diagnosed in a child over 2 years of
age, followed by another check in the following 3 months and then annually
until the child reaches the age of 6.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>All children under 6 who live or intend to live in Ireland for at least 1
year are eligible.</p>

<p>Your child will be included in this scheme until the end of the month of
your child’s 6th birthday. The date that the card is valid until is shown on
the card. You will be notified approximately 3 months before it is due to
expire.</p>

<p>The card covers free GP visits, including home visits and out of hours,
urgent GP care. GPs provide these services as part of a <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/about/Who/gmscontracts/under6GPcontract/">contract
with the Health Service Executive (HSE)</a>.</p>

<p>If your child already has a <a href="medical_card.html">medical card</a>,
there is no need to register them for inclusion in this scheme while they
continue to be eligible for a medical card. However if your family
circumstances change in the future and your family is no longer eligible for
medical cards, you can then register your children for GP visit cards for
children under 6.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you have any questions before registering, you can phone Lo-call 1890 252
919.</p>

<p>To register, you will need:</p>
<ul><li>Your <a href="../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">Personal
    Public Service (PPS) Number</a></li>
  <li>The PPS Number of each child</li>
  <li>Your choice of participating GP</li>
</ul><p>You are sent your child’s PPS Number after registering their birth. If you
do not have a PPS Number for your child, contact Client Identity Services in
the Department of Social Protection on Lo-call 1890 927 999, or email <a href="mailto:cis@welfare.ie">cis@welfare.ie</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not have a PPS Number and your baby is under 2 months of age, you
can register by leaving the PPS Number blank and the HSE will write to you
separately to get it.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="http://www.pcrsonline.ie/libr/html/UGP_GPlist_by_LHO.pdf">list of GPs
that are taking part in the scheme (pdf)</a>. The list also tells you whether
your chosen GP accepts online registrations. </p>

<p>If they do, you can apply online at <a href="http://www.gpvisitcard.ie/">gpvisitcard.ie</a>. If a GP doesn’t accept
online registrations, or if you prefer to use a paper form, you can download
the <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/mc/gpvc/under6applicationform.pdf">GP
Visit Card Under 6s Registration Form (pdf)</a>, bring it to the GP to sign,
and then send it to:</p>

<p>GP Visit Card – Under 6s<br>
PO Box 12629<br>
Dublin 11</p>

<p>If you have used the online registration facility, you can login to your
previously registered account to update or add additional information.
Alternatively, you can complete another registration form to do this.</p>

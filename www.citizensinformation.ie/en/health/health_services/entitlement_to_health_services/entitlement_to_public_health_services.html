<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Entitlement to health services is primarily based on residency and means,
rather than on your payment of tax or pay-related <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social
insurance</a> (PRSI). Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by
the Health Service Executive (HSE) as being ordinarily resident in Ireland has
eligibility to health services. You are ordinarily resident if you are living
in Ireland and have lived here, or intend to live here, for at least one
year.</p>

<p>Depending on their circumstances, <a href="health_services_and_visitors_to_ireland.html">short-term visitors to
Ireland may be entitled to health services</a> that are free or subsidised.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>There are two types of eligibility for people who are ordinarily
resident:</p>
<ul><li>Full eligibility for medical card holders</li>
  <li>Limited eligibility for people who don't have a medical card</li>
</ul><h3>Medical card holders</h3>

<p>If you have a <a shape="rect" href="medical_card.html">medical card</a>, you
are entitled to:</p>
<ul><li>Free <a shape="rect" href="../gp_services/gp_services_to_medical_card_holders.html">GP
    services</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="prescribed_drugs_and_medicines.html">Prescribed

    and <a shape="rect" href="../dental_aural_and_optical_services/aural_services.html">aural</a>

  <li><a shape="rect" href="../women_s_health/maternity_and_infant_welfare_services.html">Maternity

  <li><a shape="rect" href="../care_in_your_community/community_care_services.html">Community

</ul><h3>Non-medical card holders</h3>

<p>If you do not have a medical card, you are entitled to free public hospital
services but you may have to pay in-patient and out-patient <a shape="rect" href="../hospital_services/hospital_charges.html">hospital charges</a>. You are
also entitled to subsidised <a href="prescribed_drugs_and_medicines.html">prescribed drugs and
medicines</a> and <a href="../women_s_health/maternity_and_infant_welfare_services.html">maternity
and infant care services</a>. </p>

<p>Unless you hold a <a shape="rect" href="gp_visit_cards.html">GP visit
card</a>, you are not entitled to free GP services.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to some <a shape="rect" href="../care_in_your_community/community_care_services.html">community care
and personal social services</a>.</p>

<h3>General health services</h3>

<p>There are certain general health services that are available to people on
the basis of their need or health status rather than on whether they have a
medical card or not. </p>

<p>For example: </p>
<ul><li>People who qualify for the <a shape="rect" href="../related_benefits_and_entitlements/long_term_illness_scheme.html">Long
    Term Illness Scheme</a> are entitled to get the drugs and medicines for the
    treatment of that illness free of charge </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../children_s_health/child_health_services.html">Child health
    services</a> are available to all children </li>
  <li>People who have contracted Hepatitis C through blood transfusion and have
    a <a href="../blood_and_organ_donation/hepatitis_c_and_health_amendment_act_cards.html">Health
    Amendment Act Card</a>  </li>
</ul><h3>Establishing ordinary residency</h3>

<p>If you are coming to live in Ireland or returning here to live, you must
satisfy the Health Service Executive (HSE) that you are "ordinarily resident"
â€“ that you are living in Ireland and intend to live here for at least one
year.</p>

<p>To establish that a person is ordinarily resident the HSE may require:</p>
<ul><li>Proof of property purchase or rental, including evidence that the
    property in question is the person's principal residence </li>
  <li>Evidence of transfer of funds, bank accounts, pensions etc. </li>
  <li>A residence permit or visa </li>
  <li>A work permit or visa, statements from employers etc </li>
  <li>In some instances, the signing of an <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/witnesses/affidavit.html">affidavit</a> (a sworn written
    statement) by the applicant </li>
</ul><p>Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the HSE as being
ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility (Category
1, i.e. <a href="medical_card.html">medical card</a> holders) or limited
eligibility (Category 2) for health services.</p>

<p>The fact that a non-EU national has established their eligibility for health
services does not automatically mean that their dependants are also eligible.
Dependants of non-EU nationals may also have to satisfy the above
requirements.</p>

<h3>EU citizens</h3>

<p>You may qualify for a medical card under EU rules if you are ordinarily
resident in Ireland and you are getting a social security pension from another
EU/EEA country or Switzerland, or if you are working and paying social
insurance in one of these countries.</p>

<p>You must not be subject to Irish social security legislation. This means
that you must not be in receipt of a contributory Irish social welfare payment
or be working in Ireland and be liable to pay PRSI.</p>

<p>If you are living in Ireland and you are the dependant of a pensioner
entitled under EU Regulations, or are the dependant of a person who is working
in another country covered by the Regulations, you may be eligible for a
medical card. You must not be subject to Irish social security legislation (in
the case of child dependants this rule applies to the spouse or person looking
after them).</p>

<p>Posted workers and their dependants may also qualify for the medical card.
These are workers who are employed in another country covered by the
regulations but are sent by their employers to work in Ireland for a limited
time.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/mc/forms/medicalcardguidelines2015.pdf">medical
card assessment guidelines (pdf)</a> for more information about entitlement
under EU Regulations.</p>

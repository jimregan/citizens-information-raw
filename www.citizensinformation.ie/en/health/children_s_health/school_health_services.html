<p>School health screenings are conducted by <a shape="rect" href="../care_in_your_community/public_health_nurses.html">public health
nurses</a> and area medical officers who are employed by the HSE. These
screenings are carried out on the school premises and the school principal is
told of the date of the screenings in advance so parents can be notified and
parents are entitled to be present if they wish. Children's hearing and vision
are examined and where requested by the parent or deemed necessary, a physical
examination may be carried out. </p>

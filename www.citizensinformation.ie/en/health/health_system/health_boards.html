<p>Health and personal social services are delivered by the Health Service
Executive (HSE), through medical professionals and hospitals and through a
network of <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">Local Health
Offices</a>, health centres and clinics at community level. </p>

<p>Health services can be broadly defined as those services that are concerned
with the</p>
<ul><li>Promotion of good health </li>
  <li>Prevention of illness (for example, food safety services, immunisation
    and vaccinations services, health screening, infant and child health
    services) </li>
  <li>The diagnosis and treatment of illness (for example, family doctor (GP)
    services, hospital services) </li>
</ul><p>Community care and personal social services can be broadly defined as those
that are designed to enable people to remain living in their communities,
especially when they have difficulties doing so because of illness, disability
or age. Examples include home nursing services, home helps, occupational
therapy and social work services.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l5f213">Provision of health and personal social

<ul><li>Acute hospitals</li>
  <li>Social care</li>
  <li>Mental health</li>
  <li>Primary care</li>
  <li>Health and wellbeing</li>
  <li>National Ambulance Service</li>
</ul><p>The <strong>Acute Hospitals Division</strong> works directly with acute
hospitals across the country. Public hospitals are organised into 7 Hospital
Groups – see below.</p>

<p>The <strong>Social Care Division</strong> supports people to live
independently who may otherwise may have difficulty in doing so due to illness
or disability. Services are delivered directly by the HSE or through agencies
funded by the HSE.</p>

<p>The <strong>Mental Health Division</strong> has responsibility for
area-based mental health services (inpatient centres and community-based
teams), child and adolescent mental health, general adult mental health,
psychiatry of old age, the National Forensic Mental Health Service, the
National Counselling Service and the National Office for Suicide Prevention.</p>

<p>The <strong>Primary Care Division</strong> aims to ensure that the vast
majority of people who require healthcare are managed within primary care and
community-based settings of a high standard.</p>

<p>The <strong>Health and Wellbeing Division</strong> covers the areas of
public health, heath protection, child health, national screening programmes,
health promotion and improvement, environmental health and emergency
management.</p>

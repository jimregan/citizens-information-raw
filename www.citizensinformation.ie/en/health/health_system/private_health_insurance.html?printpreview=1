<p>A number of companies offer voluntary private health insurance in Ireland.
</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.glohealth.ie/">GloHealth</a> was taken over by Irish
    Life Health in 2016. GloHealth customers will be invited to join Irish Life
    Health as their policies come up for renewal.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.hsf.ie/">HSF Health Plan</a> (provides <a href="http://www.hia.ie/consumer-information/fixed-health-insurance-cash-plans">cash
    benefit plans</a> but not in-patient health insurance)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.irishlifehealth.ie/">Irish Life Health</a> (formerly
    Aviva Health)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.layahealthcare.ie/">Laya Healthcare</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.vhi.ie/">VHI Healthcare</a></li>
</ul><p>There are a number of long-established health insurance providers that deal
only with particular groups of employees; membership is confined to employees
and retired employees and their dependants. These schemes are known as
restricted membership schemes. Examples include the Gardaí, prison officers
and ESB employees. The rules governing health insurance apply equally to all
providers with some limited exceptions for the restricted membership
schemes.</p>

<h3>Using health insurance</h3>

<p>Health insurance is used to pay for private care in hospital or from various
health professionals in hospitals or in their practices. The arrangements vary
from one company to another but most companies have agreements with hospitals
that the company will pay the hospital directly. In general, for outpatient
costs you pay the health professional and then claim from the health insurance
company. You should check with your own company as to exactly what procedures
they use.</p>

<h3>Health Insurance Authority</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hia.ie">Health Insurance Authority</a>
(HIA) is the independent statutory regulator for the private health insurance
market in Ireland. It monitors the operation of health insurance business in
Ireland and advises the Minister for Health in this regard, including assessing
the effect of any regulations or new legislation on consumers. The HIA aims to
ensure that consumers are aware of their rights and that policies and publicity
material describe cover in a fair and comparable way. The Authority also
reviews the appropriateness of the procedures used by insurers in their
dealings with consumers.</p>

<p>The Health Insurance Authority has useful publications called <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hia.ie/publication/consumer-rights/">My Rights,
My Choices</a> and <a href="http://www.hia.ie/publication/selecting-a-product/">Selecting a Private
Health Insurance Product</a>. You can read them online or <a href="http://www.hia.ie/booklet-request-form">request a hard copy</a>.</p>

<p>You can also compare the benefits and prices of different health insurance
products using their <a href="http://www.hia.ie/ci/health-insurance-comparison">product comparison
tool</a>. </p>

<h3>Risk equalisation</h3>

<p>One of the Health Insurance Authority's functions relates to the operation
of a <a href="http://www.hia.ie/regulation/risk-equalisation/">Risk
Equalisation Scheme</a>. Risk equalisation is a process that aims to equitably
neutralise differences in insurers' costs that arise due to variations in the
age profile of their members. This process is relevant to the customer in so
far as it may affect matters such as the operation of community rating or
competition between insurers. The HIA administers a Risk Equalisation Fund
which pays health credits to the insurance company for people over 60 to help
to meet their higher claims costs. The health credits vary by age, gender and
by level of cover. These credits are funded by a community rating health
insurance levy paid by health insurers.</p>

<h3>Tax relief</h3>

<p>The <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/taxation_and_medical_expenses.html">Health
Insurance Tax Credit</a> reduces the amount of the health insurance premium
that you pay.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>All private health insurance providers must be registered with the Health
Insurance Authority. Typically, insurers must also satisfy various prudential
requirements, which are appropriate to the <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie">Central Bank of Ireland</a> - these are
requirements that apply generally to all insurance and financial services
companies and relate to matters like their financial operation and their
investment policies.</p>

<h3>Minimum level of benefits</h3>

<p>At present, companies that are offering cover for in-patient hospital
services must offer a minimum level of benefits. They must provide a minimum
level of cover in respect of: </p>
<ul><li>Day care/in-patient treatment </li>
  <li>Hospital out-patient treatment </li>
  <li>Maternity benefits </li>
  <li>Convalescence </li>
  <li>Psychiatric treatment and substance abuse </li>
</ul><p>The minimum accommodation level is semi-private in a public hospital.</p>

<h3>Other insurance contracts</h3>

<p>Companies are allowed to offer contracts limited to certain health services,
e.g., dental and optical services, without being subject to the general
requirements about community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover. They
may also offer contracts in relation to GP and out-patient services without
having to meet minimum benefit requirements. </p>

<h3>Access</h3>

<p>There are three general principles that apply to health insurance:</p>
<ul><li>Open enrolment </li>
  <li>Lifetime cover </li>
  <li>Community rating </li>
</ul><h3>Open enrolment</h3>

<p>At present, health insurance companies must accept anyone who wishes to
join, subject to any applicable waiting periods before cover takes effect,
regardless of age, sex or health status - this is known as "open enrolment".
Restricted membership schemes must accept everyone who is qualified to join.
</p>

<h3>Lifetime cover</h3>

<p>Once you join and continue to pay your premiums, the insurance company
cannot refuse to provide you with cover - this is called "lifetime cover". </p>

<p>An individual or family, having already served both the requisite waiting
periods relevant to their age when first taking out private health insurance
and any waiting period for a pre-existing condition may switch from one insurer
to another, and if such an occurance takes place within 13 weeks, those waiting
periods will not have to be served again. Therefore, persons can normally move
from one insurer to another without loss of cover.</p>

<h3>Community rating</h3>

<p>"Community rating" means that the insurance company must charge the same
rate for a given level of service, regardless of age, sex or health status. So
all adults pay the same amount for the same benefits. Unlike motor insurance or
life insurance, matters such as age, sex, sexual orientation, health or past
record of claims do not affect the price charged for insurance. </p>

<p>Charges may be lower than the normal adult rate for: people aged under 25;
retired people who have a special arrangement within their company's health
insurance scheme and people in group health insurance schemes. Charges for
children must be reduced by at least 50%.</p>

<h3>Lifetime community rating</h3>

<p>Higher charges apply to people who are 35 years of age or older when they
first take out health insurance. There is a 2% loading for each year over 34
years of age. So, for example, if you are 35 the cost is 2% higher than for a
person aged 34 but if you are 44 then the cost is 20% higher.</p>

<p>If you previously had health insurance, you can be given credit for the time
you were insured, reducing the number of years to which the loading applies.</p>

<p>If you have a break in cover of less than 13 weeks this will not affect your
loading.</p>

<p>If you stopped your insurance cover for periods of unemployment since 1
January 2008, up to three years of credits can be provided.</p>

<p>If you live outside Ireland and move to Ireland, a loading will not apply if
you get health insurance within nine months and continue to be insured.</p>

<p>The Department of Health has published a list of <a href="http://health.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/FAQ.pdf">frequently asked
questions about lifetime community rating</a>. The regulations are set out in
<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2014/en.si.2014.0312.pdf">Statutory
Instrument 312 of 2014 (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Waiting periods</h3>

<p>The health insurance company may not refuse to accept you on the basis of
your health status but it may restrict the cover it gives you in certain
circumstances. </p>

<p>When you take out health insurance for the first time, you may have to serve
waiting periods before you are fully covered, but accident and injury will be
covered immediately.</p>

<p>If you are changing to a health insurance plan with improved benefits there
may be a waiting period before the higher benefits apply.</p>

<p>The HIA lists the <a href="https://www.hia.ie/consumer-information/waiting-periods/new-customer-waiting-periods">current
waiting periods that are applied by insurers</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Initial waiting periods</strong></p>

<p>Insurers are entitled to apply an initial waiting period before private
health insurance cover becomes effective.</p>

<p>The maximum initial waiting period is 26 weeks. </p>

<p>For maternity-related claims the waiting period is 52 weeks. </p>

<p><strong>Pre-existing conditions</strong></p>

<p>The health insurance company may refuse to cover you in respect of
pre-existing conditions for longer periods after you join. So, for example, if
you are have diabetes, the insurance company may refuse to provide you with any
cover for diabetes for a specified period but must cover you for any other
illnesses once the initial waiting period has expired.</p>

<p>For policies taken out since 1 May 2015, the maximum waiting period for
pre-existing conditions is 5 years.</p>

<p>Any waiting period for a pre-existing condition may switch from one Irish
insurer to another. If the switch takes place within 13 weeks, the completed
waiting periods will not have to be served again. Therefore, you can normally
move from one Irish insurer to another without loss of cover.</p>

<p>For contracts taken out before 1 May 2015, longer waiting periods for
pre-existing conditions could be applied to people aged 55–59 (maximum 7
years) or aged over 60 (a maximum of 10 years). </p>

<p><strong>Upgrade waiting periods</strong> </p>

<p>If you are switching health insurance plans, a maximum waiting period may be
applied to any higher benefit on the new plan. </p>

<p>For contracts taken out since 1 May 2015, the maximum waiting period is 2
years (for contracts before that date a longer waiting period of 5 years could
be applied to people aged over 65). For maternity benefits, the maximum waiting

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You must apply directly to the health insurance company that you wish to
join. Each company must abide by the general rules described but, after that,
they are free to make their own rules. The level of cover available and the
rates charged vary from one company to another. </p>

<p>Health insurance policies are usually 12 month contracts. If you want to
switch insurer or insurance plan, you may do so at your next renewal date.
Insurers may have <a href="http://www.hia.ie/consumer-information/switching/">restrictions on
switching plan during the 12 month term</a>.</p>

<p>It is a general principle in insurance that you must give all relevant
information to the insurance company. If you do not, then the entire contract
may be void.</p>

<p>If you are experiencing problems with getting cover, you should contact the
Department of Health or the Health Insurance Authority. </p>

<p>Occupational therapy services are designed to help people who have a
disability (physical, psychological or social) to achieve the maximum degree of
independence in ordinary living.</p>

<p>Many occupational therapists work in Health Service Executive (HSE) <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO">Local Health Offices</a> or
Primary Care Teams. </p>

<p>In theory, everyone who needs the service of an occupational therapist is
eligible. In practice, there may be long waiting lists and applications are
prioritised according to need. Prescribed aids and appliances are available
free of charge to <a shape="rect" href="../entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical card
holders</a>, people on the <a href="../health_related_benefits_and_entitlements/long_term_illness_scheme.html">Long
Term Illness Scheme</a> and people who have a <a shape="rect" href="../blood_and_organ_donation/hepatitis_c_and_health_amendment_act_cards.html">Health
Amendment Act Card</a>.</p>

<p>The Association of Occupational Therapists of Ireland <a href="https://aoti.ie/page.aspx?contentid=57">has a database of occupational
therapists in private practice</a>. </p>

<p><a href="registration_of_health_and_social_care_professionals.html">CORU</a>,
the regulator for health and social care professionals, has a statutory
register of occupational therapists in both the public and private sector.</p>

<h3>Assessment</h3>

<p>Usually, the occupational therapist carries out an assessment of your
ability to function in relation to the normal requirements of living –
dressing, eating, bathing, etc. Your home arrangements are also assessed and a
decision is made as to what assistance you need by way of aids and appliances.
For example, a wheelchair, chair lift or downstairs bathroom.</p>

<p>The occupational therapist may then arrange for the provision of some
appropriate aids and appliances by the HSE if you are eligible or may certify
that you are eligible for the <a href="../../housing/housing_grants_and_schemes/housing_adaptation_grant_for_people_with_disability.html">housing
adaptation grant for people with a disability</a>. They may also provide advice
and assistance to you and your family or carers in relation to changes or
adaptations that need to be made.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You may apply directly to your <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO">Local Health Office</a> for
the services of an occupational therapist, but it is more usual for you to be
referred by a <a shape="rect" href="public_health_nurses.html">public health
nurse</a>, family doctor (GP) or hospital. </p>

<p>To find a private occupational therapist contact the Association of
Occupational Therapists of Ireland or consult the database on its website.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>This document describes the complaints system for public health services
provided by, or on behalf of, the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p>

<p><strong>Private health services</strong></p>

<p>For information about making a complaint about a private health service
visit <a href="http://www.healthcomplaints.ie/">healthcomplaints.ie</a> which
provides information on making complaints about private and public health
services.</p>

<p><strong>Public health services</strong></p>

<p>There is a statutory complaints system for anyone seeking or receiving
public health or personal social services who wishes to make a complaint about
the HSE. The complaints system also covers service providers with HSE contracts
who provide health or personal social services on behalf of the HSE. The law
governing the complaints system is set out in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0042/sec0009.html#partii-sec9">Part
9 of the Health Act 2004</a>. </p>

<h3>What can you make a complaint about? </h3>

<p>You may make a complaint about any action of the HSE or a service provider
that, in your view, doesn’t seem to be fair or reliable administrative
practice and that adversely affects you, or someone on whose behalf you are
making a complaint. </p>

<p>Administrative practice refers to the way decisions are made and how
services operate. Under the complaints system, administrative practice isn’t
considered to be fair or reliable if it is: </p>
<ul><li>Taken without proper authority</li>
  <li>Taken on irrelevant grounds </li>
  <li>The result of negligence or carelessness </li>
  <li>Based on erroneous or incomplete information </li>
  <li>Improperly discriminatory </li>
  <li>Based on undesirable administrative practice</li>
  <li>In any other respect, against fair or sound administration</li>
</ul><h3>Who can make a complaint?</h3>

<p>If you are unable to make a complaint on your own behalf due to your age,
illness or disability, someone else can make a complaint on your behalf. These
people include:</p>
<ul><li>A close relative or carer.</li>
  <li>Anyone appointed by law or the courts to take care of your affairs. (This
    would seem to include a Committee of a <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/wards_of_court.html">Ward of Court</a> or
    someone appointed under an <a shape="rect" href="/en/death/before_a_death/power_of_attorney.html">Enduring Power of
    Attorney</a> . It is not however entirely clear as the law which applies to
    Committees and Attorneys gives them specific and not general powers). </li>
  <li>A legal representative. </li>
  <li>Anyone else with your consent.</li>
  <li>Anyone who is appointed, as set out in the Regulations.</li>
</ul><h3>Can a complaint be made on behalf of a deceased person? </h3>

<p>Yes. In such cases the complaint may be made by a close relative or carer. A
close relative includes a parent, guardian, son, daughter, spouse or cohabiting
partner. Remember, the complaint must be made within 12 months of the date of
the action giving rise to the complaint or of the person becoming aware of the
action. A complaints officer may extend the time limit if there are special
circumstances involved. </p>

<h3>Which complaints are not covered? </h3>

<p>You cannot complain about: </p>
<ul><li>A matter that is, or has been the subject of legal proceedings before a
    court or <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/tribunals_and_investigations/tribunals_introduction.html">tribunal</a>
    .</li>
  <li>A matter relating solely to the <em>clinical judgment</em> (medical
    decision) by a person acting on behalf of the HSE or a service
  provider.</li>
  <li>An action taken by the HSE or a service provider solely on the advice of
    someone exercising their clinical judgment.</li>
  <li>A matter relating to the recruitment, appointment or terms and conditions
    of an employee or advisor of the HSE or a service provider.</li>
  <li>A matter relating to the registration of births, marriages and deaths
    that could be the subject of an appeal (<a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0003/sec0060.html#partviii-sec60">Section
    60 of the Civil Registration Act 2004</a>). A matter that could prejudice
    an investigation being undertaken by the Gardaí.</li>
  <li>A matter that has been brought before any other statutory complaints
    procedure. (This doesn’t prevent a complaints officer dealing with a
    complaint that was made to the Ombudsman or the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oco.ie/">Ombudsman for Children</a>.) </li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>How does the HSE complaints procedure operate? </h3>

<p>The complaints officer will be informed of all verbal complaints that could
not be resolved at the first point of contact and will receive a copy of all
written complaints. Depending on the nature of the complaint, the complaints
officer, with the consent of the people involved, may consider if an informal
resolution might be appropriate. As part of the informal resolution the
complaints officer may arrange a meeting between the parties concerned or use
mediation services. If informal resolution is not appropriate or turns out not
to be successful, the complaints officer will start a formal investigation of
the complaint.</p>

<p>Complaints officers deal with the complaint and make a recommendation. You
may then ask for a review of that recommendation and there will be an internal
review. (See ‘How to apply’ for information on how to make a complaint).</p>

<p>Written complaints will be acknowledged within five working days and the
complaint will be investigated within 30 working days. You will get a written
response to your complaint. You will be told of your right to have an internal
review and of your right to go to the Ombudsman.</p>

<p>Service providers may put their own procedures in place by agreement with
the HSE. It is a condition of the agreement between the HSE and service
providers that service providers will comply with the HSE complaints procedure,
or establish its own complaints procedures. It’s also a condition that the
service provider will co-operate with the HSE in any review of a complaints
officer’s recommendation following the investigation of a complaint against
the service provider. </p>

<h3>Are complaints officers required to fully investigate every complaint?</h3>

<p>No. Complaints officers may stop investigating a complaint for various
reasons. For example, if the complaint is trivial or vexatious. Complaints
officers do not have to investigate complaints that don’t come within the
scheme.</p>

<h3>What recommendations can a complaints officer not make?</h3>

<p>A complaints officer cannot make a recommendation which would require the
HSE to make a material change to its approved service plan. (Approved service
plans indicate the type and volume of health and personal social services to be
provided by the HSE, they indicate planned capital spending on services,
etc.)</p>

<p>Complaints officers cannot make recommendations either that would require a
change to be made to the contractual arrangements which the HSE has with a
service provider.</p>

<p>If the CEO of the HSE or the service provider considers that a
recommendation breaches this rule, they may amend the recommendation as
required, or they may reject the recommendation and take other measures to deal
with the complaint. </p>

<h3>Will details of complaints received be reported? <br></h3>

<p>Yes. The HSE is obliged to publish information about the complaints
procedure, as part of its annual report. Service providers must provide the HSE
with details about the number and the nature of complaints dealt with, through
their own complaints procedures. </p>

<h3>Complaints under the Disability Act 2005</h3>

<p>The Disability Act 2005 provides for, among other things, the <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health_services_for_people_with_disabilities/assessment_of_need_for_people_with_disabilites.html">assessment
of need of people with disabilities</a> and the consequent drawing up of
service statements.</p>

<p>There is also a <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/disability/Disability_Assessment/">complaints
and appeals procedure under the Disability Act 2005</a> which you can use if
you are unhappy with your child's assessment or service statement or delivery
of related services.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>There is no fee to make a formal complaint about a public health or personal
social service provided by the HSE. There is no fee to make a formal complaint
to a service provider, who provides services on behalf of the HSE.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you wish to make a complaint about the HSE you should first of all try to
resolve the problem locally. That means, bringing the complaint to the
attention of the person in charge of the service, for example the ward sister
in the case of a hospital complaint, or the supervisor in charge for other
services. Some <a shape="rect" href="/en/consumer_affairs/consumer_protection/consumer_complaints/how_to_make_a_consumer_complaint.html">general
advice on how to make a consumer complaint is available here</a>.</p>

<p>If you are still unhappy, you can make your complaint through the formal
complaints mechanism. There are a number of <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/yourhealthservice/feedback/Complaint/">ways
in which to make a complaint to the HSE</a>, including by mail, phone, email,
online, or through advocacy or accessibility services.</p>

<p>It is advisable to make your formal complaint in writing, giving as much
detail as you can. Written complaints will be acknowledged within five working
days and the complaint will be investigated within 30 days. If the
investigation takes longer than 30 days, the HSE will keep you up updated about
progress on your complaint every 20 working days. </p>

<p>Following the investigation, you will receive a written response to your
complaint and will be advised of your right to have an internal review of the
recommendation of the complaints officer. You will also be told of your right
to complain to the Ombudsman. </p>

<h3>What happens if you exhaust the complaints process? </h3>

<p>If you have exhausted the health service complaints process, you may <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/office_of_the_ombudsman.html">complain
to the Ombudsman</a> or the Ombudsman for Children. Their role is not changed
by this complaints procedure. Actions taken by service providers under
agreements with the HSE will be considered to have been taken by the HSE for
the purposes of the legislation governing each Ombudsman. This in effect,
extends the Ombudsman’s remit to these service providers.</p>

<p>The law doesn’t provide for a mechanism for implementing the
recommendations of a complaints officer or for what is to happen if the
recommendation is not implemented. </p>

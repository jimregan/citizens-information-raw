<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you have a medical card issued by the <a shape="rect" href="../how_health_is_organised_boards.html">Health Service Executive
(HSE)</a> you can receive certain health services free of charge. Normally,
your dependent spouse or partner and your children are also covered for the
same range of health services.</p>

<p>To qualify for a medical card, your weekly income must be below a certain
figure for your family size. Cash income, savings, investments and property
(except for your own home) are taken into account in the means test.</p>

<p><strong>GP visit cards:</strong> If you do not qualify for a medical card on
income grounds, you may qualify for a <a shape="rect" href="gp_visit_cards.html">GP visit card</a>. </p>

<h3>What health services are normally covered?</h3>

<p>If you have a medical card, you are entitled to:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="../gp_services/gp_services_to_medical_card_holders.html">Free GP
    (family doctor) services</a></li>

  <li><a shape="rect" href="../women_s_health/maternity_and_infant_welfare_services.html">Maternity

  <li>Some personal and social care services, for example, <a shape="rect" href="../care_in_your_community/public_health_nurses.html">public health

    your <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">Local Health
    Office</a>)</li>
</ul><h3>Other benefits</h3>

<p>Medical card holders pay the <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">Universal
Social Charge</a> on their income if it is over the exemption limit, but there
is a reduced rate. Medical card holders may also be exempt from paying <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_primary_school/primary_school_transport_scheme.html">school
transport charges</a> and State exam fees in publicly-funded second-level
schools. There may also be <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/the_irish_education_system/measures_to_address_educational_disadvantage.html">financial
help with buying school books in certain schools</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Means test</h3>

<p>Normally, your total income is taken into account in the means test for the
medical card.</p>

<p><strong>There are different guidelines for the means test depending on your
age</strong>:</p>
<ul><li><a href="medical_card_means_test_under_70s.html">Means test rules for
    people <strong>under 70</strong> years of age</a></li>
  <li><a href="medical_card_means_test_over_70s.html">Means test rules for
    people <strong>over 70</strong> years of age </a></li>
</ul><p>The assessment of a couple for medical card purposes is based on the age of
the older person. </p>

<p>If your income is above the limit you may still be able to obtain a medical
card if your circumstances would result in hardship without one. This is
sometimes called a <em>discretionary medical card</em>. See the Assessment
Guidelines in <em>Further information</em> below for details.</p>

<h3>People aged 16–25, including students</h3>

<p>If you are aged 16–25 and dependent on a parent or guardian, you are
eligible for a medical card if your parent or guardian has a medical card.</p>

<p>If you have an income over the <a href="medical_card_means_test_under_70s.html">medical card income limit for
a single person living with family</a> you are considered financially
independent and in this case the usual means test applies.</p>

<p>If you are not living with or dependent on a parent or guardian then you are
living as an independent person regardless of income and your application is
assessed using the <a href="medical_card_means_test_under_70s.html">standard
means test</a>.</p>

<h3>Domiciliary Care Allowance</h3>

<p>If you have a child for whom you are getting <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/domiciliary_care_allowance.html">Domiciliary
Care Allowance</a>, the child is eligible for a medical card, without a means
test, from 1 June 2017.</p>

<p>If the child does not have a medical card or GP visit card, you can <a href="http://www.sspcrs.ie/portal/free-gp-care-dca-web">register the child for
a medical card online</a> or <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/mc/dca/Final%20Version%20DCA%20Form.pdf">download
a registration form (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>If the child already has a medical card or GP visit card, you do not need to
register; they will be automatically registered for a medical card.</p>

<p>The HSE has a list of <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/mc/dca/">Frequently Asked
Questions about this scheme</a>.</p>

<h3>People who are exempt from the means test</h3>
<ul><li>Those with EU entitlement — see 'Further information' below</li>
  <li>Children under 18 years of age who are diagnosed with cancer</li>
  <li>People affected by the drug Thalidomide</li>
  <li>Women who have had a symphysiotomy</li>
</ul><h3>Other categories</h3>

<p>Medical cards are usually granted to <strong>children in foster
care</strong>. </p>

<h3>After your card is issued</h3>

<p>If your circumstances change you must inform the HSE as you may no longer be
eligible. For example, if your income or family circumstances change, you must
inform the Client Registration Unit as soon as possible — see 'How to apply'
below. Your card will be reviewed periodically.</p>

<p><strong>Reviews</strong></p>

<p>The HSE will ask you periodically to confirm your circumstances. A review
form is sent to you, which you must fill in and return to the Client
Registration Unit. If you do not return your review form your application
cannot be re-assessed and your card may not be re-issued.</p>

<p>If you return your review form by the given date but the review process
continues past the expiry date of your card, the card’s validity may be
extended so that you can continue to use it while the review is taking place.
The extension is on a month-by-month basis so it is advisable to contact the
Client Registration Unit to confirm that your card has been extended and
continues to be valid.</p>

<p><strong>Returning to work</strong></p>

<p>If you are getting a social welfare payment for a year or more and <a href="../../employment/starting_work_and_changing_job/training_and_looking_for_work/return_to_work.html">return
to work</a>, you may be able to keep your medical card for up to 3 years.</p>

<p><strong>If you move</strong></p>

<p>You can use your medical card for up to 3 months if you are living
temporarily in a different area. In this case, you can attend any GP in the
area participating in the medical card scheme. If you are going to be away
longer than 3 months, you do not have to re-apply for a new Medical Card. You
should make contact with your new <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">Local Health Office</a> where
you will be advised of the GPs practising in your new area.</p>

<p>If you are changing your GP, you complete a <a href="https://www.sspcrs.ie/portal/medapp/changedoctor.pdf">Change of Doctor
Form (pdf)</a>, giving details of the new doctor. The form is available online
or by phoning Lo-call 1890 252 919.</p>

Lo-call 1890 252 919, contact your Local Health Office, or email <a shape="rect" href="mailto:clientregistration@hse.ie">clientregistration@hse.ie</a>.</p>

<p>You can <strong>apply online</strong> for a medical card on <a shape="rect" href="http://www.medicalcard.ie">medicalcard.ie</a>. This is the quickest
method of obtaining the card. The completed form will be returned to you.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can <strong>download</strong> a medical card application
form:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/mc/forms/medicalcardformmay15.pdf">MC1
    Medical Card and GP Visit Card Application Form (pdf)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/mc/forms/over70sform.pdf">MC1(a)
    Medical Card and GP Visit Card Application Form - People Aged 70 Years or
    Older (pdf)</a> if you are aged over 70</li>
</ul><p>You can also get the application form and a list of participating GPs from
your <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/">local
health centre</a> or <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">Local
Health Office</a> for your area. </p>

<p>You bring the form to the GP you have chosen from the list of participating
doctors. Usually, the GP you select must have his/her practice within 7 miles
of where you live. If the GP agrees to accept you as a patient for <a href="../gp_services/gp_services_to_medical_card_holders.html">medical card
GP services</a>, he/she signs the form. </p>

<p>You return the form to the Client Registration Unit, along with the
documentary evidence specified on the form. </p>

<p>You can track the progress of your medical card application at <a shape="rect" href="http://www.medicalcard.ie">medicalcard.ie</a>. </p>

<p>The HSE has FAQs on <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/mc/about/">medical
cards</a> and <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/mc/over70s/">medical
cards/GP Visit Cards for people aged 70 and over.</a></p>

<p><strong>Children with Domiciliary Care Allowance</strong></p>

<p>For a child that does not have a medical card or GP visit card, you can <a href="http://www.sspcrs.ie/portal/free-gp-care-dca-web">register the child for
a medical card online</a> or <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/mc/dca/Final%20Version%20DCA%20Form.pdf">download
a registration form (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>If the child already has a medical card or GP visit card, you do not need to
register; they will be automatically registered for a medical card.</p>

<p><strong>Children diagnosed with cancer</strong></p>

<p>Children under the age of 18 who have been diagnosed with cancer within the
last 5 years are eligible for a medical card without a means test. The
application form does not require information about income but does require a
medical report. You can download the <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/mc/forms/Children%20under%2018%20years%20diagnosed%20with%20cancer.pdf">Medical
Card Application Form for Children under 18 years, Form MC1(b)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Appeals</strong></p>

<p>If you have been refused a medical card and are not satisfied with the
decision, you may have it reviewed. Your circumstances may have changed or you
may have left out some relevant information from the original application. If
you are not satisfied with the review you may <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/yourhealthservice/Appeals/Appeals_Process/">make
an appeal to the Appeals Office for your HSE Area</a>. The contact details will
also be contained in your letter of refusal. The Appeals Office will conduct a
reassessment of your application. This will be conducted by HSE staff who were
not involved in deciding on your original application. </p>

<h3>Assessment guidelines</h3>

<p>The HSE has published assessment guidelines for medical card
applications:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/mc/forms/medicalcardguidelines2015.pdf">Medical
    Card/GP Visit Card National Assessment Guidelines (pdf)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/mc/over70s/Over70Guidelines.pdf">Medical
    Card/GP Visit Card National Assessment Guidelines for people aged 70 years
    and over (pdf)</a></li>
</ul><h3>Entitlement under EU Regulations</h3>

<p>If you are getting a social security pension from another EU/EEA country or
Switzerland, or if you are working and paying social insurance in one of these
countries, you may qualify for a medical card under EU rules if you are
ordinarily resident in Ireland. </p>

<p>You must not be subject to Irish social security legislation. This means
that you must not be in receipt of a contributory Irish social welfare payment
or be working in Ireland and be liable to pay PRSI. </p>

<p>If you are living in Ireland and you are the dependant of a pensioner
entitled under EU Regulations, or are the dependant of a person who is working
in another country covered by the Regulations, you may be eligible for a
medical card. You must not be subject to Irish social security legislation (in
the case of child dependants this rule applies to the spouse or person looking
after them). </p>

<p>Posted workers and their dependants may also qualify for the medical card.
These are workers who are employed in another country covered by the
regulations but are sent by their employers to work in Ireland for a limited
time. </p>

<p>See the <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/mc/forms/medicalcardguidelines2015.pdf">assessment
guidelines (pdf)</a> for more information about entitlement under EU
Regulations.</p>

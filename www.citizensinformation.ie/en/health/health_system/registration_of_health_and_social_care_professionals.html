<p>CORU is the regulator for health and social care professionals. Its role is
to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct,
education, training and competence through statutory registration of health and
social care professionals. It was set up under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0027/index.html">Health
and Social Care Professionals Act 2005</a>, (as amended).</p>

<p>The system of statutory registration will apply to the following 12 health
and social care professions, regardless of whether they work in the public or
private sector or are self-employed:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="chiropody_services.html">Chiropodists/podiatrists</a></li>
  <li>Clinical biochemists</li>
  <li>Dietitians</li>
  <li>Medical scientists</li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="occupational_therapy_services.html">Occupational
    therapists</a></li>
  <li>Orthoptists</li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="physiotherapy_services.html">Physiotherapists</a></li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../mental_health/mental_health_services.html">Psychologists</a></li>
  <li>Radiographers</li>
  <li>Social care workers</li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="social_work_services.html">Social workers</a></li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="speech_and_language_therapy_services.html">Speech
    and language therapists</a></li>
</ul><p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://system.coru.ie/index.php/SearchMember/Find">registers
for dietitians, occupational therapists, optometrists/dispensing opticians,
physiotherapists, radiographers/radiation therapists, social workers, and
speech and language therapists</a> are open. Once a register opens, there is a
<a href="http://www.coru.ie/en/registration/two_year_transitional_period_by_profession">two-year
transitional period</a> after which only professionals on the Register are
legally allowed to use the professional title.</p>

<h3>Complaints – Fitness to Practise</h3>

<p>CORU handles complaints about the fitness to practice of registered health
and social care professionals. This may include, for example, complaints of
professional misconduct or poor professional performance.</p>

<p>CORU can only look into events that have occurred since 31 December 2014,
when it started accepting complaints.</p>

<p>To make a complaint about a registered practitioner, complete <a href="http://www.coru.ie/uploads/documents/FTP_Complaint_Form_version_1_Final.docx">CORU’s
Fitness to Practise complaint form</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.coru.ie/en/public/fitness_to_practise_complaints">Further
information on the Fitness to Practise complaints process</a> is available on
the CORU website and there is a <a href="http://www.coru.ie/uploads/documents/FTP1_-_Guide_to_Fitness_to_Practise_Final.pdf">CORU

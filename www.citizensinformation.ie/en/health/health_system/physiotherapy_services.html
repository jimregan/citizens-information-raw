<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>Physiotherapy services delivered through the public health service are
generally provided in <a href="../hospital_services/hospital_services_introduction.html">hospitals</a>,
either on an in-patient or out-patient basis. Physiotherapists are specialised
members of the healthcare profession who use mainly physical means such as
exercise, manipulation, massage and electrical methods of therapy. This therapy
is used to treat pain, injury and disability as a result of conditions and
illnesses that affect people of all ages and backgrounds. </p>

<p>A limited community physiotherapy service may also be provided by the <a href="../../health_system/health_boards.html">Health Service Executive</a>
(HSE). Where available from the HSE, physiotherapy services are free of charge
to <a shape="rect" href="../entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical card
holders</a> and people who have a <a href="../blood_and_organ_donation/hepatitis_c_and_health_amendment_act_cards.html">Health
Amendment Act Card</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>
The Health Service Executive <span>is not obliged</span> to provide
physiotherapy services in the community but it does in some cases. Usually, a
community service is provided in <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/">health centres</a>
or clinics.</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>In general, if you wish to access physiotherapy services as a public
patient, you need a referral from your family doctor (GP), <a shape="rect" href="public_health_nurses.html">public health nurse</a> or hospital. You can
also refer yourself to a community physiotherapist. </p>

<p>You will have to pay for physiotherapy services if you attend a
physiotherapist in a private capacity. However, you may be able to claim <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/taxation_and_medical_expenses.html">tax
relief for medical expenses</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/staff/PCRS/About_PCRS/">Primary Care
Reimbursement Service</a> administers payments to doctors, pharmacists,
dentists and opticians who provide services under the Primary Care
Reimbursement Service (PCRS) scheme. All aspects of the management and
operation of the PCRS are operated through the Health Service Executive
(HSE).</p>

<p>This scheme was previously called the General Medical Services Payments
Board, usually referred to as the GMS. </p>

<p>The PCRS scheme includes <a shape="rect" href="../entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical card
services</a> provided by doctors and pharmacists, <a shape="rect" href="../entitlement_to_health_services/prescribed_drugs_and_medicines.html">prescribed
drugs and medicines</a> services provided by community pharmacists and <a shape="rect" href="../dental_aural_and_optical_services/dental_services.html">dental
services</a> and <a href="../dental_aural_and_optical_services/optometric_and_ophthalmic_services.html">opthalmic
services</a> provided to medical card holders. Doctors, pharmacists, dentists
and opticians have contracts with the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide
these services and the PCRS makes the payments on behalf of the HSE. The level
of payments and other conditions of service are negotiated by the Department of
Health and the relevant professional bodies. </p>

<h3>What is the PCRS responsible for?</h3>

<p>The PCRS is responsible for: </p>
<ul><li>Calculating payments to be made for the services provided </li>
  <li>Making payments for services provided</li>
  <li>Verifying the accuracy and reasonableness of claims made by services </li>
  <li>Compiling statistics and other information in relation to services. </li>
</ul><p>The PCRS issues an Annual Report that shows the number of people covered by
medical cards, the costs of the services and related information. </p>

<p>The PCRS has a Complaints Tribunal that investigates complaints by the
Health Service Executive (HSE) against individual doctors, pharmacists or
dentists and complaints and appeals by the health professionals against HSE
decisions affecting them.</p>

<p>If you are <a shape="rect" href="entitlement_to_public_health_services.html">ordinarily resident</a>, you
are entitled to either free or subsidised approved prescribed drugs and
medicines and certain medical and surgical aids and appliances.</p>

<h3>Medical card</h3>

<p>Prescribed drugs and medicines are covered by the <a href="../medical_cards_and_gp_visit_cards/medical_card.html">medical
card</a>. Some <a href="prescription_charges_for_medical_card_holders.html">prescription
charges</a> apply to most medical card holders.</p>

<h3>Other schemes</h3>

<p>Under the <a href="long_term_illness_scheme.html">Long Term Illness
Scheme</a>, people suffering from certain conditions can get free drugs,
medicines and medical and surgical appliances for the treatment of that
condition. </p>

<p>The <a href="../blood_and_organ_donation/hepatitis_c_and_health_amendment_act_cards.html">Health
Amendment Act Card</a> provides drugs and medicines for people who have
contracted Hepatitis C directly or indirectly through the administration of
blood products or transfusions.</p>

<h3>Drugs Payment Scheme</h3>

<p>If you are not covered by the medical card or any of the schemes listed
above, you can register for the <a shape="rect" href="drugs_payment_scheme.html">Drugs Payment Scheme</a> which limits the
monthly cost of prescription medicines. </p>

<h3>Tax relief</h3>

<p>Prescribed drugs and medicines are eligible for <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/taxation_and_medical_expenses.html">tax
relief on medical expenses</a>.</p>

<h3>Chemists/pharmacists</h3>

<p>In general, approved prescribed drugs and medicines are provided by the
retail pharmacy (chemist's shop). Virtually all pharmacies have agreements with
the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide services under the Primary Care
Reimbursement Services scheme. </p>

<h3>Other providers</h3>

<p>GPs may provide drugs and medicines directly to patients if the GP has only
one practice centre and it is three miles or more from the nearest retail
pharmacist. Doctors who dispense drugs and medicines under these arrangements
are sometimes called <em>dispensing doctors</em>. </p>

<p>Hospitals and other specialist institutions may also provide drugs,
medicines and aids and appliances directly.</p>

<p>The rules about when drugs and medicines are free or subsidised are the same
regardless of who provides them.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Approved drugs and medicines</h3>

<p>There is a system in place for the approval and control of drugs. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hpra.ie/">Health Products Regulatory
Authority</a> (HPRA) is the authority with responsibility for licensing
medicines and testing them for safety, quality and efficacy. Drugs must be
approved by the HPRA before they can be sold at all. HPRA approval does not
necessarily mean that the drugs and medicines will be approved for the free and
subsidised schemes. There are other factors involved in the approval process,
including costs.</p>

<h3>Free or subsidised schemes</h3>

<p>The HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service provides a <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/staff/PCRS/items/">list of medicines or aids
provided under the medical card or Drugs Payment Scheme</a>. These products are
approved for the schemes by the HSE. </p>

<p>Medical card holders who are prescribed items that are not on this list can
apply to have them covered under a discretionary hardship scheme. If you have a
medical card and an item on your prescription is not covered by it, your
pharmacist can apply on your behalf to the Local Health Office to have the item
covered by the hardship scheme. If the hardship scheme does not cover the
medicine and you have to pay for it, you may want to check with your doctor to
see if there is an alternative. You can get more information about the scheme
from your pharmacist.</p>

<p>Certain items that can be bought over the counter are excluded from the free
or subsidised schemes. Examples of such products are vitamin supplements,
products for the treatment of baldness, and some painkillers, such as Panadol,
Disprin, Solpadeine and Nurofen.</p>

<h3>Generic drugs and reference pricing </h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/act/pub/0014/index.html">Health
(Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013</a> allows pharmacists to
substitute different versions of some prescribed medicines â€“ often less
expensive generic versions of brand name medicines. The medicines must be
included in a <a href="http://www.hpra.ie/homepage/medicines/special-topics/generic-and-interchangeable-medicines/list-of-interchangeable-medicines">list
of interchangeable drugs published by the HPRA</a>. The HPRA has published an
<a href="http://www.hpra.ie/docs/default-source/publications-forms/information-leaflets/generic-medicines_web.pdf?sfvrsn=4">information
leaflet about generic medicines (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>The HSE sets one price that it will pay for each group of interchangeable
medicines. This is known as the reference price. The phased introduction of <a href="http://www.hse.ie/referenceprice/">reference pricing</a> began from 1
November 2013.</p>

<p>If you have a <a href="medical_card.html">medical card</a>, the HSE will
pay the reference price for any interchangeable medicine. If you choose to buy
a more expensive version of the medicine, you must pay the difference between
the reference price and the retail price.</p>

<p>If you are on the <a href="drugs_payment_scheme.html">Drugs Payment
Scheme</a> the HSE will use the reference price to calculate your monthly drugs
costs. If you choose a more expensive version of a medicine that is covered you
must pay the extra cost.</p>

<p>If you need a particular brand of medicine for medical reasons your doctor
can write 'Do not Substitute' on the prescription and you will not have to pay
extra if it costs more than the reference price.</p>

<h3>Prescribing by nurses</h3>

<p>Regulations were introduced under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=5306&amp;CatID=87">Irish
Medicines Board Act 2006</a> which allow nurses the authority to prescribe
medicines. Previously, only doctors had authority to prescribe. </p>

<p>Individual nurse prescribers must be employed by a health service provider
and may only prescribe the drugs relevant to the setting in which they are
employed. There are specific restrictions on certain controlled drugs. </p>

<p>There are an extensive number of voluntary, community and support
organisations that provide advice, information, services and support to
patients and families about health issues. </p>

<p>These organisations play an integral role in the provision of advice,
counselling, sharing of experience, information and support to families and the
wider community. Some of the larger voluntary and community and patient support
organisations operate on a national basis, and have extensive networks of local
links. In addition, some of these organisations offer care services on behalf
of your <a shape="rect" href="../how_health_is_organised_boards.html">Health
Service Executive (HSE) Area</a> within your community. </p>

<p>Hearing that you, a member of your family or someone you know has been
diagnosed with an illness or a rare condition or will go on to develop a
progressive disorder can be devastating news. Often, you may not know where to
turn or where begin to seek information or assistance. You may have lots of
questions but are nervous about what to ask. You may be facing choices and
decisions about treatments and are not sure if the decision you make will be
the best one. It is important for you, therefore, to know that you are not
alone and there is very likely a national or local voluntary or community
organisation that can help answer these questions, share its own experiences
and talk through with you the various options you face and decisions you and
your family will need to make. </p>

<p>The involvement and participation of the voluntary and community sector in
providing advice, information and support at local and national level can be
extremely helpful for patients and families. These organisations can help
provide information about local services, put families in touch with other
families, provide a voice to raise awareness, lobby and campaign for change.

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.cafamily.org.uk/">CAF (Contact a
Family) Directory</a> is a national directory of support organisations and
organisations from the UK. Some of these organisations have branches in
Ireland. The online version of the CAF Directory also contains a database that
includes information on a substantial number of specific conditions and rare
disorders. </p>

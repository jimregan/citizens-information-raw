<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Chiropodists/podiatrists assess, diagnose and treat diseases and
abnormalities of the foot and lower limb. The term 'podiatrist' is now
replacing the term 'chiropodist'. Podiatry can significantly improve peoplesâ€™
quality of life by alleviating painful symptoms, and promoting and maintaining
mobility.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../health_system/health_boards.html">Health Service
Executive</a> (HSE) is <span>not legally obliged to provide chiropody/podiatry
services</span> but where they do, services may be provided by the Local Health
Office or by voluntary organisations on behalf of the HSE. Where the service is
available, it is free to <a shape="rect" href="../entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical card</a>
holders and people with <a shape="rect" href="../blood_and_organ_donation/hepatitis_c_and_health_amendment_act_cards.html">Hepatitis
C</a> who contracted the disease through the use of Human Immunoglobulin-Anti-D
or from the receipt within Ireland of any blood product or a blood transfusion
and who have a <a href="../blood_and_organ_donation/hepatitis_c_and_health_amendment_act_cards.html">Health
Amendment Act Card</a>.</p>

<h3>Tax relief and chiropody services</h3>

<p>Non-medical card holders may be able to claim tax relief on chiropody
services if you are required to attend as part of medical treatment. (That is,
you have a significant disability or a serious illness, etc. and your doctor
directs you attend chiropody services). You may also be able to claim tax
relief on any doctors visits and prescription drugs associated with this care.
</p>

<p>See our information on <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/taxation_and_medical_expenses.html">tax
relief for medical expenses</a> for further details. </p>

<h3>Registration of chiropodists/podiatrists</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.coru.ie/">Coru, the Health and Social Care
Professionals Council</a> is the organisation that will register and regulate
chiropodists/podiatrists. Coru is currently putting in place the foundation for
the establishment of the registers and the professional standards for groups
covered by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.coru.ie/uploads/HSCP%20Act%202005.pdf">Health and Social Care
Professionals Act 2005</a>.</p>

<p>Read more about <a shape="rect" href="registration_of_health_and_social_care_professionals.html">registration
of social care professionals here</a>. </p>

<p>There are currently 3 separate professional bodies representing
chiropodists/podiatrists: </p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.podiatryireland.com">The Society of
    Chiropodists and Podiatrists of Ireland</a> </li>
  <li><a href="http://chiropodypodiatryireland.ie/">Irish
    Chiropodists/Podiatrists Organisation Ltd </a></li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.iocp.org.uk/">Institute of Chiropodists
    and Podiatrists</a> </li>
</ul><p>You can contact them if you want more information about chiropody or wish to
check whether your practitioner is a registered member.</p>

<p>Normally you are referred for chiropody services by your GP or <a shape="rect" href="public_health_nurses.html">public health nurse</a>. You may

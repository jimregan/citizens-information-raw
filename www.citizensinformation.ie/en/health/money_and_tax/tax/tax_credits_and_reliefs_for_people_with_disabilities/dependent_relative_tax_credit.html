<p>If you are caring for a dependent relative you may qualify for the Dependent
Relative Tax Credit. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You can claim Dependent Relative Tax Credit if you maintain at your own
expense:</p>
<ul><li>A relative, including a relative of your spouse or civil partner, who is
    unable to maintain himself or herself as a result of old age or ill-health
  </li>
  <li>A widowed parent or surviving civil partner parent of either yourself or
    your spouse or civil partner, irrespective of the state of his/her health
  </li>
  <li>A son or daughter of either yourself or your spouse or civil partner who
    lives with you and on whose services you must depend as a result of old age
    or ill health. </li>
</ul><h3>Health expenses and your dependent relative</h3>

<p>Before 2007 the main value of the Dependent Relative Tax Credit lay in the
fact that you had to claim this credit to claim <a shape="rect" href="../income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/taxation_and_medical_expenses.html">medical
expenses</a> for that relative. This is no longer the case.</p>

<p>If you pay qualifying health expenses on behalf of another person (whether
they are dependant on you or not) you may be entitled to claim tax relief on
the amount paid. You can claim relief on expenses like doctors' bills,
maintenance or treatment in hospital, prescribed drugs and medicines. If the
person is living in a nursing home and you contribute to the nursing home fees,
you may also be entitled to claim some of the expenses involved. The only
requirement is that the hospital, nursing home or other similar institution
must provide 24-hour nursing care on site.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The value of the Dependent Relative Tax Credit depends on:</p>
<ul><li>The cost of maintaining your dependent relative - the tax credit is the
    cost of maintenance up to €70 in 2017. </li>
  <li>If the income of your dependent relative exceeds €14,504 in 2017, no
    tax credit is due (the income limit was €14,060 in 2016, €13,904 in
    2015 and €13,837 in 2014 and 2013). This figure is based on the maximum
    of the State Pension (Contributory) for people over 80 plus the Living
    Alone Allowance plus the Island Allowance plus €280. All of your
    dependent relative's income (for example, social welfare payments, pensions
    and deposit interest) is taken into account for income limit purposes.</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you are a PAYE taxpayer and are claiming for a dependent relative, the
easiest way to claim the Dependent Relative Tax Credit is to use PAYE Anytime
which is available through <a href="https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html">Revenue's myAccount
service</a>. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you can claim the credit by completing the relevant claim
form, either <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/forms/formdr1.pdf">DR1
(pdf)</a> for a relative or parent or <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/forms/formdr2.pdf">DR2 (pdf)</a> for a
son or daughter or a child. The completed form should be sent to your Revenue
office. It will take longer to update your tax credits and issue a Tax Credit
Certificate if you submit a paper claim.</p>

<p>If you pay tax under the self-assessment system, you can claim the tax
credit by completing the 'Dependent Relative' section on your <a href="../income_tax/how_to_comply_with_your_tax_obligations.html">annual tax
return</a>. </p>

<p>You can get more information on how to claim the credit in Revenue's
leaflet, <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it46.html">IT46:
Dependent Relative Tax Credit</a>. </p>

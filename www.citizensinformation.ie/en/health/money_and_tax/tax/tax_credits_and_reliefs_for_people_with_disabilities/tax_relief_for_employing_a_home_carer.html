<p>You can claim tax relief on the cost of employing a carer either if you
employ one for yourself, or for another family member. </p>

<p>You can employ the carer directly or you can use an agency that employs
carers. If you employ the carer yourself, you should register as an employer
and you will be responsible for your employee's tax and social insurance (<a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/starting_work_and_changing_job/starting_work/tax_and_starting_work.html">PAYE</a>,
Universal Social Charge and <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/employer_s_duty_to_pay_social_insurance_prsi.html">PRSI</a>).
You will also have other duties and obligations as an employer, for example
regarding <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/hours_of_work/working_week.html">hours
of work</a>, <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/contracts_of_employment/contract_of_employment.html">contracts
of employment</a>, <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/pay_slip.html">payslips</a>,

and the <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/pay_inc_min_wage.html">minimum
wage</a>.<br><br>
If you pay an agency to provide the carer, the agency will employ the carer and
be responsible for their tax and social insurance etc. You can still claim tax
relief on the cost of paying the agency to provide a carer.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you employ a carer for <strong>yourself</strong> or on behalf of a
<strong>family member</strong>, you can claim the tax relief on the cost of
that care. A <em>family member</em> is a spouse, civil partner, child or a
relative, including a relation by marriage or civil partnership.</p>

<p>You must be totally incapacitated for the complete tax year (January to
December) in which you are claiming the tax relief but the carer <strong>does
not have to be employed</strong> for the full tax year. The term <em>totally
incapacitated</em> means you are disabled and require a carer.</p>

<p>You cannot claim tax relief for employing a carer if the carer only carries
out housekeeper duties or if a <a shape="rect" href="dependent_relative_tax_credit.html">Dependent Relative Tax Credit</a> or
an <a shape="rect" href="incapacitated_child_tax_credit.html">Incapacitated
Child Tax Credit</a> has already been granted. </p>

<p>You may be asked by the Revenue Commissioners to get a medical certificate
to confirm the nature of your disability but it isn't necessary to send one in
with your application form unless you are getting home nursing for a serious
illness.</p>

<h3>Home nursing</h3>

<p>If you, or a family member has a serious illness and you employ a qualified
nurse, you must provide the Revenue Commissioners with the following:</p>
<ul><li>Name, address and qualifications of each nurse providing care </li>
  <li>Receipts for all payments made to the nurses </li>
  <li>A medical certificate from doctor (either your GP or consultant)</li>
</ul><p><strong>The medical certificate must state the following:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Name and address of the person with the serious illness </li>
  <li>The nature of that illness </li>
  <li>Confirm that constant nursing care by a qualified nurse in the
    patient’s home is required </li>
  <li>Cover the full period of time for which the tax relief is being claimed
    for home nursing. </li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Tax allowances and reliefs reduce the amount of tax that you have to pay.
The amount by which a tax allowance/relief will reduce your tax depends on your
rate of tax. <a shape="rect" href="../income_tax/how_your_tax_is_calculated.html">You can find out more
about how your income tax is calculated</a>.</p>

<p>You can claim tax relief (at your highest rate) on the lower of the
following two amounts: </p>
<ul><li>The actual cost incurred or</li>
  <li>The maximum deduction of €75,000 </li>
</ul><p>The maximum amount of relief for employing a carer is €75,000 in 2017 (It
was €75,000 in 2016 and 2015 and €50,000 in 2014 and previous years). You
<strong>must</strong> claim the relief <strong>each year</strong>. You can get
tax relief on the cost of employing a carer, less any amount recovered from the
<a shape="rect" href="/en/health/how_health_is_organised/health_boards.html">Health Service
Executive (HSE)</a>. If two or more of you pay for the care, the relief is
divided between you in proportion to the amount each paid. <br></p>

your form P60 and that of your spouse or civil partner, if applicable, to your
local Revenue office.</p>

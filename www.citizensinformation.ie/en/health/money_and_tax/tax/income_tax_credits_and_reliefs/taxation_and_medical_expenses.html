<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you pay medical expenses that are not covered by the State or by private
health insurance, you may claim tax relief on some of those expenses. These
expenses include the costs involved in nursing home care. More information is
available about <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/health_services_for_older_people/tax_relief_on_nursing_home_fees_and_for_dependent_relatives.html">tax
relief on nursing home fees and for dependent relatives</a>. </p>

<p>Tax relief is also available for premiums paid for <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/health_insurance/private_health_insurance.html">health
insurance</a> and for long-term care insurance. The insurance company grants
this tax relief at source. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lf1338">Medical expenses</h2>

<p>You can claim tax relief on medical expenses you pay for yourself and on

expenses from any other source. You cannot claim tax relief for sums already
received or due to be received from:</p>
<ul><li>A public or local authority, for example, the HSE (Health Service
    Authority) </li>
  <li>An insurance policy </li>

</ul><p>You cannot claim relief for cosmetic surgery costs, unless you need the
surgery as a result of a congenital abnormality, personal injury or disease.
</p>

<p>The list of treatments and appliances that attract tax relief is added to
from time to time. If you are undergoing a new procedure or availing of a new
appliance, it is worth checking whether you can claim tax relief. For more
information, see the <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/health-and-age/health-expenses/index.aspx">Revenue
website</a>.</p>

<h2>Health Insurance Tax Credit</h2>

<p>If you are a member of an approved private health insurance scheme, you may
get a tax credit. This tax credit is generally granted directly by the
insurance company. Your premium will be reduced by the amount of the tax credit
so you will probably not even notice that you have got a tax credit. This is
known as Tax Relief at Source (TRS). However in some limited situations TRS
does not apply, for example, where an employer pays the medical insurance
premiums on behalf of an employee. This is treated as a Benefit in Kind and
PAYE, PRSI and USC are due on the total amount. This means that the employee
does not benefit from the TRS on the medical insurance premium and can make a
claim directly to Revenue. You can get examples of how tax relief is applied
where medical insurance premiums are paid directly by employers on <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/health-and-age/medical-insurance-premiums/index.aspx">Revenue's
website</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/health-and-age/medical-insurance-premiums/index.aspx">Tax
relief on private health insurance premiums is limited to €1,000 for each
adult and €500 for each child</a>. This applies to policies which are renewed
or entered into on or after <strong>16 October 2013</strong>. A child for the
purposes of this provision includes a student over 18 years and under 23 years
who is in full-time education. The relief is given at the standard rate of 20%.
</p>

<p>Additional age-related tax credits for health insurance starting for people
aged 50 and over and increasing for higher age groups were introduced in 2009.
From 2011 the additional relief started after age 60. In 2012 the age bands
were narrowed. These age-related tax credits were replaced by a new risk
equalisation scheme in 2013. <a href="http://www.hia.ie/regulation/risk-equalisation/">Policies taken out or
renewed after 31 March 2013 come under the new scheme</a>. You do not need to
claim this relief as it is granted directly by the insurance company (Tax
Relief at Source).</p>

<h3>Long-term care insurance</h3>

<p>You can now receive a tax credit for payments to long-term care insurance
schemes. This operates in the same way as the health insurance tax credit. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Travelling abroad for treatment</h3>

<p>You can claim tax relief on the cost of medical treatment obtained outside
the State. You can claim for treatment abroad that is also available in the
State but you cannot claim travelling expenses for this care (see below)</p>

<p>The practitioner (GP, consultant or dentist) who provides your care must be
entitled to practice in the country in which the care is provided. </p>

<p>You can only claim for the cost of maintenance or treatment in a hospital,
nursing home or clinic abroad if the hospital, nursing home or clinic provides
access to 24 hour nursing on-site</p>

<p>If the qualifying health care is only available outside Ireland, you can
also claim reasonable travelling and accommodation expenses. In such cases the
expenses of one person accompanying the patient may also be allowed if the
condition of the patient requires it. If the patient is a child, the expenses
of one parent are usually allowed and, exceptionally, of both parents where it
is clear that both need to be with the child.</p>

<h3>Dental and optical treatment</h3>

<p><strong>You cannot get tax relief for routine ophthalmic and dental
care</strong>. Routine ophthalmic treatment covers sight testing, provision and
maintenance of glasses and contact lenses. You can get tax relief for orthoptic
or similar treatment where prescribed by a doctor. Routine dental treatment
covers extractions, scaling and filling of teeth and provision and repairing of
artificial teeth and dentures.</p>

<p><strong>The following dental treatments <em>do</em> qualify for tax
relief:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Crowns </li>
  <li>Veneers/Rembrant type etched fillings </li>
  <li>Tip replacing </li>
  <li>Gold posts </li>
  <li>Gold inlays </li>
  <li>Endodontics (root canal treatment) </li>
  <li>Periodontal treatment </li>
  <li>Orthodontic treatment </li>

</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You do not need to do anything about tax relief for health insurance or
long-term care insurance because the credits are granted automatically at
source (TRS).</p>

<p>You must apply separately for medical expenses relief. </p>

<p>You can <a shape="rect" href="../income_tax/online_services_for_paye_taxpayers.html">claim tax relief
online</a> using Revenue's <a href="https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html">myAccount service</a>. You
can use <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/forms/med1.pdf">Medical form MED1
(pdf)</a> to claim tax relief on all general medical expenses (including dental
expenses). You can only claim for medical expenses if you have receipts to
prove your claim. </p>

<p>Do <strong>not</strong> send your medical receipts (this includes MED 2)
with your MED 1 form. However, you must keep your medical receipts for six
years because Revenue may investigate your claim. </p>

<p>A <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/forms/med2.pdf">medical form MED2
(pdf)</a> is a receipt to prove your dental expenses. Your dentist will
normally have a supply of MED 2 forms and should complete it for you. </p>

<p>Relief is given by way of repayment at the end of the year. Since 1 January
2005, the <strong>time limit on claims for repayment of tax is four
years</strong>.</p>

<p>Additional information is available on the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it6.html">Revenue website</a> or

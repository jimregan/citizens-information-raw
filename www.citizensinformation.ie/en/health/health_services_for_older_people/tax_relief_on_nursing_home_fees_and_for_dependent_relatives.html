<p>Income tax relief is available on fees paid for nursing homes.</p>

<p>There also are a number of other tax reliefs for carers and people with
disabilities.</p>

<h3>Tax relief on nursing home fees</h3>

<p>Income tax relief is available on fees paid for nursing homes.</p>

<p>You claim tax relief for nursing home fees under the general scheme for tax
relief on medical expenses. Tax relief on nursing home fees applies at the
highest rate of <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/">income
tax</a> that you pay.</p>

<p>If you are paying the charges for a nursing home you can claim the tax
relief, whether you are in the nursing home yourself or you are paying for
another person to be there.</p>

<p>Usually you claim the tax relief at the end of the year but in certain
circumstances tax relief may be available in the current year through the PAYE
system. See Revenueâ€™s information leaflet <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it6.html">IT 6 Medical Expenses
Relief</a>.</p>

<p>For further information, including how to apply, see our document on <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/taxation_and_medical_expenses.html">taxation
and medical expenses</a>.</p>

<h3>Other tax reliefs</h3>

<p>You can claim <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/tax_relief_for_employing_a_home_carer.html">tax
relief on the cost of employing a carer</a> for yourself or for another family
member.</p>

<p>If you are caring for a dependent relative you may qualify for the <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/dependent_relative_tax_credit.html">Dependent
Relative Tax Credit</a>.</p>

<p>A deed of covenant is a legally binding agreement that is written down and
agreed between two people stating that one agrees to pay money to the other
without getting any benefit in return. <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/deeds_of_covenant.html">Tax
relief on a Deed of Covenant</a> is available if it is made to a permanently
incapacitated minor, permanently incapacitated adult, or person over 65 years
of age.</p>

<p>There are also a number of other <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/">tax
reliefs for people with disabilities</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Public health nurses are employed by the <a href="../../health_system/health_boards.html">Health Service Executive</a>
(HSE) to provide a range of health care services in the community. They are
usually based in your local health centre and are assigned to cover specific
geographical areas. They provide services in schools, in health centres, in day
care and other community centres and in people's homes.</p>

<p>Public health nursing teams provide basic nursing care as well as advice and
assistance to their patients. Public health nurses also act as an important
point of access for other community care services. </p>

<p>Public health nurses and community registered general nurses liaise with
family doctors (GPs), practice nurses, hospitals, hospices and other health
service providers to ensure that the needs of the patient are met by the
overall health service.</p>
</div>
Public health nurses visit new-born infants and their mothers in their homes
within 6 weeks of the birth. They are also involved in the arrangement of <a shape="rect" href="../children_s_health/school_health_services.html">school
health services</a>. In some areas, public health nurses keep a register of
older people and visit them as a matter of course. Sometimes, the same service
is also provided for people with disabilities. <div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The main groups of people to whom public health nurses and their teams
provide services are:</p>
<ul><li>Older people who live at home </li>
  <li>People who are chronically or acutely ill at home and people who are
    dying at home </li>
  <li>Children â€“ <a shape="rect" href="../women_s_health/maternity_and_infant_welfare_services.html">infant
    welfare services</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../children_s_health/child_health_services.html">child health
    services</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../children_s_health/school_health_services.html">school health
    services </a></li>
  <li>Expectant mothers and mothers who have recently given birth </li>
  <li>People with disabilities </li>
  <li>People suffering social deprivation </li>
  <li>Travellers </li>
  <li>Those who have contracted <a shape="rect" href="../blood_and_organ_donation/hepatitis_c_and_health_amendment_act_cards.html">Hepatitis
    C</a> directly or indirectly from the use of Human Immunoglobulin-Anti-D or
    from the receipt within Ireland of any blood product or a blood transfusion
    and who hold a Health Amendment Act Card </li>
</ul><p>Local Health Offices may employ Health Care Assistants to assist the public
health nursing service. Care assistants provide personal care rather than
domestic services but there is some overlap between what they do and what home
helps do.</p>

<h3>Palliative care</h3>

<p>Access to public health palliative care nursing is via your GP or medical
consultant. Some voluntary organisations, notably the Irish Cancer Society,
provide nursing services to complement or as an alternative to the public
health nursing service. Palliative nursing is provided in some areas by hospice
nursing teams. You can <a shape="rect" href="../cancer_services/palliative_care.html">read more about palliative care

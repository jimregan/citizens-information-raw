<p>Public health services provided in the community in Ireland are sometimes
referred to as community care services. They are generally provided by the
Health Service Executive (HSE). Community care services may also be provided by
voluntary organisations in conjunction with, or on behalf of, the HSE. There is
a wide variation in the level of services available in different parts of the
country.</p>

<p>In general, <a shape="rect" href="../entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical card</a>
holders are entitled to community care services free of charge. Non-medical
card holders may also be entitled but it is not always possible to actually get
the services.</p>

<h3>What are community care services?</h3>

<p>Community care services can include public health nursing, home help,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, chiropody, day care and respite care.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The rules about which community care services must be provided vary for the
different services. In some cases, the HSE is obliged to provide services
while, in others, the HSE has discretion about whether to make the service
available or not. </p>

<h3>Public health nurses</h3>

<p>The HSE is obliged to provide a free nursing service to medical card
holders. The service is not necessarily confined to medical card holders,
although they get priority as they have a legal entitlement. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="public_health_nurses.html">Public health nurses</a>
supply many basic nursing and medical needs and a number of special services
are provided in some community care areas. These include night nursing, day
nursing, weekend nursing and twilight nursing. The services provided by the
public health nurses vary from area to area and they often act as a point of
access for other community care services. </p>

<p>Some Local Health Offices employ care assistants as a back-up to the public
health nursing service. The role of the care assistant is to provide personal
care rather than domestic services, but there is some overlap between what they
do and what home helps do.</p>

<h3>Home help services</h3>

<p>The Health Service Executive may make arrangements (but is not obliged to do
so) to help maintain at home people who are sick or infirm. They may also make
arrangements for people who would otherwise need institutional care. The usual
way they do this is by providing a home help service. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="home_helps.html">Home helps</a> may be employed either
by the HSE or by voluntary organisations. They usually help with normal
household tasks although they may also help with personal care. If you get a
home help, you may have to make a contribution towards the cost, but this
practice varies greatly from area to area. </p>

<p>Some Local Health Offices also provide a limited home help respite service
for carers.</p>

<h3>Physiotherapy</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="physiotherapy_services.html">Physiotherapy
services</a> are generally provided in the community and are generally free to
medical card holders. Waiting lists operate in many areas. Home services are
only available in a small number of cases.</p>

<h3>Occupational Therapists</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="occupational_therapy_services.html">Occupational
Therapists</a> are employed by most Local Health Offices. Their services are
generally available free to medical card holders. Waiting lists operate in most
community care areas for these services.</p>

<h3>Chiropody services</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="chiropody_services.html">Chiropody services</a> are
available free to medical card holders in most community care areas. </p>

<h3>Technical aids</h3>

<p>The HSE provides medical and surgical aids and appliances, such as
wheelchairs and walking aids, free of charge to medical card holders and people
on the <a href="../health_related_benefits_and_entitlements/long_term_illness_scheme.html">Long
Term Illness Scheme</a>. If you do not have a medical card, you may get such
aids and appliances free if they are part of hospital treatment. In practice,
in other cases, the HSE may provide some help with the costs. </p>

<p>If you have private <a shape="rect" href="../insurance/private_health_insurance.html">health insurance</a>, you may
be covered for some or all of the costs.</p>

<h3>Respite care</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../services_for_people_with_disabilities/respite_care.html">Respite
care</a> or temporary care may be based in the community or in an institution.
In practice, respite care is provided to a varying degree at a number of
locations around the country â€“ in some cases by HSE and in others by
voluntary organisations. </p>

<h3>Day centres</h3>

<p>Day centres include centres that provide day activities such as
recreational, sport and leisure facilities and specialised clinic facilities
that provide a combination of medical and vocational rehabilitation services.
<a shape="rect" href="../services_for_people_with_disabilities/day_centres.html">Day
centres</a> are provided on a variable basis throughout the country, some being
funded by the HSE and others funded by voluntary organisations. Day centres
providing medical care are less widely available and are funded by the HSE.
Access to day centres is by referral and the eligibility conditions vary from
area to area with means tests applying in some cases. </p>

<h3>Meals services</h3>

<p>Meals services are provided by voluntary and statutory bodies. The ways in
which these are provided vary from area to area. Access to meals services is
generally by referral. You may be asked to contribute towards the cost of meals
services. Eligibility conditions vary from area to area.</p>

<h3>Transport</h3>

<p>Transport services are provided by the HSE on a varying basis throughout the
country. These services include access to day hospitals and day centres and
access to outpatient departments and other hospital services. </p>

<h3>Other services</h3>

<p>Other community care services include <a shape="rect" href="social_work_services.html">social workers</a>, <a href="speech_and_language_therapy_services.html">speech therapists</a> and
<a href="dietician_clinical_nutritionists.html">dietitians</a>. </p>

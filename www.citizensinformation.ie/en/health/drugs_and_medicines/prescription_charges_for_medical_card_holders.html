<p>If you have a <a href="../medical_cards_and_gp_visit_cards/medical_card.html">medical
card</a>, there is a charge for <a href="prescribed_drugs_and_medicines.html">prescribed medicines</a> and
other items that you get on prescription from pharmacies. The prescription
charge is €2.50 for each item that is dispensed to you under the medical card
scheme, up to a maximum of €25 per month per person or family.</p>

<p>From 1 March 2017, the prescription charge for medical card holders over the age of 70 will be €2 per item and the monthly maximum will be €20.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Once your pharmacy can identify all of your family members then you should
not pay more than €25 per month. A family is defined as you, your spouse or
partner, any children under 16 years of age and any children between 16 and 21
years of age who are in full time education.</p>

<p>You can set your family up as a family group on <a href="https://www.sspcrs.ie/portal/medapp/">medicalcard.ie</a> and print off a
family certificate to give to your pharmacist. This will show all of the
members of your family so that the pharmacy will not collect charges above the
monthly limit.</p>

<p>If you do not have access to the internet you can get assistance from your
<a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">Local Health Office</a> or
call 1890 252 919 and they will take the details and send you the certificate.
Your local pharmacist may also be able to help you. You will need to have the
medical card number for each member of your family.</p>

<p>The prescription charges are eligible for <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/taxation_and_medical_expenses.html">tax
relief for medical expenses</a>.</p>

<h3>Refunds if you pay more than the monthly limit</h3>

<p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) issues refunds automatically every 6
months, based on the information received from your pharmacy. Refunds are
issued for amounts over €10. Refunds under €10 are carried over to the next
refund payment date. </p>

<p>You can avoid the need for a refund if you and your family visit the same
pharmacy and your pharmacist can identify all of your family members.</p>

<p>If you have a question about refunds you can contact 1890 252 919.</p>

<h3>Medical card holders who do not pay the prescription charge</h3>

<p>Certain people and certain products are not liable for the prescription
charge:</p>
<ul><li>People who qualify for the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health_related_benefits_and_entitlements/long_term_illness_scheme.html">Long
    Term Illness Scheme</a> are entitled to get the drugs and medicines for the
    treatment of that illness free of charge. </li>
  <li>People who have <a shape="rect" href="../blood_and_organ_donation/hepatitis_c_and_health_amendment_act_cards.html">a
    Health Amendment Act Card</a> are entitled to get approved prescribed drugs
    and medicines free of charge. </li>
  <li>Children in the care of the HSE who have their own medical card. This
    includes children in residential care, foster care, foster care with
    relatives and other care placements.</li>
  <li>Asylum seekers living in direct provision accommodation.</li>
  <li>There is no charge for methadone supplied to patients participating in
    the Methadone Treatment Scheme. </li>
  <li>High Tech products and medicines, usually only prescribed in hospitals,
    for example anti-rejection drugs for transplant patients or medicines used
    in conjunction with chemotherapy. As the supply of High Tech Medicines
    operates on the basis of a patient care fee, a prescription charge does not
    apply.</li>

<p>If you have a medical prescription from a doctor in the European Economic
Area (EEA), the prescription is valid in all other EEA countries if it contains
certain information. The EEA includes the member states of the European Union
as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.</p>

<p>There is no specific form or format required in order to be able to use a
prescription in another EEA country but the prescription must include certain
information about the patient, doctor and medical product prescribed.</p>

<p><strong>Details of the patient</strong></p>
<ul><li>Surname and first name written in full (not initials)</li>
  <li>Date of birth</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>Details of the prescribing health professional</strong></p>
<ul><li>Surname and first name written in full</li>
  <li>Professional qualification</li>
  <li>Details for direct contact (email and telephone or fax including
    international prefix)</li>
  <li>Work address (including the country)</li>
  <li>Signature</li>
  <li>Date the prescription is issued</li>
</ul><br><p><strong>Details of the prescribed product</strong></p>
<ul><li>The common name should be used rather than the brand name, which may be
    different in another country. (If a specific brand is medically necessary
    the prescription should include a brief statement of the reason.) There are
    International Nonproprietary Names recommended by the World Health
    Organisation which should be used where possible. In the case of biological
    medicinal products, brand names may be used.</li>
  <li>The format of the product, for example, whether it is in the form of
    tablets or solution.</li>
  <li>The quantity and strength.</li>
  <li>The dosage or instructions for use.</li>
</ul><br><p>Not all of these details are required for a prescription in Ireland so, if
you intend to use a prescription in another country, you should check that the
doctor has included all the necessary information listed above.</p>

<p>Prescriptions are subject to the rules of the country where they are
dispensed. For example, in some countries a prescription may only be accepted
for a certain time period after it is written.</p>

<p>Some medicines may not be authorised for sale or may not be available in
another country within the EEA. To find out if your medicine is available in
other member states, you can check with the <a href="http://hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/contact/">national contact
point for cross-border healthcare</a>.</p>

<p>If an item is required to have a special medical prescription it should not
be issued for use in another member state. This applies to controlled drugs
such as strong, opioid-based painkillers and certain sedatives.</p>

<p>You will need to <span>register</span> the birth of your child no later than
3 months after their birth. Registration is a legal requirement in Ireland, but
you will also need a birth certificate to enrol your child in school, to <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/travel_abroad/passports/applying_for_or_renewing_an_irish_passport.html">apply
for a passport</a> and for many other purposes. (For <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child
Benefit</a>, you will be contacted automatically as soon as you register the
birth.)</p>

<p>The birth certificate will contain the information on the child and the
parents that is given at the time of registration, so it is important that the
information given is accurate. It is difficult to change the details after the
initial registration. (See 'Correction of errors' below.)</p>

<p>If the parents of a child are not married to each other, there is no
presumption in law as to who the father of the child is, unless the father's
name is on the birth certificate. You can read more about establishing
paternity in the document <a shape="rect" href="../separation_and_divorce/presumption_of_paternity.html">Presumption of
paternity</a>.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0003/index.html">Civil
Registration Act 2004</a> changed some of the rules about registering a birth.
</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/25/enacted/en/html">Gender
Recognition Act 2015</a> came into effect on 4 September 2015 and provides that
a person can apply for a <a href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/GRC1.aspx">Gender Recognition
Certificate</a> in order to have their preferred gender recognised by the
State. The Act also provides for them to apply for a certified copy of an entry
in the Register of Gender Recognition. A certificate issued from the Register
of Gender Recognition is the equivalent of a birth certificate and satisfies
all requirements where a person is asked to provide a birth certificate.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>A birth may be registered in the office of any <a shape="rect" href="../registrar_birth_marr_death.html">Registrar of Births, Marriages and
Deaths</a>, regardless of where it took place. The staff of the hospital where
your child was born, or of your local health centre, will be able to tell you
where you can register the birth. The birth should be registered not later than
3 months after the date of the birth.</p>

<p>A <span>Birth Notification Form (Form BNF/01)</span> is usually completed
with the parent(s) by hospital staff (in the case of hospital births) or by a
doctor or midwife (in home births) to guarantee that correct and accurate
information is recorded. This form outlines the information to be recorded in
the Register of Births. The form is forwarded to the Registrar's office letting
the Registrar know that a birth has occurred. This is not enough, however, to
register the birth.</p>

<h3>Registering the birth</h3>

<p>The registration of the birth is carried out based on information provided
by a <span>qualified informant</span> who is required to attend at the office
of the Registrar to sign the Register of Births. The mother and father of the
child are the main qualified informants and, where possible, must attend
personally for the registration of the birth. They must bring photo
identification, for example a passport or driving licence, and their Personal
Public Service Numbers (PPS Number). In some cases, for example where a mother
has been married previously, additional material may be required and they are
advised to contact the Civil Registration Service to find out more.</p>

<p>If the parents are in a recognised marriage only one parent need attend,
however, if both wish to sign the register they should both attend. If the
parents were married in another country, they should bring the original
marriage certificate and a translation if required.</p>

<p>Where the parents do not register the birth, or it is not possible for them
to do it, the following individuals can also act as qualified informants:</p>
<ul><li>A designated member of the staff of the hospital (or other institution,
    organisation or enterprise) where the birth took place </li>
  <li>Any person present at the birth </li>
  <li>Any person present in the dwelling where the birth occurred </li>
  <li>Any person who has charge of the child </li>
  <li>A person appointed guardian of the child </li>
  <li>A person found to be the parent of the child by order of the courts </li>
</ul><h4>Information recorded</h4>

<p>The following information is recorded in the Register of Births: </p>
<ul><li>Surname of the child. The surname registered must be the surname of the
    father or mother or both. If you want your child to have a surname other
    than the surname of the father or mother or both, then an application must
    be made to the Registrar General or a Superintendent Registrar in writing.
  </li>
  <li>Time, date and place of birth of the child </li>
  <li>Gender of the child </li>
  <li>Personal Public Service Number (PPS Number) of the child (allocated at
    registration) </li>
  <li>Forename(s) and surname of the child </li>
  <li>Forename(s) and surname of the mother </li>
  <li>Birth surname of the mother </li>
  <li>All previously used surnames of the mother (if any) </li>
  <li>The mother's normal occupation </li>
  <li>The mother's normal address at the date of birth </li>
  <li>The mother's date of birth </li>
  <li>The mother's marital status </li>
  <li>The mother's Personal Public Service Number (PPS Number) </li>
  <li>Birth surname of the mother's mother </li>
  <li>Similar information is entered for the father </li>
</ul><h3>Unmarried Parents</h3>

<p>There are different options for registration, including the father's
details, where the mother and father are not married. (The forms used are
available from the Registrar's office.) The options are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Both the mother and father can jointly request the registration (Form CRA
    9). Both attend the Registrar's office together and sign the register
    jointly. </li>
  <li>The mother can complete a declaration form naming the father (Form CRA 1)
    and bring it, along with a declaration by the baby's father acknowledging
    that he is the father of the child (Form CRA 3). The mother signs the
    register. </li>
  <li>The father may complete a declaration form acknowledging that he is the
    father of the child (Form CRA 2) , and may go to the Registrar's office
    himself, bringing with him a declaration by the mother naming the father
    (Form CRA 4). The father signs the register. </li>
  <li>The mother or father may make a written request (Form CRA 5 and Form CRA
    6 respectively) on production of a certified copy of a court order which
    names the person to be registered as the father. The parent making the
    request will be required to attend at the office of the Registrar to sign
    the Register of Births. </li>
</ul><p>It is also possible to enter the father's details if the mother is or was
married to someone else. As well as a sworn declaration from the father stating
he is the father, one of the following is required:</p>
<ul><li>A sworn declaration by the mother's husband stating he is not the father,
    or</li>
  <li>A sworn delaration by the mother stating she has been living apart from
    her husband for more than 10 months before the birth of the child and a
    deed of separation/decree of divorce (not all foreign divorces are
    recognised under Irish law), or</li>
  <li>A certified copy of a court order which names the person to be registered
    as the father </li>
</ul><p>A <a shape="rect" href="http://www.treoir.ie/cms-assets/documents/updated%20leaflets%2028th%20feb/16548-281958.registration-of-births-of-children.pdf">leaflet
on Birth Registration of Children (pdf)</a> is available on <a shape="rect" href="http://www.treoir.ie/">Treoir's website</a>.</p>

<h3>Re-registration</h3>

<p>A birth can only be re-registered:</p>
<ul><li>If the parents of a child are not married to each other but wish to have
    the father's details included and these details were not registered
    initially, or</li>
  <li>If the parents of a child marry each other after the birth of the
  child</li>
</ul><p>The child's surname can be changed at the joint request of both parents when
re-registering the birth. </p>

information is required.</p>

child’s forename registered, added or changed. There is a fee. Contact the

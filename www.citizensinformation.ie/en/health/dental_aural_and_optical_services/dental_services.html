<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) provides some free dental treatment to
certain citizens through the public health service. Services are provided by
dentists employed by <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">Local Health Offices</a> in
your area and by private dentists who have contracts with the HSE to provide
certain services. </p>

<p>If you do not qualify for HSE services, then you may be treated by a private
dental practitioner. Dentists must display private fees in a place where
patients can view them before consultation. A single fee must apply for some
procedures while the fees for others may be shown as a range, with a minimum
and maximum clearly stated. Where a range of fees applies, it is not permitted
to set a minimum price only.</p>

<p>The Dental Council has produced a <a href="http://dentalcouncil.ie/files/Display%20of%20Private%20Fees%20-%20Code%20of%20Practice%20(Feb%202011)%20-%2020110330.pdf">Code
of Practice relating to: Display of Private Fees in Dental Practices
(pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Treatment Benefit Scheme</h3>

<p>You may get free dental examinations under the <a shape="rect" href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/treatment_benefit_scheme.html">Treatment
Benefit</a> scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection. </p>

<h3>Medical card holders</h3>

<p>The Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) provides access to dental
treatment for adult <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical
card</a> holders (over 16 years of age). Medical card holders are entitled to a
free dental examination and two fillings in each calendar year as well as any
extractions that are required. Free emergency dental treatment for relief of
pain and sepsis is also available.</p>

<p>For most other treatments, including dentures, the dentist must apply for
prior approval from the HSE. Patients with special needs, high risk patients
and those who have greater clinical needs receive priority. </p>

<p>The DTSS provides treatment for periodontal/gum disease in cases where care
is especially warranted. This includes clients who are pregnant, have diabetes
or immuno-compromising conditions, or require relevant surgical procedures such
as cardiac surgery and joint replacements. Approval for periodontal treatment
may be given by the local Principal Dental Surgeon for these and other high
risk or special needs groups. </p>

<h3>Clinical Dental Technicians</h3>

<p>Clinical Dental Technicians are dental healthcare professionals, registered
with the <a href="http://www.dentalcouncil.ie/">Dental Council</a>, who provide
complete dentures and partial dentures directly to adult patients when the
patientâ€™s oral health is established through a recent visit to a dentist.
They do not carry out work on natural teeth or on living tissue.</p>

<p>Clinical Dental Technicians who have a contract with the HSE can treat
medical card holders under the Dental Treatment Services Scheme, providing
approved dentures and relines as well as denture repairs and additions.</p>

<h3>Orthodontic treatment</h3>

<p>The HSE provides free orthodontic treatment for those patients with the most
severe orthodontic problems. The criteria used to decide whether a child
qualifies for treatment in the HSE is determined by eligibility guidelines
based on an international grading system called the Index of Orthodontic
Treatment Need. </p>

<p>HSE dental surgeons are trained in the guidelines for eligibility and so can
advise and refer you to the local HSE orthodontic unit for assessment if the
problem is sufficiently severe. The types of orthodontic problems that qualify
under the guidelines include front teeth that are buried and fail to emerge,
multiple missing teeth, very prominent front teeth or severe problems with the
bite or jaw development.<br></p>

<h3>Taxation and dental expenses</h3>

<p>If you do not have a medical card and have to pay for dental services from a
private practitioner, you may claim tax relief for certain specialised dental
treatments. (Routine treatments such as extractions, scaling and filling of
teeth and provision and repairing of artificial teeth and dentures are excluded
from tax relief). Further information on how to claim tax relief for specific
dental costs incurred by you whether for yourself, your spouse, your dependent
child or a dependent relative are available in our document on <a shape="rect" href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/taxation_and_medical_expenses.html">taxation
and medical expenses</a>. </p>

<p>Dental services for children under 16 years of age who attend state primary
schools, and are referred from child and school health services, are provided

<p>Services for others who are entitled to dental treatment are provided in HSE
clinics or by private practitioners who have agreements with the HSE. The HSE
decides whether you will be treated by one of its dentists or by a private
practitioner. If you are to be treated by a private practitioner, you can
choose from the list of dentists who have agreements with the HSE to provide
services.</p>

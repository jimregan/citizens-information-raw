<p>Optometric or ophthalmology services provided through the public health
service are provided free of charge to certain people by optometrists,
dispensing opticians and ophtalmologists. </p>

<p>While some of these health professionals are employed directly by the Health
Service Executive (HSE), the majority of those providing these services do so
on a contract basis. Optometrists (formerly known as ophtalmic opticians)
examine your eyes to diagnose vision problems. They use instruments and
observation to examine eye health and to test your visual acuity, depth and
colour perception and your ability to focus and co-ordinate your eyes.
Optometrists can also prescribe spectacles and contact lenses. </p>

<p>Dispensing opticians recommend and dispense spectacle frames, lenses,
contact lenses, etc., having considered your prescription, your occupation,
lifestyle, hobbies, etc. A dispensing optician <span>cannot prescribe</span>
prescription spectacles or contact lenses for you. Instead, they can only
dispense and recommend spectacles and contact lenses that would be most
suitable for you, given your lifestyle. </p>

<p>Ophthalmologists are physicians who perform eye surgery and diagnose and
treat eye diseases and injuries. Ophthalmologists can also examine eyes and
prescribe spectacles and contact lenses. </p>

<h3>Treatment Benefit Scheme</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/treatment_benefit_scheme.html">Treatment
Benefit Scheme</a> is operated by the Department of Social Protection. Under
this scheme, you may qualify for Dental Benefit, Optical Benefit, contact
lenses, and hearing aids on the basis of your PRSI contributions. </p>

<h3>Diabetic RetinaScreen</h3>

<p>For people with diabetes aged 12 or over, the National Diabetic Retinal
Screening Programme offers free, regular screening for diabetic retinopathy, a
complication of diabetes that can damage eyesight. For more information see <a href="http://www.diabeticretinascreen.ie">diabeticretinascreen.ie</a>.<br></p>

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) provides aural services, including
hearing tests and hearing aids, to eligible people. In general, aural services
are provided by the HSE's own professionals but in some cases may be provided
by private practitioners.</p>

<h3>Hearing tests</h3>

<p>You will normally be referred by your family doctor (GP) to an audiologist
or an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for a hearing test. It may also be
possible to contact your hearing aid clinic or health centre directly and
request a hearing test. Hearing tests involve an examination of your ear by the
audiologist or ENT specialist. You will then be asked to put on headphones and
listen to sounds at different pitches so the audiologist can find the level at
which you can no longer hear. </p>

<p>Hearing tests can also be conducted on infants and very young children who
are unable to wear headphones or communicate that they cannot hear sounds.
Tests on infants or young children are similar to those conducted on adults
(they are non-invasive) and are carried out using specialist sonar equipment.
The level of the child's hearing is then measured and any corrective action is
prescribed. </p>

<h3>Hearing aids</h3>

<p>If you have a medical card or belong to the eligible groups mentioned below,
you can obtain your hearing aid free of charge. If you do not have a medical
card, your hearing aid clinic will put you in touch with suppliers of hearing
aids and you will have to pay for your hearing aid yourself. </p>

<h3>Treatment Benefit Scheme</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/treatment_benefit_scheme.html">Treatment
Benefit</a> is a scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection that
provides dental, optical and aural services to insured workers and retired
people who have the required number of PRSI contributions.</p>

<p>Hearing aids may be provided by <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Medical-Appliance-Suppliers.aspx">suppliers
who have a contract with the Department of Social Protection</a>. The
Department pays half the cost of a hearing aid subject to a fixed maximum for
each hearing aid every 4 years. It also pays half the cost of repairs to
hearing aids.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Aural services are available free of charge to: </p>
<ul><li>Medical card holders and their dependants </li>
  <li>People with Hepatitis C who have a <a href="../blood_and_organ_donation/hepatitis_c_and_health_amendment_act_cards.html">Health
    Amendment Act Card</a> </li>
  <li>Pre-school children and primary school children referred from <a shape="rect" href="../children_s_health/child_health_services.html">child
    health service</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../children_s_health/school_health_services.html">school health
    service</a> examinations </li>
</ul><p>Children who are discovered to have hearing problems at the child or school
health examinations are referred to the appropriate consultant for treatment.
If this treatment is carried out at the out-patient department of a public
hospital, the service is free and no <a shape="rect" href="../hospital_services/hospital_charges.html">hospital charges</a> have to

<p>Medical card holders can obtain a replacement hearing aid after 2 years but
if your hearing aid is damaged or broken you can get a replacement before the
end of the 2-year period.</p>

<p>If you do not have a medical card, the Treatment Benefit Scheme may cover
you and your dependent spouse for some of the cost of hearing aids. You may
also be able to claim <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/taxation_and_medical_expenses.html">tax
relief for medical expenses</a> incurred.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Organ donation takes healthy tissues and organs from one person so that they
can be transplanted into another person, replacing organs that are not
healthy.</p>

<p>Organs which are suitable for transplant include the heart, kidneys, lungs,
liver and pancreas.</p>

<p>Certain organs, such as a kidney, can be donated by a living donor who can
live a healthy lifestyle without the organ. To become a living donor, <a href="../../legal_matters_and_health/consent_to_medical_and_surgical_procedures.html">you
must give informed consent</a>.</p>

<p>Most organs are only transplanted after the death of the donor.</p>

<p>You can become an organ donor <a href="http://www.ika.ie/card">by carrying a
donor card or using the Organ Donor Ecard smartphone app</a>, or having your
wishes noted on your driving licence. You should tell your family or
next-of-kin that you wish to donate your organs after your death. Your family
or next-of-kin can inform a doctor or another healthcare professional in a
hospital if they are asked about your wishes regarding organ donation. </p>

<p>Having a medical condition does not prevent you from becoming a donor (an
individual decision will be made by a healthcare professional at the time of
your death). </p>

<p><span>The medical team treating you if you are ill is separate from the
transplant team. Organs are only removed when 2 doctors, working independently,
have certified that the person is dead following a series of strict
tests</span>. </p>

<p>It is important to know that the removal of organs is carried out with the
same care and respect as any other operation. Organ donation does not disfigure
the body or change the way it looks nor does it cause any delay to funeral
arrangements. </p>

<p><strong>Organ donors and consent</strong></p>

<p>You can indicate your wishes by carrying an organ donor card or signing the
organ donation option on the back of your driving licence. Organ donor cards
are available from the Irish Donor Network (see below), through the Irish
Kidney Association, and in doctors' surgeries and pharmacies. </p>

<p>Signing an organ donor card or a driving licence donation option indicates
your willingness to have your organs used for transplant. It does not
necessarily mean that they will be used. There are various medical criteria and
other conditions that must be met. To ensure safe transplantation, the death
must take place in a hospital. Your next-of-kin should know of your wish to be
an organ donor, but they are not bound to abide by your wishes and their
consent is always required. </p>

<p>In all cases, the medical team requests the next-of-kin to donate the organs
of a deceased person. In practice, the consent of the next-of-kin is accepted
as valid and a refusal by the next-of-kin <span>is not contested</span>. </p>

<h3>Postmortems and organ donation</h3>

<p>In situations where a death is reported to the Coroner, permission must be
obtained from the Coroner before organ donation can take place, as well as the
written consent of the next-of-kin. Where the Coroner grants permission for
organ donation, any subsequent postmortem examination will be a limited one.
Decisions about this matter are made by the Coroner in consultation with the
Garda√≠ and medical professionals. In general, Coroners do facilitate requests
for organ donation. Read more about the <a shape="rect" href="/en/death/sudden_or_unexplained_death/coroners.html">role of the Coroner</a>
and <a shape="rect" href="/en/death/sudden_or_unexplained_death/postmortems.html">postmortems</a>
here.</p>

<p>Organ donation for transplantation is not a postmortem practice and it is
conducted in an operating theatre. Consent for the retention of organs for
research is a postmortem practice conducted in a mortuary. </p>

<h3>The Irish Donor Network</h3>

<p>The Irish Donor Network is a group of individuals and patient associations
directly concerned with organ transplantation, donor families and medical
co-ordinators involved in organ and tissue transplantation. Those involved in
the Network are: </p>
<ul><li>Donor families </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ika.ie/">The Irish Kidney Association</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ihlta.com/">The Irish Heart and Lung Transplant
    Association</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.cfireland.ie/">The Cystic Fibrosis
  Association</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ilfa.ie/">The Irish Lung Fibrosis Association</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.alpha1.ie/">Alpha One (Anti Trypsin)
  Foundation</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.stvincents.ie/departments/Liver_Transplant_Unit.html">Liver
    Transplant Unit in St.Vincent's Hospital</a></li>
  <li>Hospital Transplant Co-ordinators</li>
  <li>The Eye and Bone Banks</li>
</ul><p>The Irish Eye Bank no longer accepts ocular donations. (This is due to the
theoretical risk that nvCJD could be transmitted in transplanted corneas.) All
corneas and sclera are now imported from the United States of America.</p>

<p>The Irish Donor Network promotes, prints and distributes the Gift of Life
Donor Card. By carrying the card and informing your family, you indicate your
intention of donating organs and tissue for the purpose of transplantation in
the event of your death.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l77020">Whole body donation for medical research</h2>

<p>Medical research is a vital way in which the health profession can learn
more about anatomy, research and treating illness. </p>

<p>If you want to donate your body for medical research, you should contact one
of the 5 medical research schools located in the colleges listed below. Each
medical school has its own procedures for entering into an agreement with you.
</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.ucd.ie/medicine/bodydonation/">University College
    Dublin</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.medicine.tcd.ie/anatomy/donations/">Trinity College
    Dublin</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.rcsi.ie/anatomy-donations-of-remains">The Royal College of
    Surgeons in Ireland</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="https://www.ucc.ie/en/anatomy/anatomicalbequests/">University College
    Cork</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.nuigalway.ie/medicine-nursing-and-health-sciences/school-of-medicine/anatomy/donorprogramme/">National
    University of Ireland, Galway</a></li>
</ul><p>You should also make sure that your next-of-kin are aware of your wishes.
You can do this by telling them and/or stating that you wish to donate your
body for medical research in your <a shape="rect" href="/en/death/before_a_death/making_a_will.html">will</a>. The law is unclear on
this but it would seem that your next-of-kin, or whoever is responsible for the
cremation or interment of your body, are not necessarily obliged to go along
with your wishes. <br></p>

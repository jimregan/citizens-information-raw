<p>Both private and public health services are available in Ireland.</p>

<p>Private health services are provided by individual health professionals or
healthcare companies. You usually pay the full cost of private health services.
You can take out <a href="health_system/private_health_insurance.html">private health
insurance</a> to help meet the cost of medical expenses.</p>

<p>Public services are supported by the State. The <a href="health_system/health_boards.html">Health Service Executive (HSE)</a>
is responsible for the delivery of public health services. Sometimes the HSE
provides these services directly and sometimes the HSE funds other
organisations to provide these services. </p>

<p>You are covered by public health services if you are living in Ireland and
have lived here, or intend to live here, for at least one year. This is called
being ordinarily resident in Ireland. <a href="health_system/entitlement_to_public_health_services.html">Read more
information about ordinary residency and public health services here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="health_system/health_services_and_visitors_to_ireland.html">Some
visitors may be entitled to public health services</a>, for example, people
from other countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) or from Switzerland.
</p>

<p>If you are resident in Ireland you can <a href="eu_healthcare/travelling_for_healthcare.html">access healthcare in
Europe</a>.</p>

<h3>General Practitioners</h3>

<p>General Practitioners (GPs) are family doctors. A GP is often the first
doctor people see about a health problem. GPs are usually part of the private
healthcare system and so you will usually need to pay charges when you see a
GP. You can see a GP without being charged for the visit if you have a medical
card or a GP Visit Card.</p>

<p>GPs provide referrals to more specialised doctors called consultants. You
cannot see a consultant for the first time without a referral from a GP.</p>

<p>Some GPs will also call to your home if you are sick. Often, a number of GPs
in an area will arrange to make a service available at night or at the
weekend.</p>

<h3>Medical card</h3>

<p>If your income is below a certain level you may get a <a href="medical_cards_and_gp_visit_cards/medical_card.html">medical card</a>.
(Some people can get a card without an income test, for example, children who
have cancer.)</p>

<p>With a medical card you can get public health services free of charge,
including <a href="health_services/gp_and_hospital_services/gp_services_to_medical_card_holders.html">doctor
visits</a> and public <a href="health_services/gp_and_hospital_services/hospital_services_introduction.html">hospital
services</a>.</p>

<p>The medical card covers the cost of prescription medicines but you pay a set
charge when you get the medicines – this <a href="drugs_and_medicines/prescription_charges_for_medical_card_holders.html">prescription
charge</a> is the same for each item.</p>

<h3>GP visit card</h3>

<p>If your income is above the limit for a medical card, you may be able to get
a <a href="medical_cards_and_gp_visit_cards/gp_visit_cards.html">GP visit
card</a>. It has an income test with a higher limit. The GP visit card only
covers free visits to your family doctor. The income test isn’t required for
anyone under the age of 6 or over the age of 70 – everyone in these age
groups can get a GP visit card.</p>

<h3>Health Centres</h3>

<p>You can access community health and personal social services through the <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">Local Health Office</a> for
your area. These services are provided by a number of Local Health Centres in
each area. The range of services provided varies in different areas but
includes nursing care, chiropody, speech therapy, physiotherapy, mental health
services and more. Sometimes health services can be provided in your own home.
For older people or people with disabilities, it may also be possible for the
health centre to organise help with housework through a <a href="health_services/care_in_your_community/home_helps.html">home help</a>
service.</p>

<h3>Hospital services</h3>

<p>You can be referred to hospital as a public patient or as a private patient.
You may use <a href="health_services/gp_and_hospital_services/hospital_services_introduction.html">hospital
services as an outpatient or an inpatient</a>. This section gives an
introduction to this system. You can <a href="health_services/gp_and_hospital_services/hospital_charges.html">read
detailed information about hospital charges here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Out-patient services</strong></p>

<p>You may be referred by your family doctor (GP) to the out-patient department
of a public hospital, for example, to be seen by a specialist consultant or for
diagnostic tests like x-rays.</p>

<p>Accident and emergency services are outpatient services and if you are
referred by a GP there is no charge. If you visit an accident and emergency
department without being referred by a GP there is a set charge.</p>

<p>To visit a consultant (medical specialist) you must be referred by a GP. As
a public patient, you do not have to pay for the consultant’s services and
you do not get to choose your consultant. In many areas, there are waiting
lists for non-emergency services.</p>

<p>If you choose to be referred to a consultant as a private patient, you pay
for the consultant’s services. Private hospitals set their own charges. If
you have <a href="health_system/private_health_insurance.html">private
health insurance</a>, it may cover some or all of the charges.</p>

<p><strong>In-patient services</strong></p>

<p>You may be admitted to hospital as an in-patient under the care of a
consultant.</p>

<p>If you are in a public hospital as a public patient, and you do not have a
medical card, there is a set daily in-patient charge. There is maximum limit to
how much you will be charged over a 12-month period.</p>

<p>If you are admitted to a public hospital as a private patient of a
consultant, you pay a different daily in-patient hospital charge.</p>

<h3>Drugs and medicines</h3>

<p>If you are <a href="health_system/entitlement_to_public_health_services.html">ordinarily
resident</a> in Ireland, you can get free or subsidised <a href="drugs_and_medicines/prescribed_drugs_and_medicines.html">prescribed
drugs and medicines</a> and certain medical and surgical aids and
appliances.</p>

<p>There is a set <a href="drugs_and_medicines/prescription_charges_for_medical_card_holders.html">prescription
charge for medical card holders</a>. If you don’t have a medical card, you
can get help with the cost of prescribed medicines under the <a href="drugs_and_medicines/drugs_payment_scheme.html">Drugs Payment
Scheme</a>. People suffering from certain conditions can get free medicines for
the treatment of those conditions under the <a href="drugs_and_medicines/long_term_illness_scheme.html">Long Term Illness
Scheme</a>.</p>

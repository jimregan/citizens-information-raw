<p>Assisted human reproduction services (including In Vitro Fertilisation or
IVF) are not provided by the public health services. Any services that are
provided are not currently subject to statutory control. Laws in relation to
the area have been passed but are not yet in force. Medical practice concerning
the provision of assisted human reproduction services is governed by guidelines
issued by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.medicalcouncil.ie">Irish Medical
Council</a>. </p>
</div>
In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) is available from private consultants and clinics.

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>IVF is not provided by the public health services. Your family doctor (GP)
may refer you to the private specialists and clinics that provide the service
or you may be able to contact the clinic directly for an appointment.</p>

<p>The Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction completed its report on how
assisted human reproduction might be regulated in April 2005. <a shape="rect" href="http://health.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Report-of-The-Commission-on-Assisted-Human-Reproduction.pdf">View
the Report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction here (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/9/enacted/en/html">Children
and Family Relationships Act 2015</a> includes laws on assisted human
reproduction but these have not yet come into force. You can <a href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/downloads/relate/relate_2015_05.pdf">read
more about the Act in our publication Relate (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.medicalcouncil.ie/News-and-Publications/Reports/Guide-to-Professional-Conduct-and-Ethics-8th-Edition-2016-.pdf">The
Medical Council has ethical guidelines (pdf)</a> that include a section on
assisted human reproduction and set out the conditions under which it is
ethical for a doctor to provide IVF treatment. </p>

<h3>Tax relief and fertility treatment</h3>

<p>You may claim tax relief on the costs involved in IVF treatment as part of
the <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/taxation_and_medical_expenses.html">tax
relief for medical expenses scheme</a>. </p>

<h3>Drugs Payment Scheme</h3>

<p>Drugs used as part of fertility treatment are also covered under the <a href="../entitlement_to_health_services/drugs_payment_scheme.html">Drugs
Payment Scheme</a>. Under the Drugs Payment Scheme there is a limit to how much
you have to pay for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances in a
given month. </p>

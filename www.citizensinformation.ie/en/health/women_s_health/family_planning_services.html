<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>Advice on contraception and prescriptions for contraceptive drugs and
devices are provided by GPs, voluntary organisations and specialist private
family planning clinics. The <a href="http://www.crisispregnancy.ie/">Crisis
Pregnancy Programme</a> provides the website <a href="http://www.thinkcontraception.ie/">thinkcontraception.ie</a> for
information about contraceptive options and services.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you have a <a href="../entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical card</a>,
you are entitled to free GP services including contraceptive advice and
prescriptions for contraceptive drugs and devices. If you do not have a medical
card, the costs of contraceptive drugs and devices may be included in the
subsidy arrangements for <a href="../entitlement_to_health_services/prescribed_drugs_and_medicines.html">prescribed
drugs and medicines</a>.</p>

<p>Voluntary and private family planning clinics also provide contraceptive
services. The voluntary providers usually have charges but may waive them or
have lower fees in certain cases.</p>

<h3>Age</h3>

<p>There is no set minimum age in Ireland at which contraceptive advice and
prescriptions may be provided. The age of consent to sexual activity is 17 and
it may be a criminal offence to have sex with a person under the age of 17.
This means that providers of contraceptive services are entitled to refuse to
provide those services to people under 17. In general the age of consent for
health services purposes is 16.</p>

<h3>Surgical procedures</h3>

<p>The decision to have a sterilisation operation for family planning purposes
is a matter for the patient in consultation with their doctor or specialist.</p>

<p>Your entitlement to free services is the same as for <a shape="rect" href="../hospital_services/hospital_services_introduction.html">public hospital
services</a> generally. These procedures are also available in some private
hospitals, where the full cost is payable.</p>

<h3>Crisis pregnancies</h3>

<p>A crisis pregnancy is an unplanned pregnancy that represents a personal
crisis for the pregnant woman.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.crisispregnancy.ie/">Crisis Pregnancy Programme</a>
aims to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies by the provision of education,
advice and contraceptive services.</p>

<p>It also funds crisis pregnancy counselling services. Information about these
services is available at <a href="http://www.positiveoptions.ie/">positiveoptions.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>Abortion</h3>

<p>Abortion is illegal in Ireland except where there is a real and substantial
risk to the life of the mother. This includes a risk arising from a threat of
suicide. The <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=24271&amp;CatID=87">Protection
of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013</a> sets out the law in this area and the
Department of Health has issued <a href="http://health.gov.ie/blog/press-release/guidance-document-published-for-protection-of-life-during-pregnancy-act-2013/">guidelines
for health professionals</a>.</p>
</div>
Women in Ireland <span>may not be prevented</span> from travelling abroad to
get an abortion. It <span>is lawful</span> to provide information about
abortion abroad, subject to strict conditions. It is <span>not lawful</span> to
encourage or advocate an abortion in individual circumstances. </div>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Maternity and Infant Care Scheme provides an agreed programme of care to
all expectant mothers who are <a shape="rect" href="../entitlement_to_health_services/entitlement_to_public_health_services.html">ordinarily
resident</a> in Ireland. This service is provided by a family doctor (GP) of
your choice and a hospital obstetrician. You are entitled to this service even
if you do not have a medical card or GP visit card. Virtually all GPs have
agreements with the <a shape="rect" href="http://hse.ie">Health Service
Executive (HSE)</a> to provide these services; they do not have to be part of
the <a shape="rect" href="../entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical card</a>
scheme. The Maternity and Infant Care Scheme also provides for two post-natal
visits to the GP.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The combined medical services are provided by your family doctor (GP) and a
hospital obstetrician.</p>

<p>On your first pregnancy, the GP provides an initial examination, if possible
before 12 weeks, and a further 5 examinations during the pregnancy, which are
alternated with visits to the maternity unit/hospital. The schedule of visits
may be changed by your GP and/or hospital obstetrician, depending on your
individual situation. For subsequent pregnancies you will have an initial
examination and a further 6 examinations.</p>

<p>If you have a significant illness, for example, diabetes or hypertension,
you may have up to 5 additional visits to the GP. </p>

<p>After the birth, the GP will examine the baby at 2 weeks and both mother and
baby at 6 weeks. </p>

<h3>Charges</h3>

<p>The mother is entitled to free in-patient, out-patient and accident and
emergency/casualty services in public hospitals in respect of the pregnancy and
the birth and is not liable for <a shape="rect" href="../hospital_services/hospital_charges.html">hospital charges</a>.</p>

<p>Care for other illnesses which you may have at this time, but which are not
related to your pregnancy is not covered by the Scheme.</p>

<p>However, if you opt to be a private patient of your consultant, you will be
liable for the full range of in-patient charges.</p>

<h3>Infant care services</h3>

<p>The public health nurse visits the mother and baby at home free of charge,
usually within 72 hours of returning home from hospital.</p>

<p>The GP who attends the mother also provides care for the new-born baby. They
will provide two developmental examinations free of charge at 2 weeks and 6
weeks following the birth. </p>

<p>The baby's entitlement to other free GP services depends on whether they
have a medical card or GP visit card. This means that visits to the GP for any
conditions related to the baby's health during this six-week period or
afterwards are not covered by the scheme unless the baby has a medical card or
GP visit card. See below for details of how to apply.</p>

<h3>Medical tests</h3>

<p>If the baby is born in a hospital, it is usual to carry out screening for
metabolic disorders (the Guthrie or heel prick test). If the baby is born at
home, the test may be carried out by the GP or in the out-patients department
of a hospital. This test requires parental consent. </p>

<p>You can find out more about this test on <a href="http://www.newbornscreening.ie/">newbornscreening.ie</a>.</p>

<p>There is a range of <a href="../../employment/employment_and_disability/">employment supports for
people with disabilities</a> to help with getting a job and staying in
employment. The Department of Social Protection provides these supports through
local employment services offices and Intreo centres.</p>

<p><a href="../../education/vocational_education_and_training/fas_training_allowances.html">Vocational
training</a> is provided by SOLAS.</p>

<p>The Department of Health has responsibility for rehabilitative training
(training that is not linked to the labour force) and sheltered work.
Responsibility for the delivery of these services rests with the Health Service
Executive (HSE). Rehabilitative training and sheltered work is provided largely
in:</p>
<ul><li>Accredited training centres that are run by the HSE or by service
    providers contracted by the HSE and </li>
  <li>Designated sheltered workshops</li>
</ul><p>Rehabilitative training focuses on the development of an individual's life
skills, social skills and basic work skills with the objective of enhancing the
trainee's quality of life and general work capacity. </p>

<p>The HSE has appointed Directors of Disability Services who are responsible,
among other things, for the delivery of rehabilitative training services. The
HSE have teams of guidance counsellors who offer information, advice and
guidance on HSE training and sheltered work services.</p>

<h3>Sheltered workshops</h3>
</div>
Sheltered work gives people with disabilities the opportunity to take part in
daily work in a sheltered setting where they receive personal support services.

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>The National Intellectual Disability Database is a database of information
about people who are receiving intellectual disability services in Ireland or
who are in need of these services. The objective of the database is to ensure
that accurate information is available about the needs of people with
intellectual disabilities. Services are planned and co-ordinated on the basis
of the information contained in the database.</p>
</div>
There is also a <a shape="rect" href="physical_and_sensory_disability_database.html">National Physical and
Sensory Disability Database</a>.<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The information on the database is gathered by service providers who are in
contact with people with intellectual disabilities. For example, Local Health
Offices, voluntary bodies, and school principals. The information is given to
Health Service Executive <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">Local Health Offices</a>.</p>

<p>The information is collected at national level, without any personal details
such as name or address, and it is analysed by the <a href="http://www.hrb.ie/">Health Research Board</a>. The statistical
information is used to monitor current service provision and to predict future
service requirements.</p>

<h3>Access to the database</h3>

<p>If there are details about you on the database, these details may be
accessed by: </p>
<ul><li>You (or, for a child, by the parents or guardians) </li>
  <li>By a small number of people working for your service provider and/or your
    Local Health Office </li>
</ul><br><p>The statistical information from the database, that is, information that
does not identify any individual person is available to: </p>
<ul><li>The <a shape="rect" href="http://health.gov.ie">Department of Health</a>
  </li>
  <li>The Health Research Board </li>
  <li>Approved researchers </li>
</ul><p>A National Database Committee considers requests for access to statistical
information from the database and where it is appropriate, makes this
information available. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hrb.ie/health-information-in-house-research/disability/nidd-publications/">National
Intellectual Disability Database Committee issues an Annual Report</a> each
year containing information on the current level of service provision. </p>

<h3>Data protection</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/data_protection.html">Data
Protection Act, 1988</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0006/index.html">Data

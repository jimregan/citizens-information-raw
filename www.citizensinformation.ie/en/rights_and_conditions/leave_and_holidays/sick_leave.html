<p>In general, an employee has no right under employment law to be paid while
on sick leave. Consequently, it is at the discretion of the employer to decide
their own policy on sick pay and sick leave, subject to the employeeâ€™s
contract or terms of employment. Under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0005/sec0003.html">Section
3</a> of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0005/index.html">Terms of
Employment (Information) Act 1994</a> an employer must provide an employee with
a written statement of terms of employment within two months of the
commencement of the employment. One of the terms referred to in this Act on
which the employer must provide information is the terms or conditions relating
to incapacity for work due to sickness or injury.</p>

<p>You may apply for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">Illness
Benefit</a> if you have enough social insurance contributions. If you do not
have enough social insurance contributions, you should contact the <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/how_health_is_organised/health_boards_and_community_welfare_officers.html">Department
of Social Protection's representative (formerly the Community Welfare
Officer)</a> at your local health centre who will assess your situation. </p>

<p>If you are entitled to sick pay, your employer will probably require you to
sign over any Illness Benefit payment from the Department of Social Protection
to your employer for as long as the sick pay continues. </p>

<p>Often, your contract of employment will place a maximum period of sick pay
entitlement in a stated period, for example, one month's sick pay in any
12-month period. Clear rules should be put in place by the employer where an
employee is sick and is unavailable for work. For example, it should be clear
that if you are sick and unavailable for work, you must contact a specified
person by a certain time. </p>

<p><strong>Medical certificates:</strong> Your employer can require you to
provide a medical certificate (from your GP or family doctor) when you are on
sick leave. For example, you may have to provide a medical certificate if you
are out sick for more than 2 consecutive days. The medical certificate should
state the date you are likely to return to work. If you are likely to be out
sick for a longer period, your employer may require you provide weekly medical
certificates. The <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pressoffice/Pages/pr220915.aspx">Department of
Social Protection has issued guidelines to assist GPs in certifying
patients</a>. These guidelines provide defined periods of expected recovery and
return to work in respect of common medical conditions and surgical
procedures.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, where an employee has consistently been absent from
work (or if through illness is no longer capable of continuing work),
employment may be terminated. Employees are protected in certain circumstances
in this instance through the <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfair
dismissals</a> legislation. </p>

<p>If you are unsure about whether or not you are entitled to sick pay, you
should consult your <a shape="rect" href="../contracts_of_employment/contract_of_employment.html">contract of
employment</a> or speak to your employer.</p>

<p>An employee who does not receive sick pay as their terms of employment may
make a complaint under the Payment of Wages Act using the online complaint form
available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>Accident or injury at work</h3>

<p>If you have an accident at work and you are not entitled to sick pay, you
can apply for <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/injury_benefit.html">Injury
Benefit.</a> This is a weekly payment from the Department of Social Protection
if you are unfit for work due to an accident at work or an occupational
disease. Under the <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/medical_care_scheme.html">Medical
Care Scheme</a> you can claim certain medical costs that are not paid by the
Health Service Executive (HSE) or covered by Treatment Benefit Scheme. You can
find out more about these payments in <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/occupational_injuries_benefit_overview.html">our
document on the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme.</a></p>

<p>If you are entitled to sick pay, your employer will probably require you to
sign over any Injury Benefit payment from the Department of Social Protection
to your employer for as long as the sick pay continues.</p>

<p>If you have suffered an injury at work, you can seek compensation from your
employer by making a personal injury claim through <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/civil_law/personal_injuries_assessment_board.html">InjuriesBoard.ie</a>.
You can read more about this in <a href="../health_and_safety/health_safety_work.html">our document on health
and safety in the workplace.</a></p>

<h3>Sick leave during public holidays</h3>

<p>If you are a full time worker who is on sick leave during a <a shape="rect" href="public_holidays_in_ireland.html">public holiday,</a> you are entitled to
benefit for the public holiday you missed. If you are a part-time worker on
sick leave during a public holiday, you would be entitled to time off work for
the public holiday provided you worked for your employer at least 40 hours in
the previous 5-week period. </p>

<p>However, you are not entitled to the public holiday if you are absent from
work immediately before the public holiday and you have been off work for more
than 26 weeks due to an ordinary illness or accident, or for more than 52 weeks
due to an occupational accident.</p>

<h3>Sick leave and annual leave</h3>

<p>If you are ill during your annual leave and have a medical certificate for
the days you were ill, these sick days will not be counted as annual leave
days. Instead, you can use these days as annual leave at a later date. An
employer cannot require you to take annual leave for a certified period of
illness.</p>

<p>Since 1 August 2015, you <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/News-And-Events/Department-News/2015/August/04082015.html">accumulate
statutory annual leave entitlement during a period of certified sick leave</a>.
Employees on long-term sick leave can retain annual leave they could not take
due to illness for up to 15 months after the end of the year in which it is
accrued. Workers who leave their employment within 15 months of the end of the
year in which this annual leave was accrued, are entitled to payment in lieu of
this leave which was untaken due to illness. </p>

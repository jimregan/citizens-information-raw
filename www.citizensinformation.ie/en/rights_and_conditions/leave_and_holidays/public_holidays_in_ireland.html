<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>There are 9 public holidays in Ireland each year. Public holidays may
commemorate a special day or other event, for example, St Patrick's Day (17
March) or Christmas Day (25 December). On a public holiday, sometimes called a
<em>bank holiday</em>, most businesses and schools close. Other services, for
example, public transport still operate but often with restricted schedules.
The list of public holidays each year is as follows: </p>
<ul><li>New Year's Day (1 January) </li>
  <li>St. Patrick's Day (17 March) </li>
  <li>Easter Monday </li>
  <li>First Monday in May, June, August </li>
  <li>Last Monday in October </li>
  <li>Christmas Day (25 December) </li>
  <li>St. Stephen's Day (26 December) </li>
</ul><p>Good Friday <strong>is not a public holiday</strong>. While some schools and
businesses close on that day, you have no automatic entitlement to time off
work on that day. </p>

<h3>How is the date of Easter Monday determined each year? </h3>

<p>Easter Monday is the only public holiday that can vary significantly from
year to year. The date of Easter moves every year within the international
calendar for civil use. Broadly speaking, Easter should be the first Sunday
after the first full moon occurring on or after 21 March. This means that the
earliest possible date for Easter Sunday in any year is 22 March, the latest is
25 April. Easter Monday will fall on the following dates between 2017 and 2020:
17 April 2017, 2 April 2018, 22 April 2019, 13 April 2020.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Your entitlement to public holidays is set out in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/index.html">Organisation
of Working Time Act 1997</a>. Most employees are entitled to paid leave on
public holidays. One exception is part-time employees who have not worked for
their employer at least 40 hours in total in the 5 weeks before the public
holiday. </p>

<p>Employees who qualify for public holiday benefit will be entitled to one of
the following:</p>
<ul><li>A paid day off on the public holiday </li>
  <li>An additional day of annual leave </li>
  <li>An additional day's pay </li>
  <li>A paid day off within a month of the public holiday </li>
</ul><p>The Organisation of Working Time Act provides that you may ask your employer
at least 21 days before a public holiday, which of the alternatives will apply.
If your employer fails to respond at least 14 days before the public holiday,
you are entitled to take the actual public holiday as a paid day off.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/si/0475.html">Organisation of
Working Time (Determination of Pay For Holidays) Regulations (SI 475/1997)</a>
set out the appropriate rate of daily pay.</p>

<h3>Part-time employees</h3>

<p>If you have worked for your employer at least 40 hours in the 5 weeks before
the public holiday and the public holiday falls on a day you normally work you
are entitled to a day's pay for the public holiday. If you are required to work
that day you are entitled to an additional day's pay.</p>

<p>If you do not normally work on that particular day you should receive
one-fifth of your weekly pay. Even if you may never be rostered to work on a
public holiday you are entitled to one-fifth of your weekly pay as compensation
for the public holiday.</p>

<p>If you do not have normal daily or weekly working hours, under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/si/0475.html">SI 475/1997</a>, an
average of your dayâ€™s pay or the fifth of your weekly pay is calculated over
the 13 weeks you worked before the public holiday.</p>

<p>In all of the above situations your employer may choose to give you paid
time off instead of pay for the public holiday. </p>

<h3>Sick leave on a public holiday</h3>

<p>If you are a full time worker on <a shape="rect" href="sick_leave.html">sick
leave</a> during a public holiday, you are entitled to benefit for the public
holiday you missed, as described above. If you are a part-time worker on sick
leave during a public holiday, you would be entitled to benefit for the public
holiday, provided you had worked for your employer for at least 40 hours in the
previous five-week period - see 'Part-time employees' above.</p>

<p>However, if you have been off work for more than 26 consecutive weeks due to
illness or accident, or for more than 52 weeks due to an occupational accident
and you are absent from work immediately before the public holiday because of
this, you are not entitled to the public holiday.</p>

<h3>Absence from work and public holiday entitlement</h3>

<p>You are entitled to leave for any public holidays that occur while you are
on <a shape="rect" href="maternity_leave.html">maternity leave</a>, <a shape="rect" href="parental_leave.html">parental leave </a>or <a shape="rect" href="adoptive_leave.html">adoptive leave</a>. These rights are set down in law
in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0034/index.html">Maternity
Protection Acts 1994 and 2004</a>, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0030/index.html">Parental
Leave Acts 1998 and 2006,</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0002/index.html">Adoptive
Leave Acts 1995 and 2005</a> respectively.</p>

<p>You are not entitled to public holiday benefits if you have been absent from
work immediately before the public holiday and your absence is:</p>
<ul><li>Over 13 weeks, due to lay off or some other reason and authorised by your
    employer. </li>
  <li>Due to a strike </li>
  <li>After the first 13 weeks of <a shape="rect" href="carers_leave_from_employment.html">carer's leave</a> </li>
</ul><h3>Losing your job</h3>

<p>If your employment finishes during the week ending on the day before a
public holiday and you have worked for your employer for the previous 4 weeks,
you should receive an additional day's pay for the public holiday. This also
applies to part-time employees who have established a right to the public
holiday by working at least 40 hours in the previous 5 weeks. You can read more
about this in 'Further information' below.</p>

<h3>Public holidays falling on a weekend </h3>

<p>Where a public holiday falls on a weekend, you do not have any automatic
legal entitlement to have the next working day off work. This occurred in
2016/2017 when Christmas Day (25 December) and New Year's Day (1 January) fell
on a Sunday. You can find out more about your public holiday entitlement for
your individual working arrangement in this <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/OWT_Guide_Holidays_Public_Holidays.pdf">explanatory
booklet on holidays and public holidays (pdf)</a>. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">

<h3>Termination of employment and public holidays</h3>

<p>In the case of <a href="http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Cases/1999/July/DWT9916.html">Gazboro
Ltd. -v- BATU (DWT9916)</a> the claimants ceased to be employed on 18 December
1998. They claimed an entitlement to be paid in respect of 25 and 26 December.
As the Court interpreted the wording of <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/sec0023.html#sec23">Section
23(2)(a)</a> of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, the week ending at
midnight on 24 December began at midnight on 18 December. Since the claimants
worked for the employer during the 4 weeks preceding that week they were
entitled to an additional day's pay in respect of 25 December. The week ending
on 25 December began at midnight on 19 December. Since the claimants ceased to
be employed on 18 December they had no entitlement under the Act in respect of
26 December. </p>

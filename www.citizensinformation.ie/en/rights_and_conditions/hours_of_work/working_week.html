<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/index.html">Organisation
of Working Time Act 1997</a> states that the maximum average working week for
many employees cannot exceed 48 hours. This does not mean that a working week
can never exceed 48 hours, it is the average that is important. The average may
be calculated in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul><li>Over 4 months for most employees </li>
  <li>Over 6 months for employees working in the security industry, hospitals,
    prisons, gas/electricity, airport/docks, agriculture and employees in
    businesses which have peak periods at certain times of the year such as
    tourism. </li>
  <li>over 12 months where there has been an agreement between the employer and
    the employees to this effect. The agreement between employer and employees
    must be approved by the Labour Court. </li>
</ul><p>The calculation of 48 hours does not include annual leave, sick leave or
maternity/adoptive/parental leave.<br>
The legislation also lays down rules for <a shape="rect" href="night_work.html">night workers,</a> <a shape="rect" href="rest_periods_and_breaks.html">minimum breaks and rest periods.</a> There
are also special provisions in relation to Sunday working – see below.</p>

<h3>Exceptions</h3>

<p>The provisions of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 on working time
and rest periods do not apply to all employees. They do not apply to the
Gardaí, Defence Forces, employees who control their own working hours or
family employees on farms or in private homes. The <a shape="rect" href="../../starting_work_and_changing_job/young_people_at_work/hours_of_work_for_young_people.html">working
hours of young people under the age of 18</a> are regulated by the Protection
of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996.</p>

<p>There are separate regulations governing the working time of trainee doctors
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/si/0494.html">(SI
494/2004)</a>, employees working in mobile road transport activities <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2012/si/36/made/en/print">(SI
36/2012)</a> and employees working at sea.</p>

<p>Employees in certain categories of civil protection services <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/si/0052.html">(SI 52/1998)</a> are
currently exempt from provisions on maximum average working week and statutory
rest breaks/periods. </p>

<h3>Provision of information about working hours</h3>

<p>For many employees the hours of work are specified, for example, in their
contract of employment or in an <a shape="rect" href="../industrial_relations_and_trade_unions/employment_regulation_orders_and_registered_employment_agreements.html">Employment
Regulation Order or Registered Employment AGreement.</a> If the hours of work
are not specified, under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/sec0017.html#sec17">Section
17</a> of the Act, the employer must notify the employee of the starting and
finishing times at least 24 hours before the first day or the day of each week
the employee is required to work. The employer can do this by putting up a
notice in a conspicuous place in the employee's workplace on a day when the
employee is working. If the employee is required to work additional hours the
24 hours' notice must be given in the same way. However, in unforeseen
circumstances such as another employee off work sick, the employer can ask the
employee to work at less than 24 hours' notice.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lcc038">Sunday working</h2>

<p>If you do Sunday work your entitlement to extra pay may be agreed between
you and your employer. Under the Organisation of Working Time Act, if there is
no agreement about your pay, your employer must give you one or more of the
following for Sunday working:</p>
<ul><li>
    <div>
    A reasonable allowance </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    A reasonable pay increase </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    Reasonable paid time off work </div>
  </li>
</ul><p>What is reasonable depends on all the circumstances. It is a matter for
negotiation between you and your employer and, where applicable, your trade
union. Some guidance may be obtained by referring, where possible, to an
agreement applying to comparable employees elsewhere in similar employment.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace
Relations Commission</a> has a <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Workplace_Relations_Services/Info_Cust_Serv/">Code
of Practice for Sunday working in the Retail Trade.</a> </p>

<h3>Overtime</h3>

<p>Overtime is work done outside normal working hours.There is no statutory
obligation on employers to pay employees for work completed in overtime. Many
employers pay employees higher rates of pay for overtime. Your <a href="../contracts_of_employment/contract_of_employment.html">contract of
employment</a> should state if you are required to work overtime and the rates
of pay if you are to be paid for it. Certain sectors of employment were covered
by Employment Regulation Orders and Registered Employment Agreements and may
have higher rates of pay for overtime.</p>

<h3>Workers with no fixed place of work</h3>

<p>Following a decision by the European Court of Justice in 2015, where workers
have no fixed place of work the time they spend travelling between their home
and their first and last customers may be considered to be working time – see
‘Further information below.</p>

<h3>Records</h3>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/si/0473.html">Organisation of
Working Time (Records) (Prescribed Form and Exemptions) Regulations 2001</a>,
your employer is required to keep <a shape="rect" href="employment_working_time_records.html">detailed records of your working
hours</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l23f7d">Further information</h2>

<p>In 2015 the European Court of Justice ruled in case <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2015-09/cp150099en.pdf">C-266/14
(pdf)</a> that where workers do not have a fixed place of work, the time they
spend travelling between their home and their first and last customers each day
counts as working time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2000/act/5/section/8/enacted/en/html">Section
8</a> of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 states that working time does not
include time spent travelling to and from work. Until this legislation is
amended this ECJ ruling may not be enforceable by employees in the private
sector. However under the principle of <em>direct effect</em> it does apply to
the public sector and therefore workers in the public sector who do not have a
fixed place of work may be able to count their travel time between their home
and their first and last customers as working time.</p>

<h2>Information</h2>

<p>Apart from the European Union, the Oireachtas is the only institution in
Ireland with power to make laws for the State. The Oireachtas consists of the
<a shape="rect" href="../../the_president/president_introduction_to_the_president_of_ireland.html">President</a>,
and the 2 Houses of the Oireachtas: <a shape="rect" href="dail_eireann.html">Dáil Eireann</a> and <a shape="rect" href="the_seanad.html">Seanad Eireann</a>.</p>

<p>A new law starts life as a <em>Bill</em>. A Bill is a proposal for
legislation. Apart from <a shape="rect" href="private_members_bills.html">Private Members' Bills</a>, Bills are usually
initiated by the Government. </p>

<p>A Bill may be commenced in either the Dáil or the Seanad but it must be
passed by both Houses to become law. Usually, Bills are commenced in Dáil
Eireann. </p>

<p>Before it is introduced to the Dáil, the contents of the Bill are approved
by the Government. Usually there will be a process of consultation with <a shape="rect" href="../../government_departments/departments_of_state.html">government
departments</a> and groups likely to be affected by the Bill. (Examples of
these groups are voluntary organisations, lobby groups or members of the
public.)</p>

<p>Sometimes, the Government will publish a <em>Green Paper.</em> A Green Paper
is a discussion document setting out ideas and inviting comment and views from
individuals and relevant organisations.</p>

<p>The Bill is then put before the Dáil for a general debate on the principles
of the Bill. Members of the Dáil may make suggestions for amendments and
additions to the Bill. </p>

<p>The Bill is then sent to committees to be examined section by section. After
the committee stage, more amendments may be made to the Bill. This is known as
the report stage.</p>

<p>The final stage in the process is a debate in the Dáil, confined to the
contents of the Bill. The members of the Dáil will then vote on whether to
pass the Bill. </p>

<p>The Bill will then be sent down to the Seanad to go through the entire
process of debate and committee examination again. The Seanad has 90 days (or
any longer period agreed by both Houses) to consider the Bill and do one of the
following:</p>
<ul><li>Pass the Bill without any amendment or</li>
  <li>Reject the Bill completely or</li>
  <li>Return the Bill to the Dáil with amendments</li>
</ul><p>If the Seanad rejects the Bill or returns it to the Dáil with amendments
that the Dáil does not accept, the Bill will lapse after 180 days. The Dáil
may, within those 180 days, pass a resolution declaring that the Bill is deemed
to have been passed by both Houses. This provision means that the Seanad cannot
generally stop the Dáil from introducing legislation – it can only cause
delays. </p>

<p><em>Money Bills</em> are Bills that relate to taxation or relate to spending
by the Government. The Seanad has only 21 days to consider these Bills. </p>

<p>Once the Bill has been passed by both Houses, the Taoiseach presents a copy
of the Bill to the President for signature. Once the President has signed the
Bill it becomes an <em>Act</em> and has legal force. You can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/">view all Irish legislation 1922 to date
here</a>.</p>

<p>When the Bill comes to the President for signature, they do have an
important power. If they consider that the new Bill may conflict with the <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Constitution</a>,
they may, after consultation with the <a shape="rect" href="../../the_president/council_of_state.html">Council of State</a>, refer
the question of whether or not the Bill is constitutional to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court must then decide whether or not the Bill is constitutional
before it can be made law.</p>

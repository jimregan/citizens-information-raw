    national language, culture, literature, art, education, law and
  medicine.</li>
  <li>Agricultural panel. This includes people involved in agriculture and
    fisheries.</li>
  <li>Labour panel. This includes people involved in either organised or
    unorganised labour</li>
  <li>Industrial and Commercial panel. This includes people involved in
    industry and commerce, including banking, finance, accountancy, engineering
    and architecture.</li>
  <li>Administrative panel. This includes people involved in public
    administration and social services, including voluntary social
  services.</li>
</ul><p>Those five panels are then each divided into two panels; the Oireachtas

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>In order to be nominated to a panel of candidates, you must be <a shape="rect" href="the_seanad.html">eligible to become a Senator</a>. To be
placed on an Oireachtas sub-panel, you must be nominated by any four members of
the DÃ¡il and Seanad. Each TD and Senator can nominate one person only to any
Oireachtas sub-panel. </p>

<p>To be placed on a Nominating Bodies sub-panel, you must be nominated by one
of the bodies registered. The Clerk of the Seanad keeps a register of bodies
that can nominate candidates. These bodies are usually non-profit making
organisations that represent the interests of one of the panels. A body cannot
be registered for more than one panel. </p>

<p>Each registered nominating body will nominate a fixed number of candidates
for its panel.</p>

<p>The Register of Nominating Bodies is reviewed in February each year. Any
body that wants to be registered or amend its details on the register or be
removed from the register must complete an application form and submit it to
the Seanad Returning Officer before 12 noon on 14 February (see 'Where to
apply' below).</p>

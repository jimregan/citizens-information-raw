<p>Dáil Éireann is one of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the national
parliament. Dáil Éireann is located in Dublin.</p>

<p>The Dáil consists of members of the Dáil or TDs – Teachta Dála. They
are also known as Deputies. TDs are elected directly to the Dáil in a <a shape="rect" href="../../elections_and_referenda/national_elections/the_general_election.html">general
election</a>. If a vacancy occurs at the Dáil, the seat will be filled by a <a shape="rect" href="../../elections_and_referenda/national_elections/by_elections_in_ireland.html">bye-election</a>.
There is a <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0">list of
current TDs, grouped alphabetically by name or by constituency</a>. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Constitution</a>
states that the number of TDs cannot be more than one for every 20,000 of the
population and cannot be less than one for every 30,000. There are currently
158 TDs. </p>

<p>The country is divided into 40 constituencies and every constituency must
elect at least three members to the Dáil. As far as possible, the ratio of
population to TD must be equal in each constituency. </p>

<p>The constituencies must be revised at least once every 12 years, although in
practice they are revised after the census is published every 5 years. An
independent <a href="http://www.constituency-commission.ie/index.htm">Constituency
Commission</a> is appointed to draw up a revised scheme of constituencies which
is then given effect by an Act of the Oireachtas.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="work_of_a_td.html">TDs represent and work</a> on
behalf of the electors in their constituency. </p>

<p>The maximum life of the Dáil is 5 years, although at any time the Taoiseach
may advise the President to <a shape="rect" href="dissolution_of_the_dail.html">dissolve the Dáil</a>. </p>

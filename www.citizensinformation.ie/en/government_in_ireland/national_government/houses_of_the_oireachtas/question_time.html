<h2>Information</h2>

<p>Dáil Éireann allocates a certain amount of time on Tuesdays, Wednesdays
and Thursdays during which deputies (TDs) may ask questions of members of the
Government relating to public affairs connected with their departments or on
matters of administration for whch they are officially responsible.</p>

<p>The questions are referred to as parliamentary questions or PQs.</p>

<p>The Taoiseach answers questions on Tuesdays in respect of matters relating
to the administration of his own department.</p>

<p>Other members of the Government reply to questions on an agreed rota basis.
The rota repeats itself every 5 weeks or so, giving the opportunity to Deputies
to question each minister on a regular basis. </p>

<p>Currently, the Minister for Health sends questions referring to the
executive function of the health service <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/about/PersonalPQ/">to the HSE for reply</a>. </p>

<p>TDs are limited to asking each minister 2 oral questions. Every day, 5 oral
questions are given priority. The priority questions are shared between the
parties according to party strength. </p>

<p>As well as oral questions in question time, TDs can submit written questions
seeking a written answer. There is no limit to the amount of written questions
that a TD can ask the Government. </p>

<p>The member of the Government must be given 3 days' notice for priority oral
questions and 4 days' notice for other questions. Sometimes a very urgent
matter of public importance will suddenly arise. The <a shape="rect" href="ceann_comhairle.html">Ceann Comhairle</a> may accept questions about an
urgent issue at very short notice. These questions are called "private notice"
questions and are taken at the end of question time.</p>

<p>The Oireachtas publishes the replies to parliamentary questions daily as
part of the <a href="http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/">Dáil Debates</a>. </p>

<p>Dáil debates are published incrementally throughout a sitting day. All
proceedings before 7pm are published before midnight, the remainder being added
the following day.</p>

<p>Seanad debates are published incrementally on a same day or next day
basis.</p>

<p>Replies to questions tabled by members for written response by ministers are
published at the end of each day's Dáil proceedings.</p>

<p>The Official Report of each committee meeting is published within a week at
latest, but generally within 2 to 3 working days.</p>

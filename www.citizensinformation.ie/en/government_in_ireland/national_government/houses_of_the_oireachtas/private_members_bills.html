<h2>Information</h2>

<p>All proposals for new laws (in other words, Acts of the Oireachtas) start
life as Bills. Proposals for laws that apply to the general public are called
<em>Public Bills</em> which include Government Bills and Private Members’
Bills. Proposals for laws that are promoted by corporate entities or
individuals for their own purposes are called <em>Private Bills</em>. In
general, Private Bills are very rare.</p>

<p>A Private Member's Bill is a Public Bill that can be initiated by any member
of either of the houses of the Oireachtas (that is, <a shape="rect" href="dail_eireann.html">the Dáil</a> or <a shape="rect" href="the_seanad.html">Seanad</a>), regardless of their political affiliation.
The Private Member's Bill <span>cannot</span> be started by any <a shape="rect" href="../the_irish_government/composition_of_the_government.html">member of the
Government</a>, Minister of State, the <a shape="rect" href="../the_irish_government/the_attorney_general.html">Attorney General</a>
or leader of the House in the Seanad.</p>

<p>Like Government <a shape="rect" href="legislation.html">legislation</a> the
Private Member's Bill <span>must be passed</span> by both Houses of the
Oireachtas. In practice, the Government opposes Private Members' Bills so it is
very rare that a Bill will survive to become legislation. </p>

<p>Sometimes, Private Members' Bills are initiated by members of the Oireachtas
simply to draw attention to an issue or to focus public debate on a gap in the
law. </p>

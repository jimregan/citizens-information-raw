<p>The purpose of registering a political party in the Register of Political
Parties is that candidates at elections who are members of registered parties
may add their parties' name to their own names on the ballot paper. If the
party that you belong to is not included on the Register, you will be described
as a non-party candidate on the ballot paper. The Registrar and the actual
Register of Political Parties are based in the Houses of the Oireachtas,
Dublin. The Registrar is the Clerk of the Dáil. </p>

<p>Under Section 25 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0023/index.html">Electoral
Act, 1992,</a> as substituted by <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0038/sec0011.html">Section
11 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2001</a>, you can apply to the Registrar
of Political Parties in order to register your own political party in any of
the following elections in Ireland: </p>
<ul><li>Dáil elections </li>
  <li>European elections </li>
  <li>Local elections</li>
</ul></div>

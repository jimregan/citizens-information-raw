<h2>Information</h2>

<p>The main function of Seanad Éireann is in relation to <a shape="rect" href="legislation.html">legislation</a>. A Bill may start life in either the
Dáil or the Seanad. In practice, the vast majority of Bills originate from the
Government and are passed by the Dáil first. They are then sent to the Seanad
for debate and consideration. Within 90 days, the Seanad may propose
amendments, reject or pass a Bill. The Dáil has the power to over-ride the
Seanad's rejection of a Bill. </p>

<p>The Seanad's powers in relation to Bills for Government spending (Money
Bills) are very restricted. These Bills cannot start life in the Seanad, they
must come from the Dáil. The Seanad has only 21 days to consider a Money Bill
and cannot make amendments to it. </p>

<p>The Seanad has other functions, which it shares with the Dáil, such as the
removal from office of the <a shape="rect" href="../../the_president/inauguration_and_removal_of_the_president.html">President</a>
or a judge of the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/supreme_court.html">Supreme Court</a>, declaring a
state of emergency and annulling <a shape="rect" href="../../government_departments/administration_of_government_departments.html">statutory
instruments</a>. </p>

<p>In recent years, parliamentary committees have become an important part of
the work of the Seanad. Joint Committees involve both Seanad and Dáil members
sitting and voting together on particular issues.</p>

<p>Seanad Éireann normally meets on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Senators are
also involved in drafting amendments to Bills and examining proposals for new
legislation. They contribute to debates on Bills and other important matters.
They vote on issues in the House.</p>

<p>Senators are not officially separated into political parties. However, they
usually divide into groups supporting and opposing Government business when
voting on issues.</p>

<p>Senators have certain <a shape="rect" href="privileges_of_tds_and_senators.html">privileges</a> as members of the
Oireachtas. They may be disciplined by the House for breach of procedure or
abuse of privilege.</p>

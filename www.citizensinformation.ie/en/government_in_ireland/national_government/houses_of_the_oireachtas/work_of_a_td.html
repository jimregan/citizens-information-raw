<h2>Information</h2>

<p>Members of Dáil Eireann are elected by a <a shape="rect" href="../../elections_and_referenda/national_elections/the_general_election.html">general
election</a>. A TD (Teachta Dála) can be a member of a Government party, the
Opposition or may sit as an independent TD. A TD represents everyone who is
entitled to vote within their constituency. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0">A list of
TDs, grouped alphabetically with their postal addresses, is available
here</a>.</p>

<p>A TD's work at <a shape="rect" href="dail_eireann.html">Dáil Eireann</a>
involves meeting in plenary session on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and the
first Friday in each month. A typical day's work includes researching and
preparing speeches for debates on social, economic, financial and budgetary
issues. Debates in the Dáil are chaired by the <a shape="rect" href="ceann_comhairle.html">Ceann Comhairle</a>. View the <a href="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/yearlist?readform&amp;chamber=dail">official
reports of all Dáil debates</a> from 1919. </p>

<p>TDs may also draft amendments to and examine proposals for new <a shape="rect" href="legislation.html">legislation</a>. TDs contribute to debates
about new legislation and other important matters, they vote on issues in the
House, they attend <a shape="rect" href="question_time.html">Question Time</a>,
they participate in Committee work and they make written or oral
representations to ministers or government departments on behalf of their
constituencies.</p>

<p>There is a Committee system at Dáil Eireann. Specialist Committees advise
the Dáil on a broad range of legislative, social, economic and financial
business. Committees also examine Government expenditure. Joint Committees are
committees from both Dáil Eireann and the <a shape="rect" href="the_seanad.html">Seanad</a> sitting and voting together. A TD will often
be a member of more than one Committee. View a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/oireachtasbusiness/committees_list/#d.en.2547">list
and membership of all parliamentary committees</a> here.</p>

<p>As well as work at the Dáil and on Committees, TDs work within their own
constituencies. They hold regular advice clinics throughout their
constituencies so that voters can meet them personally. Often they provide
assistance to constituents with a family/personal problem relating to a
government department. </p>

<p>If a TD breaches the rules of procedure or the <em>Standing Orders</em> at
the Dáil, they may be disciplined. In February 2002, the members of the Dáil
adopted a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/press/codeofconduct.htm">Code
of Conduct</a> to ensure that their actions and decisions are taken in the best
interests of the public. </p>

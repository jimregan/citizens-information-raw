<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>An investigatory inquiry is usually set up when something major of
significant public importance has gone wrong; often because someone has done
wrong, acted unlawfully or failed to act. Its purpose is to find out the facts
in relation to the particular matter of public concern, which has been
identified by its terms of reference.</p>

<p>As well as investigating the matter, the inquiry may make recommendations to
prevent it happening again. It does not <a href="../standards_and_accountability/rights_tribunals.html">settle legal
rights</a> or impose penalties on individuals.</p>

<p>Irish law makes provision for a number of different types of investigatory
inquiry. These range from special inquiries established to investigate a
particular event or series of events, such as tribunals of inquiry, to other
inquiries such as planning inquiries. Not all inquiries are established using
legislation, that is, on a statutory basis.</p>

<p>The findings of a particular inquiry may lead to some other form of inquiry
being set up.</p>

<h3>Tribunals of inquiry</h3>

<p>Tribunals of inquiry are not permanent tribunals. Instead, they are set up
with powers to investigate specific matters. They are usually chaired by judges
or senior lawyers. At the end of the investigation, the tribunal submits a
report to the Oireachtas, which may contain recommendations.</p>

<p>The duration and costs of tribunals of inquiry have been an issue. The
Comptroller and Auditor General published a <a href="http://www.audgen.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=1133&amp;CatID=5&amp;StartDate=1+January+2015">Special
Report into Tribunals of Inquiry</a> in December 2008.</p>

<p>More information can be found in our document on <a href="tribunals_of_inquiry.html">tribunals of inquiry</a>.</p>

<h3>Commissions of investigation</h3>

<p>Commissions of investigation are less expensive and speedier method of
investigating matters than a tribunal of inquiry. It is set up by government
order which must be approved by the Dáil and Seanad. The terms of reference
are set by the Government or by an individual Minister. The commission makes a
final report on its findings to a specified Minister.</p>

<p>There is more information in our document on <a href="commissions_of_investigation.html">commissions of
investigation</a>.</p>

<h3>Sectoral investigations</h3>

<p>There is a range of specialised legislation regulating particular sectors,
such as the Companies Act 1990, which provide for investigations. The following
are some examples:</p>
<ul><li>Part 2 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0033/index.html">Companies
    Act 1990</a> (Part 13 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0038/index.html">Companies
    Act 2014</a> when it is commenced) provides for the appointment of
    inspectors to <a href="http://www.odce.ie/en-gb/functions/enforcement.aspx">investigate the
    affairs of a company</a>, in particular situations.</li>
  <li>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/si/0258.html">European Union
    (Railway Safety) (Reporting and Investigation of Serious Accidents,
    Accidents and Incidents) Regulations 2014</a> the <a href="http://www.raiu.ie/">Railway Accident Investigation Unit (RAIU)</a>
    investigates railway accidents and incidents.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0014/index.html">Merchant
    Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000</a> and the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/si/0276.html">European
    Communities (Merchant Shipping) (Investigation of Accidents) Regulations
    2011</a> provide for the investigation by the <a href="http://www.mcib.ie/">Marine Casualty Investigation Board (MCIB)</a>
    into marine casualties that take place in Irish waters or involve Irish
    registered vessels.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.aaiu.ie/">Air Accident Investigation Unit
    (AAIU)</a> investigates aircraft accidents and incidents that occur within
    the State under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/si/0460.html">Air Navigation
    (Notification and Investigation of Accidents, Serious Incidents and
    Incidents) Regulations 2009</a>.</li>
</ul><p>Investigations are also carried out by other bodies, such as, the <a href="http://www.audgen.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=-1&amp;CatID=5&amp;UserLang=EN&amp;m=13">Office
of the Comptroller and Auditor-General</a> and the <a href="http://www.ombudsman.gov.ie/en/Publications/Investigation-Reports/">Office
of the Ombudsman</a>.</p>

<h3>Parliamentary inquiries</h3>

<p>The Oireachtas has a <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/oireachtasbusiness/committees_list/www.oireachtas/committees/fact-sheets/">specialised
system of committees</a> which advises on a wide range of legislative, social,
economic and financial business. On an ongoing basis, committees publish <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/oireachtasbusiness/committees_list/www.oireachtas/committees/committee-reports/">reports
and results of their investigations</a>. A few special Oireachtas inquiries
have also been held, such as the <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/oireachtasbusiness/committees_list/www.oireachtas/committees/parliamentaryinquiries/">Parliamentary
inquiry into D.I.R.T.</a> in 1999, but in general they have faced legal
challenges.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/act/pub/0033/index.html">Houses of
the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013</a>, which came
into effect in September 2013, provides for the holding of inquiries into
matters of public importance by the Oireachtas. Inquiries can be concerned with
systems, practices, procedures, policies and the implementation of policy, and
the effectiveness of legislative and regulatory systems.</p>

<p>Such inquiries may not make any findings that adversely affect the good name
of someone who is not:</p>
<ul><li>A member of the Dáil or Seanad, or</li>
  <li>An officeholder or</li>
  <li>Someone who is directly accountable to the Oireachtas</li>
</ul><p>A <a href="http://www.refcom.ie/en/Past-Referendums/Judges'-Remuneration-and-Houses-of-the-Oireachtas-Inquiries-2011/">proposed
Constitutional amendment</a> to give such powers to the Oireachtas was rejected
by the people in 2011.</p>

<p>In November 2014, a <a href="http://inquiries.oireachtas.ie/banking/">Committee of Inquiry into the
Banking Crisis</a> was established under the 2013 Act. The purpose of the
Inquiry is to inquire into the reasons Ireland experienced a systemic banking
crisis.</p>

<h3>Statutory and non-statutory inquiries</h3>

<p>Not all inquiries are set up on a statutory basis. In 2000 the Minister for
Health and Children established the <a href="http://health.gov.ie/blog/press-release/minister-martin-announces-organ-inquiry/">Dunne
Post Mortem Inquiry</a> and in 2012 commissioned a report from Professor Walsh,
independent researcher, on the <a href="http://health.gov.ie/blog/publications/report-on-symphysiotomy-in-ireland-1944-1984-professor-oonagh-walsh/">practice
of symphysiotomy</a> in Ireland.</p>

<p>Sometimes a preliminary inquiry may be held in order to make the work of the
main inquiry easier. The <a href="http://www.childabusecommission.ie/about/index.html">Commission to
Inquire into Child Abuse</a> was initially established on an administrative
basis in 1999 before being established on a statutory basis in 2000 under the
<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0007/index.html">Commission
to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000</a>.</p>

<p>Further information on inquiries and investigations is available in the Law
Reform Commission’s 2003 <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/consultation%20papers/cpPublicInquiries.pdf">Consultation
Paper on Public Inquiries (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l7e5a0">Redress</h2>

<p>Following on from an inquiry, often a compensation tribunal or scheme has
been set up to compensate the victims of the episode or conduct which was under
investigation at the inquiry. The following are examples of such compensation
schemes:</p>
<ul><li>The <a href="http://www.hepccomptrib.com/">Hepatitis Compensation
    Tribunal</a> was set up in 1995. It provides compensation to those infected
    with Hepatitis C or HIV as a result of the use of Human Immunoglobulin
    Anti-D or as a result of the receipt of a blood transfusion or blood
    product within the State.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.rirb.ie/">Residential Institutions Redress
    Board</a> was established in 2002. It was set up to compensate those who,
    as children, were abused while resident in industrial schools,
    reformatories and other institutions subject to State regulation or
    inspection.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.caranua.ie/">Caranua</a> was established in 2013
    under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0035/index.html">Residential
    Institutions Statutory Fund Act 2012</a> to help those who experienced
    abuse in residential institutions and have received settlements through the
    Residential Institutions Redress Board or the courts.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.payment-scheme.gov.ie/Symphyisotomy/Symphyisotomy.nsf/page/index-en">Symphysiotomy
    Payment Scheme</a> was set up in 2014 to provide ex-gratia payments to
    women who underwent a surgical symphysiotomy or a pubiotomy in any hospital
    in the State between 1940 and 1990.</li>

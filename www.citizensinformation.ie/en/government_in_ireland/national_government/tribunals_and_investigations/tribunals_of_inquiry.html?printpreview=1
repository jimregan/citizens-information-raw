<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>Ireland's Parliament (Oireachtas) has the power to establish tribunals of
inquiry to investigate certain matters of public importance. If the Government
considers that a particular issue of controversy or dispute is of such public
importance that a public inquiry is necessary, it can propose legislation to
set up a tribunal of inquiry.</p>

<p>These tribunals are not permanent tribunals. Instead, they are set up with
powers to investigate specific matters. They are usually chaired by judges or
senior lawyers. </p>

<p>At the end of the investigation, the tribunal submits a report to the
Oireachtas, which may contain recommendations. </p>

<p>Some of the tribunals that have been set up in include:</p>
<ul><li>The Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry, 1994. This
    tribunal was set up to investigate alleged irregularities in the way the
    beef industry in Ireland was being run. </li>
  <li>The Tribunal of Inquiry into the Blood Transfusion Service Board, 1997.
    This tribunal was set up to investigate the infection of large numbers of
    people in the 1970s and 1980s with contaminated blood products. </li>
  <li>The Tribunal of Inquiry into Payments to Politicians (Dunnes Stores),
    1997. This tribunal was set up to investigate the payment of moneys to
    politicians. </li>
  <li>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.flood-tribunal.ie/asp/index.asp">Mahon Tribunal</a>
    (Formerly known as the 'Flood Tribunal'). This tribunal was set up to
    investigate payments to politicians in the context of planning decisions.
  </li>
  <li>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.moriarty-tribunal.ie/">Moriarty
    Tribunal</a>. This tribunal was set up to investigate into payments to
    politicians, including former Taoiseach Charles Haughey. </li>
  <li>The Lindsay Tribunal. This tribunal was set up to inquire into the
    infection with HIV and Hepatitis C of persons with haemophilia. </li>
  <li>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.childabusecommission.ie">Laffoy
    Commission</a>. This tribunal was set up to examine claims of child abuse
    within the State's industrial schools. </li>
  <li>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.morristribunal.ie/">Morris
    Tribunal</a>. This tribunal was set up to investigate complaints concerning
    some Gardaí of the Donegal division. </li>
</ul><h3>Powers of tribunals of inquiry</h3>

<p>To carry out the investigation, the tribunal is given certain powers,
including the power to hold public or private hearings. The Oireachtas may
decide that any tribunal that it sets up shall be invested with the powers set
out in the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 to 2004.</p>

<p>This Act provides that a tribunal can make orders to force witnesses to
attend and give evidence. It also allows the tribunal to apply to the <a href="../../../justice/courts_system/high_court.html">High Court</a> if a
person refuses to give evidence or is in contempt of the tribunal.</p>

<p>The High Court may order a witness to give evidence. If he or she continues
to fail to co-operate with the tribunal, the High Court may hold the witness in
contempt of court and have the witness imprisoned until he or she has
co-operated with the tribunal. It is also a criminal offence to refuse to give
evidence or to co-operate with a tribunal.</p>

<p>If the tribunal considers that there is sufficient reason to do so, it can
order any person to pay the costs of another person appearing before the
tribunal or the costs of the tribunal itself. This may happen if a person fails
to co-operate with the tribunal or gives false or misleading evidence.</p>

<p>At the end of the tribunal's investigation, it will submit a report to the
Oireachtas setting out the findings it has made. In many cases, a tribunal of
inquiry will also be given the power to make recommendations with a view to
preventing the same problem happening again. These recommendations may include
suggestions for law reform.</p>

<p>The tribunal's function is purely fact-finding and investigative. Although
it may make recommendations, it does not make a binding judgement on the rights
of individuals. It simply states, in its report, the results of its
investigations and the findings of fact it has made.</p>

<p>Any statement or admission made at a tribunal cannot be used in evidence
against a person in criminal proceedings. However, sometimes the findings of
tribunals can give rise to an investigation leading to independent criminal or
civil proceedings.</p>

<p>This means that strict procedures are usually applied in the course of the
tribunals. Interested parties usually have legal representation, including a
solicitor, a junior counsel and a senior counsel. Witnesses are usually
cross-examined.</p>

<h3>Law Reform Commission report</h3>

<p>In May 2005, the Law Reform Commission published a <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/Reports/rPublicInquiries.pdf">Report
on Public Inquiries Including Tribunals of Inquiry (pdf).</a> This Report
followed on from a Consultation Paper originally published by the Law Reform
Commission in 2003. The Report came in the wake of the establishment of
numerous tribunals. These tribunals have examined various matters, including
major disasters involving loss of life, and allegations of wrongdoing in land
development and the planning process.</p>

<p>The Report's recommendations include procedural changes concerning the
selection of an appropriate type of inquiry, drafting appropriate terms of
reference, the rights of individuals and organisations to be heard and
represented and the awarding of legal costs. </p>

<h3>Tribunals of inquiry and costs</h3>

<p>The cost of tribunals of inquiry, including the cost of legal representation
of all interested parties, is usually paid by the State.</p>

<p>Significant costs have arisen in recent years with regard to tribunals. The
Comptroller and Auditor General published a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.audgen.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=1134&amp;CatID=5&amp;StartDate=1+January+2011">Special
Report into Tribunals of Inquiry (pdf)</a> in December 2008. The report gives
an estimate of the costs involved in the more recent Mahon, Moriarty and Morris
tribunals.</p>

<h3>Proposed legislation</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2005/3305/b3305d.pdf">Tribunals
of Inquiry Bill 2005 (pdf)</a> aims to consolidate and modernise the law
regarding Tribunals of Inquiry. </p>

<p>The Bill contains provisons which: </p>
<ul><li>Clarify the process for setting and amending terms of reference of a
    tribunal </li>
  <li>Require a tribunal, within three months of its establishment, to produce
    a statement of estimated costs and duration of the tribunal. This statement
    must be subsequently amended after significant developments </li>
  <li>Enable the Government for stated reasons and following a resolution of
    both Houses of the Oireachtas to dissolve a tribunal </li>
  <li>Governing the taking of evidence, including a provision to end the costly
    practice of orally <em>reading-in</em> of evidence already available in
    written form and not disputed </li>
  <li>Clarify the situation with regard to the granting of legal representation
    before a tribunal </li>
  <li>Enable the responsible Minister will be able to request an interim report
    on the general progress of an inquiry, or of a particular aspect of an
    inquiry, from the tribunal </li>
  <li>Allow tribunal reports to be admissible in civil cases. This section
    provides that the facts in a report or the opinions expressed therein are
    uncontested </li>
  <li>Require the Minister for Justice and Equality, with the consent of the
    Minister for Finance, to make regulations which will set out maximum
    amounts of legal fees recoverable from the State </li>
  <li>Require the Taxing Master of the High Court, when adjudicating on
    applications for costs in respect of third parties, not to exceed the
    amounts set out in the regulations. </li>
</ul></div>

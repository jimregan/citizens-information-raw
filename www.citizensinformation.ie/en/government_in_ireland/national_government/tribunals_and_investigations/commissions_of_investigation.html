<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0023/index.html">Commissions
of Investigation Act 2004</a> provides for the establishment of commissions of
investigation which can investigate matters of significant public concern. They
are a less expensive and speedier method of investigating matters than a <a href="tribunals_of_inquiry.html">tribunal of inquiry</a>. In certain
circumstances, a tribunal of inquiry may be set up after a commission has
reported.</p>

<p>The Act provides that a commission is set up by government order – this
must be approved by the Dail and Seanad. The terms of reference are set by the
Government or by an individual Minister. These terms must be accompanied by
statements setting out the likely duration and cost of an investigation.</p>

<p>Commissions of investigation that have been set up include:</p>
<ul><li>Commission of Investigation into Dublin and Monaghan Bombings (2005): Set
    up to investigate the 1974 bombings</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.dacoi.ie/index.html">Commission of Investigation into
    the Dublin Archdiocese</a> (2006): Investigation into the handling of
    complaints of child sexual abuse involving Catholic priests in or attached
    to the Archdiocese of Dublin</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.bankinginquiry.gov.ie/Home.aspx">Commission of
    Investigation into the Banking Sector in Ireland</a> (2010): An
    investigation into the main causes of the banking crisis</li>
</ul><h3>Powers of commissions</h3>

<p>Commissions are required to seek the voluntary co-operation of witnesses but
have powers to compel people to give evidence if necessary. They also have
powers to search premises and take documents.</p>

<p>In general, evidence is given in private. It is intended that commissions
should be less adversarial than tribunals. The legal representatives of other
parties will be present only if the commission is satisfied that their presence
is necessary in the interests of the investigation and fair procedures.
Witnesses may only be cross-examined if the commission agrees.</p>

<p>The Act provides for guidelines to be prepared by the relevant Minister in
respect of witnesses’ legal costs. A person who obstructs the commission or
does not co-operate may be held liable for the additional costs resulting from
this.</p>

<h3>Reports</h3>

<p>A commission makes a final report on its findings to a specified Minister.
The Minister may request interim reports on the general progress of a
commission's investigation or on a particular aspect of the investigation.</p>

<p>The Minister is obliged to publish the commission’s final report unless
the Minister considers that such publication might prejudice any criminal
proceedings that are in progress. In such a case, the Minister may apply to the
High Court for directions.</p>

<p>There are provisions for people named in the report to challenge the
findings in relation to them.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The parliamentary public petitions system allows members of the public raise
issues of general public interest or concern or issues of public policy with
the Houses of the Oireachtas (parliament). The subject of a petition must
relate to a matter on which the Houses of the Oireachtas have the power to
act.</p>

<p>Only one signature is needed to submit a petition. A decision on a petition
is made by the Joint Committee on Public Petitions.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you are submitting a petition it must relate to a matter on which the
Houses of the Oireachtas have the power to act and the petition must be in the
proper form. It must not:</p>
<ul><li>Relate to a case where court proceedings have been initiated and the case
    is being or will be heard before a jury</li>
  <li>Contain the name or names of individuals</li>
  <li>Contain language which is offensive or defamatory</li>
  <li>Be frivolous, vexatious or otherwise constitute an abuse of the petitions
    system</li>
  <li>Be the same as or substantially similar to a petition brought by you, or
    on behalf of you, during the current lifetime of the Dáil and which was
    closed by agreement of the Joint Committee</li>
</ul><p>You should be able to demonstrate that you have already taken steps to
resolve the issue, for example, through raising it with the Ombudsman or
directly with the relevant government department.</p>

<p>The Joint Committee will not consider a complaint which has been the subject
of a decision by an Ombudsman or some regulatory or redress body.</p>

<h3>Joint Committee on Public Petitions</h3>

<p>You submit your petition to the <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/oireachtasbusiness/committees_list/p-committee/">Joint
Committee on Public Petitions</a> which is a parliamentary committee consisting
of TDs and Senators. The Joint Committee must first decide whether your
petition is compliant with <a href="http://petitions.oireachtas.ie/online_petitions.nsf/Standing%20Orders%20(English).pdf">Dáil
and Seanad standing orders (pdf)</a>. If it is considered to be compliant, it
will then consider your petition.</p>

<p>When considering your petition the Joint Committee may invite you to appear
before it. It may also seek oral or written evidence from the relevant
government department, as well as other appropriate bodies or stakeholders. It
may also:</p>
<ul><li>Refer your petition to some other parliamentary committee for further
    consideration and a report</li>
  <li>Refer your petition to an ombudsman or some regulatory or redress
  body</li>
</ul><p>Following its considerations, the Joint Committee makes a decision on what
further action it will take. This action can include reporting to the <a href="../houses_of_the_oireachtas/dail_eireann.html">Dáil</a> with
recommendations, including a request that the report be debated by the
Dáil.</p>

<p>If the Joint Committee decides that no further action is required your
petition will be closed. You will be notified of the Joint Committee’s
considerations and its final decision.</p>

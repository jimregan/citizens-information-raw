<p>Under Article 15 of the <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Constitution
of Ireland</a>, the <a shape="rect" href="../houses_of_the_oireachtas/">Oireachtas</a> must not enact a law which
is incompatible with the Constitution. Also, if a law or part of a law is
incompatible with the Constitution, the law or part of it is invalid. A law
passed by the Oireachtas is presumed to be constitutional until it is proven
not to be. <br></p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Presidential power </h3>

<p>Legislation starts life as a Bill which is passed by both Houses of the
Oireachtas. <a shape="rect" href="../../the_president/president_of_ireland_and_legislation.html">Every Bill
must be signed by the Irish President</a> before it can become law. As soon as
a Bill has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, it is presented to the
President for signature.</p>

<p>Before signing the Bill, the President has the power under Article 26 of the
Constitution to refer the bill to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/supreme_court.html">Supreme Court</a> when there
is doubt as to whether it is constitutional. The President must first consult
with the Council of State but the decision to refer the Bill is the President's
alone.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court must decide whether or not the Bill conflicts with the
Constitution. If the Supreme Court holds that the Bill is unconstitutional, the
President cannot sign it into law. Under Article 34 of the Constitution, if a
Bill has been referred by the President and the Supreme Court decides that the
Bill is compatible with the Constitution, the constitutionality of this
legislation cannot be challenged subsequently.</p>

<h3>Judicial proceedings </h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/high_court.html">High
Court</a> has the power or <em>jurisdiction</em> to cancel any law or part of
any law that is repugnant to the Constitution. This means that if you believe
that a law breaches the Constitution or your fundamental rights, you may bring
proceedings in the High Court. The constitutionality of an Act that has not yet
commenced may be challenged where an order commencing it could be made at any
time. Notice of the proceedings must be served on the <a shape="rect" href="../the_irish_government/the_attorney_general.html">Attorney
General</a>.</p>

<p>In order to challenge the constitutionality of legislation, you must show
that you have "sufficient interest" in the proceedings, that is, that the
legislation affects you in some real way. You must also show that you have an
arguable case, that is, that your case has grounds. </p>

<p>The High Court will examine the legislation in question and decide whether
or not it conflicts with the Constitution. If it decides that the legislation
does conflict with the Constitution, it may annul or cancel the law or the part
of it that is unconstitutional. </p>

<p>The High Courtâ€™s decision may be appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>If you wish to begin judicial proceedings, you should contact a <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a> who will
in turn brief a barrister to draft the papers for the case. It is also possible
for you to represent yourself if you wish to keep your legal costs down.</p>

<p>There is no fixed rate of charges for legal fees so you should obtain some
quotes before deciding on legal representation. Your solicitor must advise you
in writing of the fees you will be charged for their services. If it is not
possible to give you a definite sum, they must estimate a sum or at the very
least describe the basis upon which charges or fees will be calculated. </p>

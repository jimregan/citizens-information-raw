<p>The main duty of the Irish Ombudsman is to investigate complaints made by
members of the public about how they have been treated by public bodies in
Ireland. The Ombudsman can examine decisions, refusals to take action and
administrative procedures of public bodies. </p>

<p>The Irish Ombudsman is appointed by the <a shape="rect" href="../../the_president/president_introduction_to_the_president_of_ireland.html">Irish
President</a> following nomination by both Houses of the Oireachtas (the Irish
parliament). You can find <a shape="rect" href="https://www.ombudsman.gov.ie/en/About-Us/">information on the current
Ombudsman here</a>.</p>

<p>The Ombudsman can demand any information, document or file from the body
complained of.</p>

<p>The Ombudsman is not a political office and he or she must remain
independent in the performance of the functions of Ombudsman. </p>

<p>The Ombudsman stays in office for 6 years. He or she may resign or may be
removed from office because of misbehaviour, incapacity or bankruptcy. He or
she must retire at the age of 67 years. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You can make a complaint if you are unhappy with the service provided by any
of the following bodies:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="../../government_departments/administration_of_government_departments.html">Government
    departments</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../local_and_regional_government/local_authorities.html">Local
    authorities</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/health/how_health_is_organised/health_boards.html">Health Service
    Executive</a> </li>
</ul><p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0038/index.html">Ombudsman
(Amendment) Act 2012</a> brought over 180 additional public bodies under the
remit of the Ombudsman with effect from 1 May 2013, including publicly funded
third-level education bodies. The Office has compiled <a href="http://www.ombudsman.gov.ie/en/About-Us/Legislation/Ombudsman-Amendment-Act-2012/Bodies-under-remit-from-May-2013/">an
indicative list of these public bodies</a>.</p>

<h3>How complaints to the Ombudsman are investigated</h3>

<p>If you make a complaint to the Ombudsman, he or she will carry out a
preliminary examination. The preliminary examination is a quick and informal
way of deciding whether a formal investigation is necessary. </p>

<p>During the preliminary examination the Ombudsman will decide whether the
action of the public body that you complained about affected you in a negative
way. You may be interviewed by the Ombudsman in an informal way at this stage.
</p>

<p>The Ombudsman will then consider if the action that you complained about:</p>
<ul><li>Was made without proper authority </li>
  <li>Was made on irrelevant grounds </li>
  <li>Was made in a negligent or careless manner </li>
  <li>Was based on wrong or incomplete information </li>
  <li>Discriminated against you </li>
  <li>Was based on bad administrative practice or </li>
  <li>Was otherwise an example of unfair or unsound administration. </li>
</ul><p>Most complaints do not go any further than the preliminary investigation
stage. </p>

<h3>The formal investigation</h3>

<p>The next step in the process is for the Ombudsman to carry out a formal
investigation. The Ombudsman will draft a Statement of Complaint in
consultation with you. </p>

<p>The investigation will be carried out in private and usually in writing. The
Ombudsman may demand any information, files or documents to help him or her
carry out the investigation. </p>

<p>At the end of the investigation process, the Ombudsman must inform you of
the decision. The Ombudsman only has the power to make a recommendation. His or
her findings are not legally binding and the Ombudsman cannot force the body to
accept or act upon the decision. </p>

<p>If the body that you complained about fails to act upon the decision of the
Ombudsman, the Ombudsman may make a report to the Houses of the Oireachtas. </p>

<h3>Complaints that the Ombudsman cannot investigate</h3>

<p>There are situations where the Ombudsman cannot carry out an investigation
of your complaint:</p>
<ul><li>Where your complaint is about a private company, individual, private
    practitioner, dentist, optician, pharmacist, etc. </li>
  <li>Where your complaint is about the clinical judgement of a doctor </li>
  <li>Where any minister of the Government sends a request in writing to the
    Ombudsman to cease the investigation </li>
  <li>Where the matter you complained is being decided by the courts </li>
  <li>Where legislation gives you a right of appeal against the decision of the
    public body to the courts </li>
  <li>Where legislation gives you a right of appeal against the decision of the
    public body to an independent appeal body </li>
  <li>Where the decision or action of the public body that you complained about
    relates to recruitment or the terms and conditions of employment </li>
  <li>Where you are complaining about a decision relating to immigration or
    naturalisation </li>
  <li>Where you are complaining about a decision relating to a pardon or
    remission of prison sentences </li>
  <li>Where you are complaining about the actions of the Gardai or the
    administration of a prison. </li>
</ul></div>

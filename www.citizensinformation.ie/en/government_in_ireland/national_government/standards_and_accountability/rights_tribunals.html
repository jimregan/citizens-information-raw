<p>There are many tribunals in the State that make binding decisions about
people's rights. A rights tribunal acts like a court; it interprets and applies
the law to make binding decisions on disputes between different parties. </p>

<p>A rights tribunal is established when the Government proposes a Bill that is
passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. A rights tribunal is usually set up to
provide a quick, informal and inexpensive alternative to the courts system in a
specific area of law, for example, employment law. Rights tribunals deal with a
wide range of different types of disputes.</p>

<p>The legislation establishing the tribunal sets out how many members will sit
on the tribunal and whether they will be lawyers, civil servants or
representatives of industry. It will also set out the powers of the tribunal
and the procedures that will be applied. </p>

<p>The terms of the legislation will state whether or not a decision of the
rights tribunal can be appealed in its entirety in the courts. For example, a
decision of the Employment Appeals Tribunal can be appealed in the Circuit
Court. </p>

<p>However, the legislation may also provide that there is no appeal to the
court except by way of <a shape="rect" href="judicial_review_public_decisions.html">judicial review</a> in the High
Court. This means that the court will not substitute its own verdict for the
decision made by the tribunal, but will ensure that the decision was made
fairly. If the decision of the tribunal was made without following fair
procedures, it may be set aside by the High Court.</p>

<p>The State pays the cost of running a rights tribunal. Parties appearing
before a rights tribunal generally have to pay for their own legal
representation. </p>

<p>Some well-known rights tribunals include:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/victims_of_crime/victims_and_compensation.html">Criminal
    Injuries Compensation Tribunal</a>. This tribunal decides the level of
    compensation to be paid to persons who have suffered injuries in the course
    of a criminal act. </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Workplace_Relations_Bodies/Labour_Court/">The

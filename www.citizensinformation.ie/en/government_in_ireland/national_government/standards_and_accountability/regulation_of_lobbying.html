<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Lobbying usually involves making views known to politicians and public
servants about laws, policies and practices and possibly seeking to have those
laws, policies and practices changed. Lobbying takes many different forms. You
may be making your views known as a private citizen on issues which directly
affect you or you may be making submissions or representations on issues that
affect many people. You may be lobbying in person or you may get someone else
to lobby on your behalf. You may conduct the lobbying in writing or orally.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/5/enacted/en/html">Regulation
of Lobbying Act 2015</a> came into effect on 1 September 2015 and provides that
certain people who are carrying on lobbying activities must register with the
<a href="http://www.sipo.gov.ie/en/">Standards in Public Office Commission</a>.
They must also provide information about their lobbying activities.</p>

of Lobbying</a> which is maintained by the Commission is publicly accessible on

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l748bf">Lobbying</h2>

<p>In general, the people who are required to register are:</p>
<ul><li>Professional lobbyists who are paid to lobby on behalf of others</li>
  <li>Individuals and commercial organisations with more than 10 full time
    employees who are lobbying on their own behalf</li>
  <li>Representative bodies with at least 1 full-time employee and the lobbying
    is carried out by a paid employee or office holder</li>
  <li>Advocacy groups, non-governmental organisations and charities which have
    at least 1 full-time employee and which promote particular interests or
    causes, and the lobbying is carried out by a paid employee or office
  holder</li>
</ul><p>Other individuals may be obliged to register if they are engaged in lobbying
in relation to the development or zoning of land. See ‘Development and zoning
of land’ below.</p>

<p>You must register if:</p>
<ul><li>You are carrying on lobbying activities</li>
  <li>The person you are lobbying is a <em>designated public official</em></li>
  <li>You are making a relevant <em>communication</em></li>
  <li>The communication is about a <em>relevant matter</em> and is not an
    <em>excepted communication</em></li>
</ul><h3>Designated public official</h3>

<p>The communication must be with a designated public official. Designated
public officials are:</p>
<ul><li>Ministers of the Government and Ministers of State</li>
  <li>Other members of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann</li>
  <li>Members of the European Parliament for constituencies in the State</li>
  <li>Members of local authorities</li>
  <li>Special advisers</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/si/367/made/en/print">Prescribed
    public servants and office holders</a></li>
</ul><p>Public bodies are obliged to publish information on their employees who are
designated public officials.</p>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>You must be making a relevant communication. A relevant communication means
an oral or written communication made personally (directly or indirectly) to a
designated public official in relation to a relevant matter. It does not
include certain types of communication. See ‘Excepted communications’
below.</p>

<p>A relevant matter means any matter relating to:</p>
<ul><li>The initiation, development or modification of any public policy or of
    any public programme,</li>
  <li>The preparation or amendment of any law</li>
  <li>The award of any grant, loan or other financial support, contract or
    other agreement, or of any licence or other authorisation involving public
    funds</li>
</ul><p>It does not include any matter relating only to the implementation of any
such policy, programme, enactment or award, or which is of a technical
nature.</p>

<h4>Excepted communications</h4>

<p>Certain types of communication, known as excepted communications, are not
considered to be lobbying under the legislation. These include:</p>
<ul><li>Communications by or on behalf of an individual relating to their private
    affairs about any matter other than the development or zoning of land</li>
  <li>Communications requesting factual information or providing factual
    information in response to a request for the information</li>
  <li>Communications requested by a public service body and published by it</li>
</ul><p>You can find <a href="https://www.lobbying.ie/help-resources/information-for-lobbyists/guidelines-for-people-carrying-on-lobbying-activities/are-you-affected-by-the-legislation/#E.">more
information on excepted communications</a> on <a href="https://www.lobbying.ie/">lobbying.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>Development and zoning of land</h3>

<p>You are considered to be lobbying if you make a relevant communication about
the development or zoning of land under the Planning and Development Acts 2000
to 2014.</p>

<p>A communication about obtaining planning permission to build or extend your
principal private residence is considered an excepted communication and
therefore not lobbying. Under the legislation, your principal private residence
is a dwelling or part of a dwelling occupied by you as your only or main
residence. It includes your residence’s garden or grounds, up to 1 acre
exclusive of the dwelling, which you have for your own occupation and
enjoyment.</p>

<p>Making your views known to a local authority is not considered to be
lobbying if it is part of a formal public consultation process about a
development or local area plan or a proposal to zone or re-zone particular
lands. However, if you communicate with a designated public official outside
the formal public consultation process you may have to register your lobbying
activity.</p>

<p>Applications for planning permission and submissions in relation to an
application for planning permission are not lobbying. A communication, however,
with a designated public official about a planning application which is outside
of the formal planning process may be regarded as lobbying.</p>

<p>You can find more information in the Commission’s <a href="https://www.lobbying.ie/help-resources/information-for-lobbyists/guidelines-in-relation-to-development-and-zoning-of-land/">Guidelines
on lobbying in relation to development and zoning of land</a>.</p>

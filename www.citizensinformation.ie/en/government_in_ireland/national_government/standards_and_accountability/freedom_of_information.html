<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0013/index.html">Freedom
of Information Act 1997</a> (FOI) as amended by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0009/index.html">Freedom
of Information (Amendment) Act 2003</a> obliged government departments, the
Health Service Executive (HSE), local authorities and a range of other public
bodies to publish information on their activities and to make the information
they held, including personal information, available to citizens.</p>

<p>On 14 October 2014, the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0030/index.html">Freedom
of Information Act 2014</a> came into effect and repealed the 1997 and 2003
Acts. The new Act introduced a number of changes to the Freedom of Information
scheme and widened the range of bodies to which the FOI legislation applies to
all public bodies, unless specifically exempt. It also allows for the
Government to prescribe (or designate) other bodies receiving significant
public funds, so that the FOI legislation applies to them also.</p>

<p>The old legislation continues to apply to any FOI request made before the
new legislation came into effect. It also applies to any subsequent review or
appeal.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The Freedom of Information Act 2014 provides the following statutory
rights:</p>
<ul><li>A legal right for each person to access information held by a body to
    which FOI legislation applies</li>
  <li>A legal right for each person to have official information relating to
    himself/herself amended where it is incomplete, incorrect or misleading</li>
  <li>A legal right to obtain reasons for decisions affecting
  himself/herself.</li>
</ul><h3>Publication scheme</h3>

<p>Section 8 of the Act requires FOI bodies to prepare a publication scheme
concerning the publication of information by the body in conformity with a <a href="http://foi.gov.ie/download/model-publication-scheme-october-2015/">model
publication scheme</a> and <a href="http://foi.gov.ie/download/model-publication-scheme-guidance-october-2015/">guidelines</a>.
This provides for the publication of information on an FOI body’s website
outside of FOI. An FOI body is required to:</p>
<ul><li>Publish information to assist members of the public in their
    understanding of the body and its functions</li>
  <li>Publish the information it holds grouped under the information headings
    set out in the model publication scheme</li>
  <li>Explain the procedures to get access to information or to establish what
    information the body holds</li>
</ul><p>The requirement to publish an FOI body’s publication scheme came into
effect on 14 April 2016.</p>

<h3>Requests for information</h3>

<p>You can ask for the following records:</p>
<ul><li>Any records relating to you personally, whenever they were created</li>
  <li>All other records created after a certain date <br>
    - 21 October 1998 for the HSE and local authorities <br>
    - 21 April 1998 for public bodies that were covered by the old FOI
    legislation <br>
    - 21 April 2008 for public bodies that were not covered by the old FOI
    legislation <br>
    - the date of the prescribing order (or a specified date) for prescribed
    bodies</li>
</ul><p>A record can be a paper document or information held on computer. It
includes, for example, printouts, maps, plans, microfilm, audio-visual
material, disks and tapes.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Section 27 of the Freedom of Information Act 2014 provides for fees and
charges. No fees apply where the request involves access to your personal
records. </p>

<p>The current fees for non-personal requests are:</p>

      <td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Free</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Free</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>* There are no fees where you appeal a decision to charge a fee or deposit,
or a fee or deposit of a specific amount.</p>

<p>** Reduced fees will apply in respect of medical card holders and third
parties who appeal a decision to release their information on public interest
grounds.</p>

<h3>Charges for search, retrieval and copying of records</h3>

<p>Charges may be applied by the body for the time spent finding and retrieving
records, and for any copying costs incurred by them in providing you with the
material requested. It is very unlikely that any charges will be applied in
respect of personal records, except where a large number of records are
involved.</p>

<p>If the cost of search, retrieval and copying is €100 or less, no charge is
applied. If the charge exceeds €100, full fees apply. You cannot be charged
more than €500.</p>

<p>If the estimated cost of search, retrieval and copying is more than €700
the body can refuse to process your request, unless you refine your request to
bring the search, retrieval and copying fees below this limit.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>It is important to note that it may not be necessary to make a request for
information under the Freedom of Information Act from a body. A considerable
amount of material is already made available to the public through websites,
information leaflets, publications and in response to oral and written
enquiries. Most organisations have a dedicated information section, which is
available to assist you with general queries, requests for information and
publications.</p>

<p>If the information you require is not readily available, you must make your
request in writing to the FOI Unit of the body and your application should
refer to the Freedom of Information Act. If your application for information
does not mention the Act, then your application will be dealt with as an
ordinary request for information. If information is required in a particular
form (for example, photocopy or computer disk) this should be specified in the
application.</p>

<p>Try to be as specific as you can in order to enable the organisation to
identify the information you require. Where possible try to indicate the time
period for which you wish to access records (for example, records created
between May 2012 and December 2012).</p>

<p>Under the Act, a request for records must be acknowledged within 2 weeks
and, in most cases, responded to within 4 weeks. If a third party is involved,
there may be another 3 weeks before you receive a response.</p>

<p>You can find more <a href="http://foi.gov.ie/faqs/how-do-i-make-an-foi-request/">information on
making a request</a> on the foi.gov.ie website.</p>

<h3>FOI review procedures</h3>

<p>If you are not satisfied with the response of the body to any aspect of your
request for information (for example, refusal of information, form of access,
charges) you can seek to have the decision re-examined. Also, if you have not
received a reply within 4 weeks of your initial application (this is deemed a
refusal of your request) you can seek to have the decision re-examined. </p>

<p>The internal review of an FOI decision is carried out by more senior members
of staff within the body and must be made within 3 weeks. An application for
review of a decision should be addressed to the FOI Unit of the body
involved.</p>

<h3>FOI appeals</h3>

<p>If you are still unhappy with the decision, you have the right to appeal the
decision to the Information Commissioner. The Information Commissioner
investigates complaints of non-compliance with FOI legislation and generally
promotes a freedom of information culture in the public service.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/high_court.html">High
Court</a> has a power or "jurisdiction" called "judicial review". Judicial
review is a way for the High Court to supervise the lower courts, <a shape="rect" href="../tribunals_and_investigations/tribunals_introduction.html">tribunals</a>
and other administrative bodies to ensure that they make their decisions
properly and in accordance with the law. Judicial review is primarily concerned
with the decision-making process rather than with the substance of the
decision. There is, however, a limited scope for review of the substance of a
decision as well. </p>

<p>Judicial review is divided into two main categories: </p>
<ul><li><strong>Conventional judicial review</strong>: Procedure governing
    conventional judicial review is to be found in <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/8652fb610b0b37a980256db700399507/a53b0f76ffc6c5b780256d2b0046b3dc?OpenDocument">Order
    84 of the Rules of the Superior Courts</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Statutory judicial review</strong>: Specialised statutory schemes
    of judicial review relating to specific areas of public decision-making
    which have been singled out by the Oireachtas as warranting specialised
    schemes because of the policy concerns involved. Statutory schemes and the
    procedure involved are covered by legislation specific to that area.
    Statutory schemes apply to such areas as asylum, pollution control,
    planning and the takeover of companies.</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="ld7033">Judicial review of public decisions </h2>

<p>Public decisions made by administrative bodies and the lower courts may be
judicially reviewed by the High Court. In a judicial review, generally the
court is not concerned with the merits of the decision but rather with the
lawfulness of the decision-making process, that is, how the decision was made
and the fairness of it. </p>

<p>Some examples of public decisions include: </p>
<ul><li>Decisions of the District and Circuit Courts </li>
  <li>Inquest verdicts </li>
  <li>Decisions of tribunals </li>
  <li>Deductions from army pensions </li>
  <li>Discharge of a member of the defence forces </li>
  <li>Disqualification from receiving social welfare payments </li>
  <li>Refusals of an Irish passport, marriage certificate, or visa </li>
  <li>Decisions to deport asylum-seekers </li>
  <li>Decisions of <a shape="rect" href="http://www.pleanala.ie">An Bord
    Pleanála</a> relating to planning permission </li>
  <li>Decisions of Government bodies that require an Environmental Impact
    Assessment and/or an Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC)
    licence. </li>
  <li>Decisions of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.legalaidboard.ie">Legal
    Aid Board</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.lawsociety.ie">Law
    Society</a>.</li>
  <li>Decisions of a public administrative body relating to the
  environment.</li>
</ul><p>The basic principles of public decision-making are: </p>
<ul><li>The decision-maker must have authority to make the decision that affects
    you. If the decision-maker has the authority to make the decision, it must
    not go beyond the limits of its authority. </li>
  <li>You are entitled to fair procedures in how the decision is reached. This
    means that the decision-maker must not be biased and the decision-maker
    must give you a fair hearing. You must be given an adequate opportunity to
    present your case. You must be informed of the matter and you must be given
    a chance to comment on the material put forward by the other side. </li>
  <li>The decision maker must comply with all legal requirements governing the
    decision and its making.</li>
</ul><p>If the decision-maker does not have authority or does not give you fair
procedure, you may bring judicial review proceedings in the High Court to
challenge the decision. You must show that you have "sufficient interest" in
the proceedings, that is, that you were affected in some way by the decision
you are challenging. You must also show that you have an arguable case, that
is, that your case has grounds. </p>

<p>The High Court will examine the decision and how it was reached and will
decide whether or not it was unconstitutional or illegal. The High Court may
then quash or cancel the decision – by issuing an order known as certiorari.
The High Court can also order a decision maker, who is obliged to make a
decision but has failed or refused to do so, to actually make the decision –
this is known as an order of mandamus. An order of prohibition may also be
granted in appropriate circumstances – i.e. an order prohibiting a decision
maker from making a decision. Other orders that are available include
declarations, injunctions of an interim, interlocutory or permanent nature, or
an award of damages.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l40e05">Judicial review procedure </h2>

<p>Judicial review is primarily concerned with the procedural legality of the
decision but does provide for a limited review of the merits of the decision. A
decision of an administrative body may be set aside on the basis that it is
unreasonable or irrational or possibly disproportionate.</p>

<p>Conventional judicial review procedure is governed by <a href="http://www.courts.ie/rules.nsf/8652fb610b0b37a980256db700399507/a53b0f76ffc6c5b780256d2b0046b3dc?OpenDocument">Order
84 of the Rules of the Superior Courts</a>.</p>

<h3>Leave stage</h3>

<p>The first step in the judicial review procedure involves the mandatory
“leave stage”. At this stage an application for leave to bring judicial
review proceedings must first be made. The leave stage is used to identify and
filter out, at an early stage, claims which may be trivial or without merit. At
the leave stage you must show that you have "sufficient interest" in the
matter. In other words, you must demonstrate that you are affected in some way
by the decision you are challenging. Specialised statutory schemes for judicial
review may prescribe who may apply for leave. You must also show that you have
an arguable case and that your case has grounds and a reasonable chance of
success.</p>

<p>The application to the court is based on a statement of grounds. This
statement should set out the reasons a judicial review is sought. It should be
accompanied by an affidavit.</p>

<p>If leave to proceed is granted, the applicant may then bring judicial review
proceedings. A notice of motion should be prepared and, along with the court
order granting leave to proceed with the judicial review and both the statement
of grounds and the affidavit prepared for the earlier stage, served on all
persons directly affected by the application.</p>

<h3>Statement of Opposition </h3>

<p>A respondent who wishes to oppose an application for judicial review is
required to file a Statement of Opposition, and may file a replying affidavit
contesting the facts set out by the applicant. Once the pleadings have closed,
the matter proceeds to a hearing.</p>

<h3>Notice parties</h3>

<p>Any person who may be affected by the judicial review proceedings and
judgment should be notified or may apply to be heard as a notice party. For
example where a person challenges a planning permission granted by An Bord
Pleanála (the respondent) the applicant for the planning permission would also
be entitled to be heard in the proceedings as a notice party as the proceedings
will have an impact on his planning application.</p>

<h3>Time limits </h3>

<p>Order 84, Rule 21 (1) of the Rules of the Superior Courts provides that an
application for leave to apply for judicial review shall be made within 3
months from the date when grounds for the application first arose.</p>

<p>Where the relief sought is an order of certiorari in respect of any
judgement, order, conviction or other proceeding, the date when grounds for the
application first arose shall be taken to be the date of that judgement, order,
conviction or proceeding.</p>

<p>However Order 84, Rule 21 (3) provides for an extension of time for an
application for judicial review but the court shall only extend such period if
it is satisfied that:</p>
<ul><li>There is good and sufficient reason for doing so,
  <strong>and</strong></li>
  <li>The circumstances that resulted in the failure to make the application
    for leave within the three month time period either: 
    <p>(i) were outside the control of, or</p>
    <p>(ii) could not reasonably have been anticipated by the applicant for
    such extension.</p>
  </li>
</ul><p>Moreover Order 84, Rule 21 (4) also provides that in considering whether
good and sufficient reason exists for granting an extension of time, the court
may have regard to the effect which an extension of the period may have on a
respondent or third party.</p>

<p>Order 84, Rule 21 (5) provides that an application for an extension shall be
grounded upon an affidavit sworn by or on behalf of the applicant which shall
set out the reasons for the applicant’s failure to make the application for
leave within the three month period and shall verify any facts relied on in
support of those reasons.</p>

<h3>Statutory schemes </h3>

<p>Statutory judicial review schemes supplement Order 84 of the Rules of the
Superior Courts with their own specific procedural rules. These statutory
schemes narrow the availability of review through such features as:</p>
<ul><li>Time limits for an application for leave are shorter </li>
  <li>Requirements to notify the decision-maker of the leave application </li>
  <li>Higher thresholds applied by the High Court when considering whether to
    allow leave, for example, substantial grounds rather than arguable case.
  </li>
</ul><p>Examples of statutory schemes are available in our document: <a shape="rect" href="/en/environment/environmental_protection/judicial_review_in_planning_and_environmental_matters.html">Judicial
review in planning and environmental matters</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you wish to begin judicial review proceedings, you may want to contact a
<a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a> who
will in turn brief a barrister to draft the papers for the case. It is also
possible for you to represent yourself if you wish to keep your legal costs
down. </p>

<h3>Costs </h3>

<p>There is no fixed rate of charges for legal fees so you should obtain some
quotes before deciding on legal representation. Your solicitor must advise you
in writing of the fees you will be charged for his/her services. If it is not
possible to give you a definite sum, he/she must estimate a sum or at the very
least describe the basis upon which charges or fees will be calculated.</p>

certain environmental matters is available in our document: <a shape="rect" href="/en/environment/environmental_protection/judicial_review_in_planning_and_environmental_matters.html">Judicial

<p>The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner is responsible for upholding
the privacy rights of individuals in relation to the processing of their
personal data.</p>

<p>These rights are contained in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dataprotection.ie/documents/legal/CompendiumAct.pdf">Data
Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 (pdf)</a>. The Acts state that information about
you must be accurate, only made available to those that should have it and only
used for specified purposes. You have the right to access personal information
relating to you and have any errors corrected or, in some cases, have the
information erased.</p>

<p>If your information is being held for the purposes of direct marketing, you
can have your details removed.</p>

<p>Data protection rights apply to information held on computer or in manual or
paper files.</p>

<p>The Commissioner is appointed by the Government and is independent in the
exercise of her functions. Individuals who feel their rights are being
infringed can complain to the Commissioner. She has powers to enforce the
provisions of the Act.</p>

<p>If you suffer damage as a result of a breach of your data protection rights,
you may sue for damages through the courts.</p>

<p>The Commissioner also maintains a register, available for public inspection,
giving general details about the data handling practices of many important data
controllers, such as government departments and State-sector bodies, financial
institutions, and any person or organisation who keeps sensitive types of
personal data.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>To access information relating to you, send a letter or email to the
organisation or person holding your personal details and ask them for a copy of
this information. You should receive them within 40 calendar days of your
request. You may have to pay a small fee of €6.35.</p>

<p>If you find that an organisation or person has details about you that are
not factually correct, you can ask them to change or, in some cases, remove
these details. If you feel that they do not have a valid reason for holding
your personal details or that they have taken these details in an unfair way,
you can ask them to change or remove these details. You can also ask them not
to use your personal details for purposes other than their main purpose.</p>

<p>Write to the organisation or person, explaining your concerns or outlining
which details are incorrect. Within 40 days, they must do as you ask or explain
why they will not do so.</p>

<p>Further <a href="http://www.dataprotection.ie/ViewDoc.asp?fn=/documents/rights/RightsPlainEnglish.htm&amp;CatID=16&amp;m=r">information
on your rights</a> and how to obtain them is available on the Commissioner’s
website</p>

<p>To make a complaint to the Data Protection Commissioner, simply write to or
email the Commissioner explaining your case. You should include the following
details:</p>
<ul><li>The name of the organisation or person you are complaining about</li>
  <li>The steps you have taken to have your concerns dealt with</li>
  <li>The details of any response you have received</li>
</ul><p>You should provide copies of any letters or emails exchanged between you and
the organisation or person.</p>

<p>If the Commissioner agrees with your complaint, she will try to make sure
that the organisation or person obeys the law and puts matters right. If the
Data Protection Commissioner does not accept your complaint, you may appeal to
the Circuit Court against her decision within 21 days.</p>

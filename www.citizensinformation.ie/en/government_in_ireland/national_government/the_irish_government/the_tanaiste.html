<h2>Information</h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Constitution</a>
states that the <a shape="rect" href="the_taoiseach.html">Taoiseach</a> must
nominate a member of <a shape="rect" href="../houses_of_the_oireachtas/dail_eireann.html">DÃ¡il Eireann</a> for the
position of Tanaiste. The Tanaiste is the deputy Taoiseach. </p>

<p>They act in place of the Taoiseach if the Taoiseach is abroad or ill. If the
Taoiseach were to die or become permanently incapacitated, the Tanaiste would
stand in until a new Taoiseach was appointed. </p>

<p>The Tanaiste may also hold a ministerial portfolio, which means that they
may also be a minister of a <a shape="rect" href="../../government_departments/departments_of_state.html">Department of
State</a>. Information on the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Taoiseach_and_Government/List_of_Ministers_Ministers_of_State/">current
Tanaiste is available here</a>.</p>
</div>
Like the other members of the Government, the Tanaiste may be dismissed by the
Taoiseach if they consider that there is sufficient reason to do so.</div>

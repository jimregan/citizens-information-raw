<h2>Information</h2>

<p>Article 28 of Bunreacht na hÉireann (the Irish <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Constitution</a>)
sets out the composition of Government. The Constitution states that the
Government must not be smaller than 7 members or larger than 15 members. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="the_taoiseach.html">Taoiseach</a> is the head of
the Irish Government. He or she is nominated by the Dáil (one of the houses of
Parliament) and formally appointed by the <a shape="rect" href="../../the_president/president_introduction_to_the_president_of_ireland.html">Irish
President</a>. Normally, each of the political parties or a coalition of
parties will have its own nominee for Taoiseach. The nominee who has the
support of the majority of the members of the Dáil will become Taoiseach.</p>

<p>The Taoiseach then nominates the other members of the Government and gives
each of them a <a shape="rect" href="../../government_departments/departments_of_state.html">Department of
State</a>. They are approved by the Dáil and appointed by the President. You
can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Taoiseach_and_Government/List_of_Ministers_Ministers_of_State/">view
this list of current Irish Government Ministers</a>.</p>

<p>If the Government is made up of 2 or more political parties, it is called a
<a shape="rect" href="coalition_government.html">coalition government</a>. The
2 parties will share the positions in the Government - usually the position of
<a shape="rect" href="the_tanaiste.html">Tánaiste</a> is given to the leader
of the smaller party in coalition. </p>

<p>The members of the Government must be members of either <a shape="rect" href="../houses_of_the_oireachtas/dail_eireann.html">Dáil Éireann</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../houses_of_the_oireachtas/the_seanad.html">Seanad
Éireann</a>. There cannot be more than 2 members of Seanad Éireann appointed
to the Government. The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance
must be members of Dáil Éireann.</p>

<p>The Taoiseach may also appoint Ministers of State who are also known as
Junior Ministers. They are not actually members of the Cabinet but they help
Government ministers in their parliamentary and departmental work. </p>

<p>The Taoiseach will also appoint an <a shape="rect" href="the_attorney_general.html">Attorney General</a> to advise the Government
on legal issues. The Attorney General is not a member of the Government but
he/she traditionally attends at Cabinet meetings. </p>

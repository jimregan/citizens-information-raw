<h2>Information</h2>

<p>After a <a shape="rect" href="../../elections_and_referenda/national_elections/the_general_election.html">general
election</a>, the party with the support of the majority of the members in the
Dáil will secure the nomination of <a shape="rect" href="the_taoiseach.html">Taoiseach</a> who will then set up a government. </p>

<p>If, after a general election, no party can get the support of the majority
of the members of the Dáil, 2 or more parties may agree to work together as a
<em>coalition government</em>. </p>

<p>The coalition parties will agree on who will be nominated as Taoiseach.
Usually, it is the leader of the larger party. In recent years, the practice
has been to nominate the leader of the smaller party as <a shape="rect" href="the_tanaiste.html">Tánaiste</a>. </p>

<p>The ministerial portfolios will then be shared between the parties. Usually
the larger party will be given a greater number of portfolios. The leader of
each party will decide which elected members of the party to allocate those
portfolios to. </p>

<p>The coalition government will remain in power for as long as it keeps the
support of the majority of the Dáil. If the coalition parties find that for
some reason they cannot agree and can no longer work together, the Taoiseach
may advise the President to <a shape="rect" href="../houses_of_the_oireachtas/dissolution_of_the_dail.html">dissolve the
Dáil</a>. </p>

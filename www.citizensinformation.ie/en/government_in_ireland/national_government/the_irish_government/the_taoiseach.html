<p>The Taoiseach is the head of the Government. He or she is nominated by the
<a shape="rect" href="../houses_of_the_oireachtas/dail_eireann.html">D치il</a>
(one of the Irish houses of Parliament) and is appointed by the <a shape="rect" href="../../the_president/president_introduction_to_the_president_of_ireland.html">President</a>.
The Taoiseach then nominates the other members of the Government. They are
approved by the D치il and appointed by the President. He may dismiss them if
there is sufficient reason to do so. You can read this <a shape="rect" href="http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Taoiseach_and_Government/About_the_Taoiseach/">information
on the current Taoiseach</a>.</p>

<p>The Taoiseach acts as a channel of communication between the Government and
the President. He or she advises the President about summoning and <a shape="rect" href="../houses_of_the_oireachtas/dissolution_of_the_dail.html">dissolving the
D치il</a>. He or she presents Bills (or proposals for legislation) to the
President for signature so that they can become Acts with legal effect. The
Taoiseach also keeps the President generally informed on domestic and
international policy matters. </p>

<p>As the leading public figure in the Government, the Taoiseach also acts as a
spokesperson for the Government on major policy issues and chairs Cabinet
meetings. </p>

<p>He or she takes an interest in the affairs of all the <a shape="rect" href="../../government_departments/departments_of_state.html">Departments of
State</a> and ensures that the plans of departments are co-ordinated. He or she
makes sure that Cabinet decisions are carried out by the ministers and that the
ministers fully understand the implications of different Government policies.
</p>

<p>The Taoiseach also has a major role to play in our relations with foreign
countries. He or she represents Ireland abroad and regularly meets with the
other heads of state of the European Union to help shape European policy. </p>

<p>The Taoiseach and all the ministers collectively are <a shape="rect" href="../houses_of_the_oireachtas/question_time.html">answerable to D치il
Eireann</a>. The Taoiseach is assisted in his or her duties by the <a shape="rect" href="the_government_chief_whip.html">Government Chief Whip</a>.

<p>If a TD (member of Parliament) dies or resigns, his or her seat in
Parliament will be filled by a bye-election unless it is only a short time
until the next <a shape="rect" href="the_general_election.html">general
election</a>. </p>

<p>When a TD dies or resigns, the <a shape="rect" href="../../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/dail_eireann.html">Dáil</a>
(one of the houses of Parliament in Ireland) passes a resolution directing that
a writ be issued to the returning officer of the TD's constituency to hold an
election to fill the vacancy. Until 2011 there was no time limit for the
passing of the resolution by the Dáil. The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0014/index.html">Electoral
(Amendment) Act 2011</a> provides that if the Dáil does not move to have the
writ issued within 6 months the Ceann Comhairle must direct the Clerk of the
Dáil to issue the writ. </p>

<p>Tradition dictates that when a TD dies, the former member's own party will
move the writ but not until at least a month has passed. </p>

<p>The procedure for the <a shape="rect" href="nomination_for_membership_of_dail_eireann.html">nomination of
candidates</a>, <a shape="rect" href="voting_procedure_in_a_general_election.html">voting</a> and the conduct
of the <a shape="rect" href="../voting/proportional_representation.html">count</a> in Dáil
bye-elections is the same as for a <a shape="rect" href="the_general_election.html">general election</a>. The difference is that
only one seat is being filled in a bye-election.</p>

<p>A person who is currently a member of Dáil Eireann cannot be a candidate in
a Dáil bye-election. </p>

<h3>Bye-election posters and signs</h3>

<p>The law forbids the erection of posters and signs on poles or other
structures in public places unless you have the written permission of the owner
of the pole or other structure in advance of putting up the posters and signs.
Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0012/index.html">Litter
Pollution Act 1997</a>, as amended by <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0009/sec0009.html">Section
9 of the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2009</a>, election posters and signs
cannot be erected until an order has been made appointing the polling date for
the bye-election or for 30 days prior to the date of the poll (whichever is the
shorter period). <a shape="rect" href="../../local_and_regional_government/local_authorities.html">Local
authorities</a> have the power to remove these items should they disintegrate
or cause a litter nuisance. </p>

<p>Following a bye-election, a party or candidate <span>must remove
posters</span> within a <span>7-day period</span>. After that date, an
on-the-spot fine of €150 is issued by your local authority in respect of each
remaining poster. Your local authority will remove the poster as the fine is
issued. If a party or candidate has been issued with a fine and refuses to pay,
they can be prosecuted in the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a> by your
local authority to enforce payment. The maximum penalty in the District Court
following conviction for non-payment of the fine is €3,000. </p>

<h2>Information</h2>

<p>A general election must be held within 30 days of the <a shape="rect" href="../../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/dissolution_of_the_dail.html">dissolution
of the Dáil</a>. The procedure is that the Clerk of the Dáil issues a writ to
the returning officer in each constituency instructing them to hold an
election. </p>

<p>The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government appoints the polling
day which must be between the 18th and 25th day (excluding Good Friday, Sundays
and public holidays) after the issue of the writ. The Minister also appoints
the polling period which must consist of at least 12 hours between 7am and
10.30pm.</p>

</ul><h3>General election posters and signs</h3>

<p>The law forbids the erection of posters or signs on poles or other
structures in public places unless you have the written permission of the owner
of the pole or other structure in advance of putting up the posters or signs.
Posters are only allowed to be erected for a certain specified time period
before an election. Posters can be erected 30 days before the election or from
the date of the polling day order for the election, whichever is the shorter
period of time. </p>

<p>Following a general election, a party or candidate <span>must remove
posters</span> within a <span>7-day period</span>. After that date, an
on-the-spot fine of €150 is issued by your local authority in respect of each
offence. Your local authority will remove the poster as the fine is issued. If
a party or candidate has been issued with a fine and refuses to pay, they can
be prosecuted in the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a> by their
local authority to enforce payment. </p>

<p>Before the election, 5 panels are formed of candidates who represent
vocational interests, namely, culture and education, agriculture, labour,
industry and commerce, and administration. Each panel consists of 2 sub-panels
– the Nominating Bodies sub-panel and the Oireachtas sub-panel.</p>

<p>Candidates are nominated to the Nominating Bodies sub-panels by
organisations that represent a particular vocational interest and are
registered as nominating bodies for a particular panel.</p>

<p>Candidates are nominated to the Oireachtas sub-panels by members of the
Dáil and the outgoing members of the Seanad.</p>

<p>Once the nomination of Seanad panel candidates has taken place, the
returning officer sends a list of the candidates nominated for each panel to
each voter. The list will indicate the name of the candidate and the bodies or
persons who nominated them.</p>

<h3>Voting</h3>

<p>On the day of the poll, the returning officer sends each voter 5 ballot
papers by registered post - one for each panel. The ballot papers will show the
names of the candidates in alphabetical order, their addresses and descriptions
and the sub-panel they were nominated to.</p>

<p>If the candidates have a political affiliation, this is not mentioned on the
ballot paper.</p>

<p>The voter marks the order of their choice of candidates and returns the
ballot papers by registered post to the returning officer.</p>

<p>There is a separate count for each panel. The candidates are elected
according to the principle of <a shape="rect" href="../voting/proportional_representation.html">proportional
representation</a> with single transferable vote. </p>

<p>A quota of votes is calculated to work out the number of votes necessary to
become a candidate. If a candidate reaches the quota they are deemed elected.
</p>

<p>If a candidate obtains more votes than the quota, the surplus will be
distributed to the remaining candidates in accordance with the next preference
shown on the ballot papers. If no candidate reaches the quota, the candidate
with the least votes is eliminated and their votes are distributed according to
the next preference shown on the ballot papers.</p>

<p>The number of candidates who can be elected from each panel are as
follows;</p>
<ul><li>Cultural and educational panel - 5 members including at least 2 from each
    sub-panel </li>
  <li>Agricultural panel - 11 members including at least 4 from each sub-panel
  </li>
  <li>Labour panel - 11 members including at least 4 from each sub-panel </li>
  <li>Industrial and Commercial panel - 9 members including at least 3 from
    each sub-panel </li>
  <li>Administrative panel - 7 members including at least 3 from each
    sub-panel. </li>
</ul><p>If a Senator dies, resigns or is disqualified from the Seanad, the vacancy
will be filled by a <a shape="rect" href="seanad_panel_by_elections.html">by-election</a>.</p>

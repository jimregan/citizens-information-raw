<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Constitution states that 6 members of the Seanad may be elected by the
universities of Ireland. The <a shape="rect" href="seanad_university_constituency.html">University Constituency</a> consists
of graduates of the National University of Ireland and the University of
Dublin. </p>

<p>To put yourself forward as a candidate for the Seanad, you must be nominated
by 2 registered electors for a university. Eight other registered electors for
the university concerned must assent to the nomination. You do not have to be a
graduate of the university concerned or be connected to it in any way. However,
you must be eligible to become a Senator. </p>

<p>Voting in the university elections for the Seanad is done by post. The
returning officer sends a ballot paper and a "declaration of identity" form to
every person eligible to vote. </p>

<p>The voter completes the declaration of identity form in the presence of a
witness. They then complete the ballot paper by marking their order of
preference of candidates. Both the declaration of identity and the ballot paper
are sent back to the returning officer. </p>

<p>The votes are counted and the system of <a shape="rect" href="../voting/proportional_representation.html">proportional
representation</a> with single transferable vote applies.</p>

<p>If a casual vacancy arises it will be filled by a by-election. The procedure
is the same as in an ordinary election except that only one candidate is
elected instead of 6.</p>

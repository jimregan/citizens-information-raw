<h2>Information</h2>

<p>Eleven members of the Seanad are nominated by the <a shape="rect" href="../../national_government/the_irish_government/the_taoiseach.html">Taoiseach</a>.
The Taoiseach can nominate any person who is <a shape="rect" href="../../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/the_seanad.html">eligible
to become a Senator</a>.</p>

<p>When the Government is a <a shape="rect" href="../../national_government/the_irish_government/coalition_government.html">coalition
government</a>, it is usual for the nominations to be shared between the
parties in proportion to party strengths.</p>

<p>Normally, the Taoiseach makes his nominations after the other Seanad seats
have been filled. </p>

<p>Under the Constitution, 2 Senators may become <a shape="rect" href="../../national_government/the_irish_government/composition_of_the_government.html">members
of the Government</a> so it is possible for the Taoiseach to nominate a person
so that they can be appointed to the Government.</p>

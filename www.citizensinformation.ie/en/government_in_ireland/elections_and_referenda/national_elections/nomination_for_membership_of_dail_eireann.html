to be nominated as a candidate in more than one constituency and you don't
necessarily have to be living in a constituency to be nominated. If you wish,
you may state your party affiliation on your nomination paper. You may also
submit a photograph and/or a political party emblem to appear on the ballot
paper. </p>

<p>The returning officer must decide on the validity of your nomination paper
within one hour after it is presented to them. They will object to your name

  <li>It is unnecessarily long or </li>
  <li>It contains a political reference </li>

letter free of postage charge to every elector in the constituency. If you are
a member of a political party with another candidate in the constituency, you
will only be allowed one election letter free of postage charge between you.</p>

constituency by 12 noon on the 7th day after the <a shape="rect" href="../../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/dissolution_of_the_dail.html">issue

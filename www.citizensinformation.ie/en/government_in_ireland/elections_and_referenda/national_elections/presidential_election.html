<p>The <a href="http://www.president.ie/index.php?section=1&amp;lang=eng">Irish
President</a> is elected directly by the people of Ireland for a term of 7
years. They may not serve more than 2 terms. (In other words, they cannot serve
for more than 14 years). Ireland's current President is <a shape="rect" href="http://www.president.ie/biography/">Michael D. Higgins</a> who commenced
his first term as President on 11 November 2011. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You must be an Irish citizen to vote in a Presidential election.</p>

<p>The candidates for election must be eligible to become President and must be
nominated. The <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Irish
constitution</a> (Bunreacht na hEireann) sets down what these eligibility
requirements are. To be eligible for election as President, you must be an
Irish citizen and over 35 years old.</p>

<p>You may be nominated as President by at least 20 members of the Oireachtas
(that is the <a shape="rect" href="../../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/dail_eireann.html">Dail</a>
and the <a shape="rect" href="../../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/the_seanad.html">Seanad</a>)
or by at least 4 <a shape="rect" href="../../local_and_regional_government/local_authorities.html">local
authorities</a>.</p>

<p>A former or retiring President is eligible for re-election and may nominate
him/herself.</p>

<p>The election must take place by the date on which the current President's
term of office expires but may not take place more than 60 days before this. If
the current President is <a shape="rect" href="../../the_president/inauguration_and_removal_of_the_president.html">removed</a>,
becomes incapacitated, resigns or dies, then an election must be held within
the following 60 days.</p>

<p>The Presidential election is by secret ballot and based on <a shape="rect" href="../voting/proportional_representation.html">proportional
representation</a> by the single transferable vote.</p>

<p>Where there is only one candidate nominated for the office of President, it
is not necessary to proceed to a ballot for election. This occurred most
recently in November 2004 where Mary McAleese was inaugurated as President for
a second term without a presidential election as she was the only candidate.</p>
The spending limit in a Presidential election is €750,000 and the amount a
candidate can be reimbursed from the State is €200,000. <br></div>

<h2>Information</h2>

<p>It is possible to have an <em><span>ordinary referendum</span></em> which is
one that does not relate to amending <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Bunreacht na
hEireann</a> (the Irish Constitution). Since the foundation of the State
however, no ordinary referendum has ever been held.</p>

<p>An ordinary referendum would take place if the <a shape="rect" href="../../the_president/president_introduction_to_the_president_of_ireland.html">Irish
President</a> received a joint petition from both houses of the Oireachtas (the
Irish Parliament), that is, <a shape="rect" href="../../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/dail_eireann.html">the
Dáil</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/the_seanad.html">the
Seanad</a>. The petition would set out that a proposed Bill was of such
national importance that the will of the people of Ireland should be found out
before it became law. </p>

<p>The joint petition must be passed by the majority of the members of the
Seanad and one-third of the members of the Dáil. When the President receives
the petition, he/she must consult the Council of State. </p>

<p>If the President decides that the Bill contains a proposal of such national
importance that the will of the people should be found out, he/she will refuse
to sign the Bill until a referendum has been held. </p>

<p>The referendum must be held within 18 months of the President's decision not
to sign the Bill. This referendum gives the people of Ireland a chance to
decide whether the Bill should become part of Irish law.</p>

<p>The voting procedure at the ordinary referendum is the same as in a <a shape="rect" href="constitutional_referendum_in_ireland.html">constitutional
referendum</a>, except that the proposal is deemed to have been vetoed by the
people if: </p>
<ul><li>The majority of the votes cast are against the Bill and </li>
  <li>Those votes make up at least one-third of the presidential electors on
    the register of electors.</li>

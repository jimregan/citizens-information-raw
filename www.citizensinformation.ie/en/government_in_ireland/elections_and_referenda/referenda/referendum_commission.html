<p>A new referendum commission is set up for each new referendum that takes
place, if the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government
makes a ministerial order to appoint a commission. </p>

<p>The primary role of a referendum commission is to explain the subject matter
of referendum proposals, to promote public awareness of the referendum and to
encourage the electorate to vote at the poll.</p>

<p>Each referendum commission prepares independent and unbiased information
about the referendum and makes that information available to the public. The
commission publishes and distributes leaflets and brochures giving general
information about the referendum. It prepares a statement or statements on the
main issues and it may include any other information which it considers
appropriate. It also promotes debate and discussion about the referendum and
may also advertise the referendum in the media.</p>

<p>It may use television, radio, press, outdoor and cinema advertising and any
other media over the weeks in advance of the referendum to give general
information about the issues involved. The television broadcasts are subtitled
and a special video of the information booklet is produced in Irish sign
language and is distributed to members of the deaf community. The commission's
information booklets are also produced in Braille and audiotape for
distribution to people with visual impairments.</p>

<p>The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government may
establish a referendum commission after (and not before) the date on which a <a href="constitutional_referendum_in_ireland.html">Constitution Amendment
Bill</a> is initiated in Dáil Éireann. In the case of an <a href="ordinary_referendum.html">"ordinary referendum"</a>, the Minister may
establish a referendum commission no later than the date of the order
appointing polling day. </p>

<p>A referendum commission comprises a chairperson who must be a former Supreme
Court judge or a serving or former High Court judge nominated by the Chief
Justice; the Comptroller and Auditor General; the Ombudsman; and the Clerks of
the Dáil and the Seanad.</p>

<p>The referendum commission must carry out its functions in a way that is fair
to everyone concerned. </p>

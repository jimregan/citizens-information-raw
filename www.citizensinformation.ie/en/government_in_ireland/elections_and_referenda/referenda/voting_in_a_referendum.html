<p>If you are listed on the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.checktheregister.ie/">Register of Electors in Ireland,</a> a
polling card will be sent to your home before the referendum date. Your polling
card will include your elector number and will tell you where you can vote. It
will also include a formal statement explaining what the referendum is about.
</p>

<p>You can see a copy of the bill containing the proposal to amend the
Constitution on the <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/bills28/bills/default.htm&amp;m=b">Oireachtas
website</a>. You may also receive information about the referendum from the <a shape="rect" href="referendum_commission.html">Referendum Commission</a>.</p>

<p>On the day of the referendum, you must go to the polling station stated on
your polling card. There will be information available at the polling station
explaining what the referendum is about. You will be given a ballot paper. </p>

<p>Voting is by secret ballot. Your ballot paper will contain short
instructions on how to vote and will show the title of bill proposing to amend
the Constitution. Your ballot paper will ask you whether you approve of the
passing of the bill. You must mark "X" in either the "yes" or the "no" box on
your ballot paper. You may fold your ballot paper to hide how you voted and
place it in a sealed ballot box. You may only vote once at a referendum.</p>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/si/537/made/en/print">Electoral
Regulations 2016 (SI 537/2016)</a> a ballot paper template is available to
allow voters with visual impairments to mark their ballot papers at a
referendum without assistance.</p>
</div>
When all the votes are tallied, the referendum returning officer will announce
the <a shape="rect" href="referendum_result_in_ireland.html">referendum
result</a>. <div class="topic base_rules">

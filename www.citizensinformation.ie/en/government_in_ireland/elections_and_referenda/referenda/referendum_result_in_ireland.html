<h2>Information</h2>

<p>The following information explains how referendum results are collated. </p>

<p>The day after the poll, the ballot boxes will be opened at a designated
count centre in each constituency. The votes for and against the proposed
amendment will be counted and the local returning officer will report the
result to the referendum returning officer. </p>

<p>When the referendum returning officer has received all of the results from
all of the constituencies, they will draw up a provisional referendum
certificate stating the overall result of the voting. The certificate will also
state whether the proposed amendment has been approved by the people. </p>

<p>The provisional certificate will be published in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irisoifigiuil.ie/">Irish Oifiguil</a> (the Official Gazette).
If you wish to challenge the provisional certificate, you must present a
petition to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/high_court.html">High Court</a> within 7 days of
the publication of the provisional certificate. If no petition in presented to
the High Court, the certificate becomes final. </p>

<p>If the final certificate shows that the majority of the votes cast were in
favour of the proposal to amend the Constitution, the Bill is signed by the <a shape="rect" href="../../the_president/president_introduction_to_the_president_of_ireland.html">Irish
President</a> and the Constitution is then amended. </p>

<p>The Irish Government cannot introduce legislation in Ireland that conflicts
with Bunreacht na hEireann (the basic law or <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Constitution</a>
of the country). Sometimes it is necessary therefore, to change or amend the
Constitution. </p>

<p>Each time the Government wishes to change or amend the Constitution, it must
do it by holding a referendum. A referendum gives the people of Ireland the
opportunity to express their opinion and vote for or against the proposed
change or amendment.</p>

<p>In order to call a constitutional referendum, a proposal to amend the
Constitution must be introduced in the <a shape="rect" href="../../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/dail_eireann.html">Dáil</a>
as a Bill. The Bill sets out the proposed amendment to the Constitution. The
Bill must be passed by both the Dáil and the <a shape="rect" href="../../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/the_seanad.html">Seanad</a>.
</p>

<p>The Bill is then submitted to the people so that they can <a shape="rect" href="voting_in_a_referendum.html">vote</a> for or against it. If the majority
of the votes cast at the referendum are in favour of the change, the Bill is
signed by the <a shape="rect" href="../../the_president/president_introduction_to_the_president_of_ireland.html">Irish
President</a> and the Constitution is then amended. Read more about the <a shape="rect" href="../../the_president/president_of_ireland_and_legislation.html">President

of referenda</a> is available on the Department of the Taoiseach's website.</p>

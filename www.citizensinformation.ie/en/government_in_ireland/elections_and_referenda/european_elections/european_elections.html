<p>Direct elections to the <a shape="rect" href="../../european_government/eu_institutions/european_parliament.html">European
Parliament</a> are held every 5 years. The first direct elections were held in
1979. European Parliament elections take place within a 4-day period, normally
in the month of June, all over the European Union. The Minister for
Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government appoints a returning officer for
the "polling day" and the "polling period", which must be at least 12 hours
between 8.00 a.m. and 10.30 p.m. The 2014 elections take place on Friday, 23
May 2014.</p>

<p>There are 766 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) elected by voters in
28 EU member states, since Croatia joined the EU in July 2013. Following on
from the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:181:0057:0058:EN:PDF">European
Council Decision of 28 June 2013 (2013/312/EU) (pdf)</a>, after the 2014
election there will be 751MEPs. Ireland's MEP representation is reduced to 11
MEPs. </p>

<p>For the 2014 elections, Ireland is reducing the number of constituencies
from 4 to 3: Dublin, which elects 3 MEPs, Midlands-North-West and South which
will each elect 4 MEPs. This follows the <a href="http://www.constituency-commission.ie/ep/ep-report.html">report of the
European Parliament Constituencies Committee</a> in 2013.</p>

<p>Responsibility for conducting the election in each of the constituencies
rests with a returning officer appointed by the Minister for Housing, Planning,
Community and Local Government. He or she must be a County Registrar or a City
or County Sheriff. There are also local returning officers who are responsible
for taking the poll from the many polling stations in each county and city. </p>

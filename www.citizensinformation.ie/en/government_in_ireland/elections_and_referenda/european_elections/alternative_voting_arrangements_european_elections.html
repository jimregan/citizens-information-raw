<p>The following people may vote by post in a European Parliament election:</p>
<ul><li>Members of An Garda Siochana </li>
  <li>Members of the Defence Forces </li>
  <li>Civil servants and their spouses attached to Irish missions abroad </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../voting/facilities_for_voters_with_disabilities.html">Electors
    living at home who are unable to vote at a polling station due to a
    physical illness or disability</a> </li>
  <li>Full-time students registered at home who are living elsewhere while
    attending an educational institution in the State</li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../voting/registering_to_vote.html">Prisoners
    detained as a result of an order of a court</a> </li>
</ul><p>To vote by post, a ballot paper will be posted to you at your home. You must
arrange to have a declaration of identity witnessed by a Garda before marking
the ballot paper in the Garda station and returning it by post to the returning
officer. </p>

<p>Special voting arrangements apply to electors living in hospitals, nursing
homes or similar institutions who are unable to vote due to a physical illness
or disability. The ballot paper is brought to them in the institution and they
vote in the presence of a special presiding officer accompanied by a Garda.</p>

<p>Electors with physical disabilities who have difficulty in gaining access to
their local polling station may be allowed to vote at a more accessible station
in the constituency.</p>

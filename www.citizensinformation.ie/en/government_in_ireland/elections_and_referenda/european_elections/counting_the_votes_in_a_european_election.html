<p>The result of a European election cannot be declared until voting throughout
the European Union is completed.</p>

<p>The ballot papers are sent to the count centre for each constituency. The
candidate’s agents are allowed to supervise the count. Each ballot box is
opened and the number of ballot papers in each box is checked against the
return furnished by the presiding officer. All the ballot papers are then mixed
and sorted. Invalid papers are rejected.</p>

<p>Counting continues until all the seats have been filled. The returning
officer may recount all or any of the papers at any stage of a count. A
candidate or their agent is entitled to ask for a recount of the papers.</p>

<p>When the count is completed, the returning officer declares the results of
the election. The result cannot be declared until polling has closed in every
EU member state.</p>

<p>The electoral system is <a shape="rect" href="../voting/proportional_representation.html">proportional
representation</a> with single transferable vote (PR-STV).</p>

<p>The first step in the process is that the quota is worked out. The quota is
the minimum number of votes necessary to guarantee the election of a candidate.
It is calculated by dividing the total number of valid papers by one more than
the number of seats to be filled and adding one to the result. For example, if
there are 1,000 valid ballot papers and there are 4 seats in the constituency,
the quota is 1000 ÷ 4 +1 = 200 + 1 = 201. The quota is 201.</p>

<p>The ballot papers are sorted according to the first preferences recorded for
each candidate and counted. At the end of the first count, any candidate who
has received the quota of votes or more than the quota of votes is deemed to be
elected.</p>

<p>When a candidate receives more than the quota of votes, their surplus of
votes is proportionally transferred to the remaining candidates. </p>

<p>If no candidate receives more than the quota of votes or if the surplus is
not enough to elect one of the candidates, the candidate with the lowest amount
of votes is eliminated. Their papers are then transferred to the remaining
candidates according to the next preference shown on them.</p>

<p>If a ballot paper is to be transferred and the second preference shown on it
is for a candidate already elected or eliminated, the vote passes on to third
choice and so on. </p>

<p>If it gets to the point that the number of seats left to be filled is equal
to the number of candidates still in the running, these candidates are declared
elected without having obtained the quota. </p>

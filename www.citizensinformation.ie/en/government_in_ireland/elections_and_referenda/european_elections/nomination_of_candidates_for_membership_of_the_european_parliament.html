<p>In order to be nominated for election of the <a shape="rect" href="../../european_government/eu_institutions/european_parliament.html">European
Parliament</a>, you may either nominate yourself or one elector for the
constituency may nominate you. </p>

<p>You must complete a "nomination paper" and present it to the returning
officer for your constituency. If you wish, you may state your party
affiliation on your nomination paper. If you are not a member of an Irish
political party but you are member of a political group in the European
Parliament, you may have the name of that group included on all ballot papers
and notices. You may also submit a photograph and/or a political party emblem
to appear on the ballot paper. </p>

<p>If you are not an Irish or U.K. citizen, you must also make a statutory
declaration and produce an attestation from your home Member State that you are
not disqualified from standing as a candidate there. </p>

<p>The returning officer must decide on the validity of your nomination paper
within one hour after it is presented to him or her. He or she will object to
your name (or description) if</p>
<ul><li>it is not the name by which you are commonly known </li>
  <li>it is misleading or likely to cause confusion </li>
  <li>it is unnecessarily long or </li>
  <li>it contains a political reference. </li>
</ul><p>You must change the particulars on the nomination paper if the returning
officer raises an objection. The returning officer must hold that your
nomination paper is valid if it is properly filled out and signed. In the case
of a national of a Member State other than Ireland or the U.K, the returning
officer may refuse to hold the paper valid if it is not accompanied by the
necessary declaration and attestation regarding eligibility to stand.</p>

<p>As a candidate at a European Parliament election, you are entitled to send
one election letter free of postage charge to every elector in the
constituency. If you are a member of a political party with another candidate
in the constituency, you will only be allowed one election letter free of
postage charge between you.</p>

<p>There are no by-elections for the European Parliament. If an MEP dies or
resigns, the vacancy is filled from a replacement list. </p>

<p>A replacement list is a list of those candidates eligible for election as
members of the European Parliament. Before the close of nominations for a
European election, each registered political party or independent candidate may
present to the returning officer a list of replacement candidates. </p>

<p>Registered political parties may submit a list with up to 6 names more than
the number of candidates presented for election by that party in that
constituency.</p>

<p>The replacement list for a non-party or independent candidate in any
constituency may contain up to 4 names.</p>

<p>A person cannot be nominated as a replacement candidate in more than one
constituency. However, a person who is actually a candidate in the election can
also be a replacement candidate. This means that a candidate who was not
elected but who was also in the replacement list may be eligible to fill any
casual vacancies that arise.</p>

<p>In the <a shape="rect" href="european_elections.html">European Parliament
election</a>, the ballot papers will refer to the replacement list for each
candidate. The replacement lists are also displayed at each polling station.
</p>

<p>If an MEP dies or resigns, the person who is at the top of his or her
replacement list and is willing to become an MEP fills the vacancy. If there is
no list, there are no replacements left or those on the list are unwilling or
ineligible to become MEPs, <a shape="rect" href="../../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/dail_eireann.html">DÃ¡il
Eireann</a> may select a person to fill the vacancy from the replacement lists
presented for that constituency at the European Parliament election before the
last European Parliament election. </p>

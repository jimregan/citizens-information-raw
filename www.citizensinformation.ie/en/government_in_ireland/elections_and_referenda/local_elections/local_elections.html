<p>Local elections are held in Ireland every 5 years in the month of May or
June. The 2014 elections will be held on 23 May 2014. At these elections,
members of the local community elect Councillors to represent the community in
local authorities. At present, there are over 3 million local government
electors in Ireland. </p>

<p>The number of Councillors that may be elected to each local authority
changes from area to area. </p>

<p>The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government may divide
each city or county area into smaller local electoral areas and may fix the
number of Councillors that can be elected for each of these electoral areas.
</p>

<p>The polling date is fixed by an order of the Minister for Housing, Planning,
Community and Local Government and is the same day in all of the local
authority areas. The polling period must last at least 12 hours between 7.00 am
and 10.30 pm.</p>

<p>The responsibility for conducting the election lies with the secretary or
clerk of <a shape="rect" href="../../local_and_regional_government/local_authorities.html">each local
authority</a> who acts as the returning officer. Each local authority pays the
cost of running the election.</p>

<p>There is a week for nominating candidates to stand at local election; this
takes place 4 weeks before the polling day</p>

<p>On the polling day, voters may vote by secret ballot in their local polling
station. The electoral system is based on <a shape="rect" href="../voting/proportional_representation.html">proportional
representation</a> with single transferable vote. </p>

<p>If a candidate is elected to more than one local authority area, he or she
must declare in writing which area he or she wishes to represent within 3 days
of the public notice of the results of the election. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You <span>do not</span> have to be an Irish citizen to vote in a local
election.</p>

<p>You <span>must be</span> over 18 years of age and you must live in the local
electoral area. </p>

<p>You <span>must be registered on the Register of Electors</span> compiled
every year by County and City Councils. You can find out more about <a shape="rect" href="../voting/registering_to_vote.html">registering to vote</a>.

<h3>Local election posters and signs</h3>

<p>The law in Ireland forbids the putting up of posters/signs on poles or other
structures in public places unless you have the written permission of the owner
of the pole or other structure in advance of putting up the posters/signs.
Local authorities also have the power to remove these items should they
disintegrate or cause a litter nuisance. </p>

<p>Following an election, a party/candidate<span>must remove posters</span>
within a <span>seven day period</span>. After that date, an on-the-spot fine of
â‚¬150 is issued by your local authority in respect of each offence. Your local
authority will remove the poster and issue a fine. <br></p>

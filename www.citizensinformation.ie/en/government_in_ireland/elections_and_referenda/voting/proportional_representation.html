<p>The system of voting in all <a shape="rect" href="../national_elections/the_general_election.html">Dáil elections</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../national_elections/seanad_elections.html">Seanad
elections</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../national_elections/presidential_election.html">Presidential
elections</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../european_elections/european_elections.html">European elections</a> and
<a shape="rect" href="../local_elections/local_elections.html">local
elections</a> is proportional representation with a single transferable vote
(PR-STV) in multi-seat constituencies (3-, 4- and 5-seat constituencies at
Dáil elections). </p>

<p>Proportional representation means that as a voter, you can indicate your
first and subsequent choices for the candidates on the ballot paper.</p>

<p>The names of the candidates will appear in alphabetical order on the ballot
paper, together with their photographs and their party emblem (if they wish).

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Voting by proportional representation</h3>

<p>You indicate your first choice by writing 1 opposite your first choice and 2
opposite your second choice, 3 opposite your third choice and so on. You may
stop marking your paper after 1 or any subsequent preference or you may go
right down the ballot paper until a preference has been given to all candidates
ending with the candidate of your lowest choice. </p>

<p>When you vote like this, you are instructing the returning officer to
transfer your vote to the second choice candidate if your first choice is
either elected with a surplus of votes over the quota or is eliminated. If your
second choice is elected or eliminated, your vote may be transferred to your
third choice and so on. </p>

<h3>Counting the votes</h3>

<p>When polling is over, all the ballot boxes are taken to a central counting
place for each constituency. The count starts at 9am on the day after polling
day. The ballot papers are then sorted into piles of ballot papers for each
candidate. </p>

<p>The ballot papers are mixed, counted and sorted and spoiled papers are
rejected. A paper is spoiled if it does not have an official stamp, if it does
not indicate a clear choice, for example, if you have indicated No. 1 twice on
the paper, or if anything is written on the ballot paper by which the voter can
be identified. The total valid poll therefore, is the total number of votes
minus the number of spoiled papers. </p>

<h3>The quota</h3>

<p>When the papers have been counted and sorted, the quota is calculated by
dividing the Total Valid Poll by one more than the number of seats to be
filled, ignoring any remainder and then adding 1 vote. For example, in a Dáil
election in a 4-seat constituency with 50,000 votes cast, 50,000 divided by 4
plus 1 (that is, 5) = 10,000; 10,000 plus 1 is 10,001. This is the quota of
votes to be reached by the candidates and it means that only 4 persons can be
elected.</p>

<h3>Surplus votes</h3>

<p>If a candidate receives more than the quota on any count, the surplus ballot
papers are transferred to the remaining candidates in proportion to the next
available preferences indicated by voters (that is, the next preference on each
ballot paper for a candidate who has not been elected or eliminated). For
example, if candidate A receives 900 votes more than the quota on the first
count and on examining all of candidate A's ballot papers, it is found that 30%
of these have next available preferences for candidate B, then candidate B does
not get 30% of all candidate A's ballot papers (quota plus surplus), instead
candidate B gets 30% of A's surplus, that is, 270 ballot papers (30% of
900).</p>

<p>Where a candidate is elected at the second or at later count, only the
ballot papers that brought them over the quota are examined in the surplus
distribution, that is, the parcel of ballot papers last transferred to the
elected candidate. </p>

<p>If 2 or more candidates exceed the quota at the same time, the larger
surplus is distributed first. The surplus must be distributed if it can elect a
candidate or save the lowest candidate from elimination or qualify a candidate
for recoupment of their election expenses or deposit (if applicable).</p>

<p>Where there is no surplus for distribution or the distribution of the
surplus is prohibited, the next step is the elimination of the lowest
candidate. Two or more of the lowest candidates must be excluded together where
it is clear that they cannot possibly be saved from elimination in the long
run. Where a candidate is eliminated, all of their votes are transferred to the
next available preferences on them. </p>

<p>Counting continues until all the seats have been filled. The last seat can
be filled either by a candidate(s) exceeding the quota or by a candidate(s)
being elected without reaching the quota because it is clear that they are
ultimately going to be elected. Thus, if the number of seats left to be filled
is just one less than the number of candidates still in the running and an
available surplus cannot bring the lowest candidate level with or above the
second lowest candidate, all the candidates, except the one with the lowest
number of votes, are deemed elected even though none of them have actually
reached the quota. </p>

<h3>Recouping election expenses</h3>

<p>Candidates at most elections qualify for recoupment of their election
expenses (up to a maximum of €8,700 at a Dáil election), provided the number
of votes they receive at the count exceeds one-quarter of the quota. There are
extra count rules that are designed to give candidates every chance of reaching
this vote threshold. The threshold is calculated differently at a bye-election
so that the minimum number of votes required to qualify for recoupment of
elections expenses at a general election and at a bye-election in the same
constituency is broadly comparable. </p>

<h3>Recounts</h3>

<p>Candidates can ask for a recount of a particular count or of the entire
count. A recount of a particular count involves examining all papers relevant
to that count and moving papers to correct any errors. A complete recount
generally occurs only towards the end of the entire count and involves checking
all the votes as they stand (without moving any of them) to ensure that each is
credited to the correct candidate and that each parcel of papers contains the
correct number of papers. Any errors are noted and when the checking is
completed, the cumulative effect of all the errors is analysed. The returning
officer confirms the results already announced unless a significant error (that
is, one likely to result in a different candidate being elected or excluded) is
uncovered, in which case the votes are counted afresh at the point from which
the error occurred. </p>

<p>When the count is completed, the returning officer declares the results of
the election. </p>

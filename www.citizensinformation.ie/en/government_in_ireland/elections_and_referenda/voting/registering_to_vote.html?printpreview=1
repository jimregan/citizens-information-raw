<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>In order to vote in an <a shape="rect" href="../">election or referendum</a>
in Ireland, you must be registered to vote.</p>

<p>Being registered to vote means that you can participate in deciding who
represents you at <a shape="rect" href="../../local_and_regional_government/">local government level</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../../national_government/">national government level</a>
and <a shape="rect" href="../../european_government/">European government
level</a>. <br></p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="la1d07">The Register of Electors</h2>

<p>Every local authority in Ireland is responsible for compiling and publishing
a list of voters in its area. This is called the Register of Electors or the
Electoral Register. Anyone can inspect this Register and it is available in all
<a shape="rect" href="../../local_and_regional_government/local_authorities.html">local
authority</a> offices, post offices, Garda stations and <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/recreational_activities_in_ireland/sport_and_leisure/public_library_services.html">public
libraries</a>. You can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.checktheregister.ie">check to see if you are on the Electoral
Register here</a>. </p>

<p>The published Register contains the voter's name, address, polling station
and category of voter. For inclusion in the Register of Electors you must
complete application form RFA which is available from your local authority, to
whom it must be returned. When the register is being compiled, the application
form is available to download at <a href="http://www.checktheregister.ie/PublicPages/AppForms.aspx">checktheregister.ie</a>.
 </p>

<p>A new draft Register is compiled each year and is published on 1 November.
</p>

<p>To be eligible to be included in the Register of Electors, you must: </p>
<ul><li>Be at least 18 years old on the day the Register comes into force (15
    February) </li>
  <li>Have been ordinarily resident in the State on 1 September in the year
    preceding the coming into force of the Register. </li>
</ul><p>Students living away from home while attending college have the choice of
being registered at either their home address or their student residential
address. You must be registered at one address only and you must live at that
address on 1 September before the register comes into force. If you live away
from the address at which you are registered, you will need to contact the
registration authority and give them your new address.If you leave your address
but you plan to return there within 18 months, you can continue to be
registered there, as long you do not register at any other address.</p>

<h2>Correcting your details in the draft Register </h2>

<p>If you need to add your name or change your entry in the draft Register, you
can do this up to 25 November each year. You must fill in form RFA1 for the
draft Register. You can get an RFA1 form from your local post office or public
library. Forms are also available from your <a shape="rect" href="../../local_and_regional_government/local_authorities.html">local
authority</a> and this is where completed forms should be returned to. The form
is also available to download at that time at <a href="http://www.checktheregister.ie/PublicPages/AppForms.aspx">checktheregister.ie</a>.</p>

<p>If you are applying because you have moved to a new address, you should
include this information and your former address so that you can be removed
from the register for that area. </p>

<p>The amended Register of Electors is published on 1 February and comes into
force on 15 February. </p>

<h2>The supplement to the Register of Electors </h2>

<p>If your name is not on the Register of Electors in February, you may still
make an <a shape="rect" href="http://www.checktheregister.ie/PublicPages/AppForms.aspx">application to
be included in a supplement to the Register on form RFA2</a>. You can make this
application at any time, but in order to be included in the supplement used at
an election, your application must be received by your local authority at least
15 days before polling day (Sundays, public holidays and Good Friday are not
counted as days for this purpose).</p>

<p>You are eligible for inclusion in the supplement to the Register of Electors
on or after the day on which you reach 18 years of age. You can be included if
this birthday falls after the closing date for applications but is on or before
polling day. If you are within this category, you should accompany your
application with a copy of your <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/after_your_baby_is_born/registering_birth_your_baby.html">birth
certificate</a>. </p>

<p>You can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.checktheregister.ie/PublicPages/AppForms.aspx">apply for
inclusion on the supplement as a result of changing address on form RFA3</a>.
This will also remove you from the register for your previous address. </p>

<p></p>

<h2>The Electoral Register and direct marketing </h2>

<p>Local authorities publish two versions of the Register of Electors: the full
register and the edited register. </p>

<p>The <em>Full Register</em> lists everyone who is entitled to vote. Once a
Full Register has been published, it can only be used for an electoral or other
statutory purpose. </p>

<p>The <em>Edited Register</em> contains the names and addresses of those
voters who have indicated that their details can be used for other purposes
(for example, for direct marketing use by a commercial company or other
organisation). </p>

<p>If you do <strong>not </strong>want your details to be included in the
Edited Register, you should tick the "opt out" box on the registration form. If
you want your details to be included in the Edited Register, that is, you are
happy that commercial companies and other organisations will contact you with
direct marketing, you should leave the "opt out" box blank. </p>

<p>If you do not tick the "opt out" box, it is assumed that you want your
details to be included in the Edited Register, if you do not wish your details
to appear on the Edited Register tick the "opt out" box. </p>

<p>It is an offence for an organisation/commercial body to contact someone from
the full electoral register for direct marketing purposes. This was set down in
law under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0038/sec0032.html#partii-sec32">Section
32</a> of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0038/index.html">Electoral
(Amendment) Act 2001</a>. Find out more about <a shape="rect" href="/en/consumer_affairs/telecommunications_and_postal_services/dealing_with_unsolicited_direct_marketing.html">how

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l862a3">Who can vote in elections and referenda?</h2>

<p>The type of election you can vote in depends on your citizenship.The
following people are eligible to vote:</p>
<ul><li>Irish citizens can vote in every election and referendum </li>
  <li>British citizens may vote at Dáil, European and local elections </li>
  <li>Other EU citizens may vote at European and local elections* </li>
  <li>Non-EU citizens can vote at local elections only. </li>
</ul><p>*If you are an EU citizen, other than an Irish or British citizen, and you
were not registered to vote in previous European elections in Ireland, you must
also complete a declaration, <a href="http://www.checktheregister.ie/PublicPages/AppForms.aspx">Form EP1</a>,
to guard against double voting in the election. The local council will register
you to vote in your local constituency and send the information in your
declaration to your home EU Member State. You can also get the form from your
local authority.</p>

<h2>Overseas voters </h2>

<p>If you are an Irish citizen living abroad you cannot register to vote, that
is, be added to the Register of Electors. The only exception to this is in the
case of Irish officials on duty abroad (and their spouses) who may register on
the postal voters list. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="leb892">Postal Voters List</h2>

<ul><li>An Irish diplomat or his/her spouse posted abroad </li>
  <li>A member of the Garda Síochána </li>
  <li>A whole-time member of the Defence Forces. </li>

    which is away from your home address where you are registered </li>
  <li>You are unable to vote at your polling station because of your occupation

    as a result of an order of a court. </li>
</ul><p>Applications for inclusion on the Postal Voters List must be received by 25

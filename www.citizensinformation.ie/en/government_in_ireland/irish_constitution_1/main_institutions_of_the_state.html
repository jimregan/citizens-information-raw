<h2>Information</h2>

<p>The <a href="constitution_introduction.html">Irish Constitution</a>
establishes and describes the main institutions of the State. The power to run
the State is divided into 3 separate powers: the legislative power, the
executive power, and the judicial power. </p>

<p>The legislative power is the power to make laws, that is, to introduce,
remove or change legislation. Articles 15 to 27 of the Constitution give this
power to the national parliament or the Oireachtas. The Oireachtas consists of

Éireann</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/the_seanad.html">Seanad
Éireann</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../the_president/">the President</a>.
</p>

<p>The executive power is the power to carry the laws into effect, that is, to
execute or carry out the laws with the assistance of a police force, a military
force and the civil service. Article 28 of the Constitution gives this power to
the Government, that is. the <a shape="rect" href="../national_government/the_irish_government/the_taoiseach.html">Taoiseach</a>,
the <a shape="rect" href="../national_government/the_irish_government/the_tanaiste.html">Tanaiste</a>
and the cabinet of Ministers. </p>

<p>The judicial power is the power to interpret and apply the law to disputes
and conflicts that arise between the State and the individual and disputes and
conflicts that arise between individuals. Articles 34 to 37 of the Constitution
give this power to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/courts.html">courts</a>.</p>

<p>The Constitution describes the office and the role of the <a shape="rect" href="../the_president/council_of_state.html">Council of State</a>, the <a shape="rect" href="../national_government/standards_and_accountability/comptroller_and_auditor_general.html">Comptroller
and Auditor General</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="../national_government/the_irish_government/the_attorney_general.html">Attorney
General</a>. The Constitution also provides for local government and addresses
the issue of international relations.</p>

<h2>Information</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons.html">Irish
Constitution</a> was enacted in 1937. It is the fundamental legal document that
sets out how Ireland should be governed through a series of 50 Articles. Every
part of the Constitution is set out in both the Irish and English language. The
Irish title of the Constitution is Bunreacht na hEireann. The Constitution
establishes the branches or organs of government, it establishes the courts and
it also sets out how those institutions should be run. The Constitution also
describes the fundamental rights of every Irish citizen.</p>

<p>One of the most important Articles of the Constitution is Article 15.4,
which states that the Oireachtas must not enact any law that is repugnant to
the Constitution and that any such law is invalid. This means that the
Constitution is superior to all other law. If a proposed new law is repugnant
to the Constitution, it cannot be enacted without first changing the
Constitution by a <a shape="rect" href="../elections_and_referenda/referenda/constitutional_referendum_in_ireland.html">constitutional
referendum</a>. The Constitution consists of 2 main parts. It describes:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="main_institutions_of_the_state.html">The main
    institutions of the State</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="constitution_fundamental_rights.html">The
    fundamental rights of the citizen</a> </li>
</ul><p>Read more about how an <a shape="rect" href="../elections_and_referenda/referenda/constitutional_referendum_in_ireland.html">amendment

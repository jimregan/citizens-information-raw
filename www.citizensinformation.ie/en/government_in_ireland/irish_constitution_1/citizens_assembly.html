<p>In July 2016, the <a href="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071300051?opendocument#YY00400">Oireachtas
passed a resolution</a> to establish a Citizens’ Assembly which is to
consider a limited number of issues. The Assembly has a time limit of one year
from the date of the first Assembly meeting for completion of its work. It held
its first meeting in October 2016.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="ld75c4">Assembly</h2>

<p>The Assembly comprises a <a href="http://www.merrionstreet.ie/en/News-Room/Releases/Government_appoints_Chairperson_to_Citizens_Assembly.html">chairperson
appointed by the Government</a> and 99 citizens entitled to vote in referenda
who were selected so as to be broadly representative of Irish society.
Substitutes can be appointed who are entitled to contribute to the proceedings
and vote in their own name. The Assembly agrees its own rules of procedure for
the conduct of its business.</p>

<p>The Assembly may invite and accept submissions from interested parties and
can seek such expert advice as it considers desirable. An expert advisory group
assists the work of the Assembly.</p>

<p>All matters before the Assembly are to be determined by a majority vote of
the members present and voting, other than the chairperson. The chairman has a
casting vote if the vote is tied.</p>

  <li>How we best respond to the challenges and opportunities of an ageing
    population</li>
  <li>Fixed-term parliaments</li>
  <li>The manner in which referenda are held</li>
  <li>How the State can make Ireland a leader in tackling climate change</li>
</ul><p>The first issue to be discussed is the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.

Oireachtas on each issue as soon as it has completed its deliberations on
it.</p>

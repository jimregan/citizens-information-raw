<p><a href="constitution_introduction.html">The Constitution</a> recognises
and declares that people living in Ireland have certain fundamental personal
rights. These rights are natural human rights and are confirmed and protected
by the Constitution. </p>

<p>Not every fundamental right that you possess is set out in the Constitution
- you have many personal rights that are not specifically stated in the
Constitution. These rights may be derived or implied from the Constitution. For
example, the Constitution does not specifically state a right to privacy but
the courts recognise that the personal rights in the constitution imply the
right to privacy.</p>

<p>Fundamental rights are not absolute - they can be limited or restricted by
the Oireachtas on the grounds, for example, of the common good or public order.
</p>

<p>Every constitutional right has the same status and value. If there is a
conflict between the constitutional rights of individuals, the courts will look
at all the circumstances and weigh all of the factors to decide which
constitutional right is more important in that particular case. </p>

<h2>Main Constitutional rights</h2>

<h4>Equality before the law</h4>

<p>All citizens in Ireland shall be held equal before the law. This means that
the State cannot unjustly, unreasonably or arbitrarily discriminate between
citizens. You cannot be treated as inferior or superior to any other person in
society simply because of your human attributes or your ethnic, racial, social
or religious background.</p>

<p>However, when the state is making laws, it may consider differences of
capacity and of social function between individuals in society.</p>

<h4>Right to life</h4>

<p>The Constitution specifically recognises and protects your right to life.</p>

<p>Your right to life also means the right to have nature take its course and
to die a natural death. That does not mean that you have the right to have your
life terminated or death accelerated. Your right to die is simply the right to
die a natural death and not to be kept alive by artificial means.</p>

<p>The right to life of the unborn was inserted into the Constitution by a
constitutional amendment in 1983. The equal right to life of the mother is also
protected. In 1992, two amendments were added to the Constitution; the right of
the mother to travel to another state and freedom of information in relation to
services available in another state.</p>

<h4>Personal liberty</h4>

<p>The Constitution guarantees that you have a right to liberty and freedom,
except in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>This means that, in general, you are entitled to your own personal freedom
but legislation may provide for your arrest and detention in certain
circumstances. The State may only breach your right to personal liberty in
circumstances that come within a law that provides for your arrest and/or
detention.</p>

<p>If you believe that you are being detained or held unlawfully, you may make
an application to the High Court. If the person or institution detaining you
cannot justify the detention or prove that it is lawful, the High Court may
order that you be released. This is called a <em>Habeas Corpus</em> order.</p>

<h4>Freedom of expression</h4>

<p>You have a right to freely express your convictions and opinions. However,
the Constitution asserts that the State should try to make sure that the radio,
the press and the cinema are not used to undermine public order or morality or
the authority of the State. It also states that it is an offence to publish or
utter blasphemous, seditious or indecent matter.</p>

<p>There are some limitations on your freedom of expression. For example, the
Censorship of Publications Acts and the Censorship of Films Acts allow
censorship of publications like books, films and DVDs.</p>

<h4>Freedom of assembly</h4>

<p>You have a right to assemble or meet peacefully and without weapons. This
right is limited by legislation to protect public order and morality. The law
prevents or controls meetings that are calculated or designed to cause a riot
or breach of the peace.</p>

<p>There are other limitations on your freedom of assembly. You cannot meet on
private property without the consent of the owner - that is trespass. Parades
and processions are not illegal but it is a public nuisance to obstruct a
highway. You may not hold a procession or meeting within half a mile of the
Oireachtas when it has been prohibited by the Gardaí or you have been asked to
disperse.</p>

<h4>Freedom of association</h4>

<p>The Constitution guarantees your right to form associations and unions. You
may form any type of association for whatever purpose you choose, whether it is
sporting, social, charitable, commercial or political.</p>

<p>This right is limited by legislation to protect public order and morality.
For example, associations formed for the purpose of treason or some
anti-constitutional or illegal purpose cannot rely on this right to freedom of
association.</p>

<h4>The right to fair procedures</h4>

<p>The courts, and all other bodies or persons making decisions that affect
you, must treat you fairly. There are two essential rules of fair procedure.</p>

<p>•The person making the decision that affects you should not be biased or
appear to be biased.</p>

<p>•You must be given an adequate opportunity to present your case. You must
be informed of the matter and you must be given a chance to comment on the
material put forward by the other side.</p>

<h4>Bodily integrity</h4>

<p>You have a right not to have your body or person interfered with. This means
that the State may not do anything to harm your life or health.</p>

<p>If you are in custody, you have a right not to have your health endangered
while in prison.</p>

<h4>Trial by jury</h4>

<p>Your right to trial by jury only exists in certain criminal cases.</p>

<p>If you have been charged with a "non-minor" offence, you will be tried by a
judge sitting with a jury. There are some offences for which you will be given
a choice - whether you want to have your case decided by a District Court Judge
sitting alone or by a judge sitting with a jury.</p>

<p>The jury must consist of non-lawyers who have been chosen at random from a
diverse range of jurors from the community.</p>

<h4>Religious liberty</h4>

<p>Your are free to practise your religion and your freedom of conscience. The
State guarantees not to endow or favour any religion and not to discriminate on
the grounds of religion.</p>

<p>State aid for schools cannot discriminate between schools of different
religious denominations. Every child has the right to attend a denominational
school receiving State funding without having to participate in religious
instruction in the school.</p>

<p>Your right to religious liberty may be limited to protect public order and
morality.</p>

<p><strong>The right to privacy</strong></p>

<p>The Constitution does not specifically state a right to privacy but the
courts recognise that the personal rights in the Constitution imply the right
to privacy.</p>

<p>For example, your private written communications and telephone conversations
cannot be deliberately, consciously and unjustifiably interfered with. However,
your right to privacy may be limited or restricted by legislation in the
interests of the common good, public order and morality.</p>

<h4>The right to earn a livelihood</h4>

<p>As a citizen, you have a right to work and to earn a living, whether you are
male or female.</p>

<p>The State is under a duty to protect your right to work and earn a
livelihood from unjust attack.</p>

<h4>Freedom to travel</h4>

<p>You have a right to move freely within the State. You also have a broader
right to travel and to obtain a passport for the purpose of travelling.</p>

<p>Your right to a passport may be restricted or limited. For example, before
granting you bail, a court may require that you agree to hand over your
passport. The State may also restrict your right to travel for the purposes of
national security.</p>

<h4>Inviolability of a citizen's dwelling</h4>

<p>The Constitution declares that the dwelling of a citizen is inviolable and
shall not be entered forcibly except in accordance with the law. This means
that no one, including the Gardaí, may enter the place where you live without
a warrant or other legal authority to enter.</p>

<p>If you are arrested as a result of an unlawful entry into your home, your
arrest is illegal. Evidence obtained as a result of an unlawful entry onto your
dwelling is inadmissible in court.</p>

<h4>Property rights</h4>

<p>The Constitution declares that the State will vindicate the property rights
of every cititizen. This means that you have a right to own, transfer and
inherit property. You also have the right to bequeath property upon your death.
The State guarantees to pass no law to abolish these rights. </p>

<p>Article 43 acknowledges that these rights ought to be regulated by the
principles of social justice. This means that the State may pass laws limiting
your right to private propety in the interests of the common good. If the state
passes a law that restricts your property rights, it may be required to
compensate you for this restriction.</p>

<p>Examples of restrictions or limitations on your right to own property
include town and regional planning, protection of national monuments,
compulsory acquisition of land and property taxes.</p>

<h4>The rights of the family</h4>

<p>The family founded on marriage possesses a collection of constitutional
rights. These include:</p>
<ul><li>The right to marital privacy. This means that couples may make their own
    decisions about family planning. </li>
  <li>The right to consort together, to enjoy each other's company and to
    procreate. This right may be limited or restricted where a family member is
    in prison or where one spouse is not an Irish citizen. You can read <a href="../../justice/prison_system/prisoners_rights.html">more about
    prisoners' rights here</a>.</li>
  <li>The right of parents to be the main and natural educators of their
    children. The State must respect your right as parents to provide for the
    religious, moral, intellectual, physical and social education of your
    children. The State cannot oblige you to send your children to school or to
    any particular type of school but it may require that children receive a
    certain minimum education.</li>
  <li>The right to free primary education - this means that the State must pay
    for your children's primary education. State aid for schools must not
    discriminate between schools of different religions.</li>
  <li>The right to decide the religion of your children. The State cannot
    interfere with this right.</li>
</ul><p>There is a constitutional principle that married parents have equal rights
to and are joint guardians of their children. If the parents separate or
divorce, the courts may decide who will have custody of the children. The
paramount consideration is the welfare of the children. </p>

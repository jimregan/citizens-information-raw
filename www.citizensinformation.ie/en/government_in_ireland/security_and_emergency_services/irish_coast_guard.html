<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dttas.ie/maritime/english/irish-coast-guard-ircg">Irish Coast
Guard</a> is a division of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. It
has responsibility for the national system of marine communications,
surveillance and emergency management in Ireland's <em>Exclusive Economic Zone
(EEZ)</em> and certain inland waterways. (An EEZ is the sea zone over which a
country claims exclusive rights for fishing, drilling, and other economic
activities.)</p>

<p>It is responsible for the response to maritime accidents which involves:</p>
<ul><li>Search and rescue</li>
  <li>Counter pollution and ship casualty operations</li>
</ul><p>It also has responsibility for vessel traffic monitoring.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l8f72f">Search and rescue</h2>

<h3>Marine rescue centres</h3>

<p>The main roles of the Irish Coast Guard are:</p>
<ul><li>To rescue people from danger at sea or on land</li>
  <li>To organise immediate medical transport</li>
  <li>To assist boats and ships within the country's jurisdiction</li>
</ul><p>It has marine rescue centres in Dublin, Malin Head (Co Donegal) and Valentia
Island (Co Kerry) which are responsible for coordinating search and rescue
operations in their areas of responsibility. The limits of the <a href="http://www.dttas.ie/maritime/ircg/searchrescue">Irish Marine Search and
Rescue Region</a> are approximately 200 miles off the west coast, 30 miles off
the south coast and dividing the Irish Sea. The centres maintain a
communications watch which includes a distress watch on the international VHF
distress frequency.</p>

<p>The rescue centres also broadcast maritime safety information which contains
navigation and weather warnings on VHF radio and, in some cases, MF radio in
accordance with published schedules.</p>

<h3>Coast Guard units</h3>

<p>The Irish Coast Guard has about 50 <a href="http://www.dttas.ie/maritime/ircg/volresteams">coast guard units</a>
positioned at strategic locations around the coastline and on inland waterways.
They are staffed by volunteers and are equipped to carry out search, cliff and
coastal rescue.</p>

<p>In addition to the coast guard units, the Irish Coast Guard can also use as
a resource for search and rescue:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://rnli.org/aboutus/lifeboatsandstations/Pages/lifeboats-and-lifeboat-stations.aspx">RNLI
    lifeboats</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.iws.ie/rescue-services/community-rescue-boats-ireland-crbi.302.html">Community
    rescue boats</a></li>
</ul><h3>Coast Guard helicopters</h3>

<p>The Irish Coast Guard operates search and rescue helicopters from Dublin,
Waterford, Shannon and Sligo. They respond to emergencies at sea and on inland
waterways, offshore islands and mountains (32 counties).</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="leeb1c">Radio medical advice service</h2>

<p>The Irish Coast Guard also provides a radio medical advice service. If a
vessel makes a call on either VHF or MF radio, or a telephone call requiring
medical advice or assistance, it is provided with a radio or telephone link to
<a href="http://www.emed.ie/Administration/Medico/About_Medico.php">Medico
Cork</a> in Cork University Hospital or to a foreign medico centre. If the
medical advice requires that the casualty be taken off the vessel, the marine
rescue centre providing the link arranges for the casualty to be transported
from the vessel to a hospital.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l2cbd8">Marine pollution</h2>

<p>The Irish Coast Guard has a role with regard to the protection of the ocean
and the coasts against pollution. In the case of an imminent pollution
accident, it has the right to intervene in ships operation.</p>

<p>The Coast Guard’s National Maritime Operations Centre based in Dublin
coordinates the response to <a href="http://www.dttas.ie/maritime/ircg/pollution">marine pollution
incidents</a> within the EEZ.</p>
</div>

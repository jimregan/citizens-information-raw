<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>A major emergency is an incident beyond the normal capabilities of the
principal emergency services, which causes or threatens:</p>
<ul><li>Death or injury,</li>
  <li>Serious disruption of essential services or</li>
  <li>Damage to property, the environment or infrastructure</li>
</ul><p>Such events include explosions, train crashes, incidents involving hazardous
substance and forms of severe weather such as flooding and storms.</p>

<p>A major emergency requires the mobilisation of additional resources by the
principal response agencies to ensure an effective response.</p>

<h3>Principal emergency services</h3>

<p>The principal emergency services are the first services to respond to most
major emergencies. They are the blue light services that respond to normal
emergencies, that is, the <a href="../../justice/law_enforcement/garda_siochana_national_police_force.html">Garda
Síochána</a>, the <a href="../../health/health_system/emergency_health_services_in_ireland.html">Ambulance
Service</a> and the <a href="fire_services.html">Fire Service</a>. A fourth
principal emergency service, the Irish Coast Guard, is responsible for handling
maritime emergencies in Irish territorial waters, harbours and coastline.</p>

<h3>Principal response agencies</h3>

<p>Principal response agencies (PRAs) are the agencies which have been
designated by Government to respond to major emergencies. They are the Garda
Síochána, the Health Service Executive and the local authorities. Each
principal emergency service is part of a larger PRA. For example, the Fire
Service is a local authority service. Due to the nature and complexity of major
emergencies, the staff and resources of the wider PRA are required to manage
the consequences of the major emergency event and to co-ordinate its response
with the other PRAs .</p>

<p>Depending on the nature of the emergency, agencies other than the PRAs such
as the Defence Forces or the voluntary emergency services may also be
required.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lba9da">Major emergency management</h2>

<p>Major emergencies require special arrangements to ensure a co-ordinated and
effective response by the PRAs.</p>

<h3>Framework for Major Emergency Management</h3>

<p>In 2006 the Government approved a <a href="http://mem.ie/">Framework for
Major Emergency Management</a> which is a framework of policies, structures and
arrangements for preparedness and response to major emergencies at the local
and regional levels. The purpose of the Framework is to enable divisions of the
Garda Síochána, regions of the Health Service Executive and local authorities
to prepare for and make a co-ordinated response to any major emergency which
occurs in their area.</p>

<p>The Framework sets out arrangements for other services such as the Defence
Forces, voluntary emergency services, utilities, transport companies,
industrial and other participants, and the affected communities to support and
work with the PRAs in reacting to and managing major emergencies.</p>

<p>Each PRA has a major emergency plan that sets out the detail of its
response, as well as its contribution to the combined response of all of the
agencies.</p>

<h3>Office of Emergency Planning</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.emergencyplanning.ie/_home.aspx">Office of Emergency
Planning</a> is responsible to the Minister for Defence for the co-ordination
and oversight of planning for emergencies. It also provides a support role to
the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning. It has published a handbook
entitled <a href="http://www.emergencyplanning.ie/downloads/Emergency-Handbook-English.pdf">Preparing
for Major Emergencies (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>Policy and direction is provided by the Government Task Force on Emergency
Planning which is chaired by the Minister for Defence. It co-ordinates and
oversees the emergency planning activities of all government departments and
public authorities. It also promotes the best possible use of resources and
compatibility across different planning requirements.</p>

<p>The Office of Emergency Planning chairs the Inter-Departmental Working Group
on Emergency Planning (IDWG) which carries out specific studies and develops
particular aspects of emergency planning. The IDWG is the means by which
expertise is shared between Government departments and public authorities on
emergency planning.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.emergencyplanning.ie/media/docs/revised%20annex%20to%20sepg%20-%20roles%20&amp;%20responsibilities%20in%20emergency%20planning%2027%20may2010.pdf">lead
responsibility for specific emergency planning functions</a> remains with the
relevant government departments. When an emergency occurs, the appropriate
emergency plan is set into operation with the relevant department taking the
lead in its implementation.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l72443">Severe weather</h2>

<p>Following severe weather events in the winters of 2009/2010 and 2010/2011
involving flooding and severe cold, the Government launched an information
campaign to provide advice and information to help the public be better
prepared to deal with a period of severe weather. The Office of Emergency
Planning has published a booklet entitled <a href="http://www.winterready.ie/pdfs/BeWinterReady-Web.pdf">Be Winter-Ready
(pdf)</a> and developed a website <a href="http://www.winterready.ie/">winterready.ie</a> to provide practical
advice and contact details of the main services that can provide help in
extreme weather-related emergencies.</p>

<p>The Department of Transport has issued a <a href="http://www.dttas.ie/sites/default/files/publications/corporate/english/transport-information-guide-during-severe-weather-2013-2014/transport-media-info-guide-severe-weather-2012-2013-final.pdf">guide
for severe weather (pdf)</a> which includes advice on travel during severe
weather as well as contact details for city and county councils, bus operators,
rail and ferry operators, airports and airlines.</p>

<p>The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has published a <a href="https://www.djei.ie/en/Publications/Publication-files/Forf%C3%A1s/Business-Continuity-Planning-in-Severe-Weather.pdf">guide
for businesses on preparing for severe weather (pdf)</a>. It includes a
practical checklist to provide businesses with a basic template which could
help identify weaknesses in their business continuity plans should a severe
weather event occur.</p>

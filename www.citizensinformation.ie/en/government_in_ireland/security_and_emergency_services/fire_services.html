<p>The Fire Services in Ireland are managed at local authority level, with the
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.environ.ie">Department of Housing, Planning,
Community and Local Government</a> playing an advisory, legislative and
policy-making role. The 30 fire services are operated by fire authorities,
which are managed by local authorities around the State. The staff of the fire
services runs 220 fire stations around the country and is made up of full-time
professional fire fighters and retained part-time staff. Retained staff, who
make up about two-thirds of the national total, are recruited in rural areas,
and are available for emergencies at all times. Cities and larger urban areas
are serviced by full-time fire fighters, who work in shifts to provide a
24-hour on call service. </p>

<h3>Funding</h3>

<p>The Fire Services in Ireland receive funding from 3 sources:</p>
<ul><li>The Government </li>
</ul><p>Each local authority receives a fund from the Government to operate a fire
service. This fund has replaced domestic rates. The Government also gives
funding to voluntary cave and mountain rescue groups and publishes the annual
fire statistics for the country. </p>
<ul><li>Commercial rates </li>
</ul><p>Local authorities collect annual rates (charges) from commercial premises.
These rates are designed to cover the cost of local authority services to
businesses, including the provision of fire services. </p>
<ul><li>Charges </li>
</ul><p>Local authorities are permitted under the Fire Services Acts to charge for
fire services and the majority of local authorities impose charges. For
example, some local authorities charge a flat fee for domestic fires like
chimney fires, and may seek the actual cost to them of commercial fires,
forestry fires, false alarms and instances that require the use of special
equipment. However, there is not a uniform set of fire services charged for or
a uniform set of charge rates.</p>

<p>Fire authorities also charge for fire service inspections. These charges can
vary between local authorities and can also vary with the nature of the
premises being inspected.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Fire safety</h3>

<p>The Department’s <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Community/NationalDirectorateforFireandEmergencyManagement/">National
Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management</a> has been assigned the
Department’s role in the promotion of fire safety and fire prevention on a
national level. It works closely with fire authorities around the country to
achieve this aim and also co-operates with the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue
Service. The main focus of promotional activities centres on the National Fire
Safety Week, which takes place in early October. </p>

<h3>Training</h3>

<p>Training is provided at national and at local level at centres around the
country. One of the functions of the National Directorate is to support the
training of fire services personnel. It operates an <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Community/NationalDirectorateforFireandEmergencyManagement/FireServiceTraining/">annual
training programme</a>.</p>

<p>The largest training centre in Ireland is the Dublin Fire Brigade Training
Centre, which offers courses in fire safety and fire safety management to
companies outside the fire services.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Fire service powers at the scene of a fire</h3>

<p>The Commanding Officer at the scene of an emergency is empowered by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1981/en/act/pub/0030/index.html">Fire
Services Act 1981</a> (as amended by Part 3 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0015/index.html">Licensing
of Indoor Events Act 2003</a>) to do or command his/her fire-fighters or other
personnel to do whatever is necessary or appropriate to put out the fire or
protect or rescue persons involved in the emergency. In the event of a fire or
a suspected fire, the Commanding Officer's powers include:</p>
<ul><li>The power to enter any property where there is reason to believe a fire
    has broken out </li>
  <li>The power to evacuate any building </li>
  <li>The power to demolish any building or part of a building </li>
  <li>The power to take a water supply from any public, private, natural or
    artificial source. </li>
</ul><p>Fire fighters are immune from legal action in the course of their duties
within the Act's provisions. </p>

<h3>Offences under the Fire Services Acts and Criminal Justice Act 2006</h3>

<p>Under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, it is an offence to:</p>
<ul><li>Knowingly give a false alarm to the fire services</li>
  <li>Interfere with or obstruct any water hydrant or other source of water
    supply</li>
</ul><p>The penalty for these offences can be a fine of up to €3,000 or a prison
sentence of up to 6 months or both.</p>

<p>More serious offences, such as contravening fire safety regulations in
relation to</p>
<ul><li>The size, design and use of buildings</li>
  <li>The provision of adequate fire escape facilities</li>
  <li>The maximum number of occupants allowed under the regulations</li>
</ul><p>may be punished on conviction on indictment with a fine of up to €130,000
or a prison sentence of up to 2 years or both.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0026/sec0185.html#sec185">Section
185 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006</a> makes it an offence to assault or
threaten to assault fire brigade personnel during the execution of their
duties. The penalty for this offence is a fine of up to €5,000 or 7 years in
prison (or both). It is also an offence to obstruct or impede fire brigade
personnel from carrying out their duties. This offence carries a fine of
€2,500 and/or 6 months in prison.</p>

<h3>Fire Safety Certificates</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/DevelopmentHousing/BuildingStandards/">Building
Control Regulations 1997 to 2013</a> provide, among other things, for a system
of Fire Safety Certificates to show that building designs comply with fire
safety requirements. Developers of every new building, with the exception of
domestic buildings, are required to obtain a Fire Safety Certificate. Although
there are different certificates for different kinds of development, it is
necessary for every developer to send their plans and designs to their local
fire authority.</p>

<p>Developers' plans are inspected by senior fire services staff who ensure
that adequate escape facilities are present and that the building is designed
in a way that prevents and limits the spread of a fire. If they are satisfied,
a certificate is then issued by the building control authority.</p>

<h3>Buildings inspection</h3>

<p>Under the provisions of the Fire Services Acts authorised inspectors from
the fire services can visit and inspect any building within their jurisdiction.
They may ask for any of the following details:</p>
<ul><li>The number of employees or occupants in the building</li>
  <li>The purpose of any room or area in the building</li>
  <li>The materials used in the building's construction</li>
  <li>Any official documents relating to the building's safety.</li>
</ul><p>The inspectors can also examine the water supply and are permitted to bring
any necessary equipment with them onto a site and examine or test any heating,
lighting or ventilation systems and any substances used or stored within a
premises.</p>

<p>Owners of property can be asked by a fire services inspector to provide
drawings or plans of buildings under their ownership. The owner is legally
obliged to provide a satisfactory response to the inspector. If the inspector
is not happy with what he or she finds, he/she can make an application to the
<a href="../../justice/courts_system/high_court.html">High Court</a> for an
order requiring the removal, alteration or making safe of any structure,
service, fitting or piece of equipment or an order restricting construction
work at the site or prohibiting the use of a building until the required
changes have been made. If the High Court grants such an order, its terms are
legally binding on the owner of the building or site. Offenders can face a fine
of up to €3,000 and/or up to six months imprisonment.</p>

<p>If a fire services inspector is refused entry, obstructed or impeded in his
or her duties, it is considered a criminal offence that is punishable by a fine
of up to €3,000 and/or six months imprisonment. A fire services inspector can
apply to the District Court for a warrant if he/she is refused entry to a
building or site.</p>

<h3>Licensing of petrol storage</h3>

<p>The fire services also have a role in ensuring compliance with the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1972/en/act/pub/0010/index.html">Dangerous
Substances Act, 1972</a> and <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1979/en/si/0311.html">Dangerous Substances
(Retail and Private Petroleum Stores) Regulations 1979 (SI 311 of 1979)</a>.
For example, those in possession of more than 273 litres of petrol must apply
for a licence for the storage of petrol. Applicants have to submit copies of <a href="http://www.osi.ie/">Ordnance Survey</a> maps of the area and architects'
plans of the site and any buildings on the site to their local authority. This
information is necessary so that the fire services can ensure that dangerous
substances, most commonly large amounts of petrol at petrol stations and
industrial sites, are stored safely and kept at a reasonable distance from
other buildings. There is <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Your_Industry/Petrol_Stations/Retail_and_Private_Petroleum_Stores_RPPS/">more
information on the Health and Safety Authority’s website</a>.</p>

<h3>Future developments</h3>

<p>In February 2013, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local
Government published a <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Community/NationalDirectorateforFireandEmergencyManagement/PolicyDocuments/">major
policy document for the fire services</a> entitled <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Community/FireandEmergencyServices/FileDownLoad,32381,en.pdf">Keeping
Communities Safe - a framework for fire safety in Ireland (pdf)</a>. It covers
a number of issues including reform of service delivery structures and the
roles of the fire services. The number of fire services is to be reduced from
the current 30 fire services to 21, based on developing and extending the
“shared services” approach already used by a number of fire authorities.</p>

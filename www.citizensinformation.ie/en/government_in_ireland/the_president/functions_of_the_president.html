<h2>Information</h2>

<p>The President is the Head of State, although they play a mainly ceremonial
role in the running of the State. The current President of Ireland is <a href="http://www.president.ie/biography/">Michael D. Higgins</a>, who commenced
his first term on 11 November 2011. </p>

addresses, both to the Oireachtas and to the public.</p>

<h2>Information</h2>

<p>If the President of Ireland is absent, becomes incapacitated, dies, resigns,
is <a shape="rect" href="inauguration_and_removal_of_the_president.html">removed from office</a>
or fails to perform their functions, the Presidential Commission steps in to
perform the functions of the President.</p>

<p>The Presidential Commission consists of the Chief Justice, the <a shape="rect" href="../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/ceann_comhairle.html">Ceann
Comhairle</a> (Chairperson) of the <a shape="rect" href="../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/dail_eireann.html">DÃ¡il</a>
and the <a shape="rect" href="../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/cathaoirleach_of_seanad_eireann.html">Cathaoirleach</a>
(Chairperson) of the <a shape="rect" href="../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/the_seanad.html">Seanad</a>.
If any of those people are unable to act, the President of the High Court, the
Leas (Deputy) Ceann Comhairle and the Leas (Deputy) Cathaoirleach,
respectively, can act as members instead.</p>

<p>Any 2 of the members of the Presidential Commission can perform the
functions of the President. The Presidential Commission frequently acts instead
of the President while they are abroad, for example, by signing <a shape="rect" href="../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/legislation.html">Bills</a>
into law. </p>

<p>The President's Award is the National Challenge Award given by the President
to young people in Ireland between the ages of 15 and 25 years. Recipients of
the award get a medal in a presentation box, a certificate signed by the
President and a lapel pin.</p>

<p>The purpose of the award is to reward young people who have set and achieved
a demanding challenge for themselves in each of 4 different areas of
activity:</p>
<ul><li>Community involvement, for example, helping older people or learning
    first aid or lifesaving</li>
  <li>Personal skill, for example, learning a musical instrument, computer
    skills or driving</li>
  <li>Physical recreation, for example, swimming, football or tennis</li>
  <li>Adventure journey, for example, a cycling, canoeing or hiking group
  trip.</li>
</ul><p>To achieve the top level of award you must also participate in a residential
project, for example, a residential Irish language course, a residential sports
course or work in a care home.</p>

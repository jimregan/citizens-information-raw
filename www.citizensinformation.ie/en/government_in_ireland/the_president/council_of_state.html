President. Before the President can exercise some of their <a shape="rect" href="functions_of_the_president.html">functions</a>, they must consult with
the Council of State. </p>

<p>The President must consult with the Council of State before they can convene
a meeting of one or both Houses of the Oireachtas. The President must also
consult with the Council of State in order to exercise some of their powers in
relation to legislation. The Council of State was established under Article 31
of Bunreacht na hEireann (the <a shape="rect" href="../irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Constitution</a>).</p>

<p>There are 3 categories of members of the Council of State:</p>

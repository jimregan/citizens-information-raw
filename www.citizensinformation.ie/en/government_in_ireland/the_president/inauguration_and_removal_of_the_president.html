<h3>Inauguration of the President</h3>

<p>The candidate who has won the <a shape="rect" href="../elections_and_referenda/national_elections/presidential_election.html">presidential
election</a> becomes President of Ireland by publicly making the following
oath. (This oath is set out in Bunreacht na hÉireann – the <a shape="rect" href="../irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Irish
Constitution.</a>) </p>

<p>"In the presence of Almighty God I do solemnly and sincerely promise and
declare that I will maintain the Constitution of Ireland and uphold its laws,
that I will fulfil my duties faithfully and conscientiously in accordance with
the Constitution and the law, and that I will dedicate my abilities to the
service and welfare of the people of Ireland. May God direct and sustain
me".</p>

<p>The President is inaugurated in St Patrick's Hall in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dublincastle.ie/">Dublin Castle</a> and makes the declaration
in the presence of members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Judges of the
<a shape="rect" href="../../../justice/courts_system/supreme_court.html">Supreme Court</a>, the
Court of Appeal and the <a shape="rect" href="../../../justice/courts_system/high_court.html">High Court</a> and other
public persons. </p>

<h3>Removal of a President from office</h3>

<p>There are 2 situations when a President may be removed from office. If 5
Supreme Court judges or more decide that a President has become permanently
incapacitated, the President's term of office will come to an end. </p>

<p>The President may also be impeached by either House of the Oireachtas for
"stated misbehaviour". Stated misbehaviour might include a criminal offence or
a misuse of the President's powers.</p>

<h3>Impeachment</h3>

<p>To propose a motion to impeach the President, at least 30 members of one
House of the Oireachtas must sign the proposal. Then at least two-thirds of all
of the members of that House must vote in favour of the proposal. </p>

<p>The other House of the Oireachtas must then investigate the charge that the
President is guilty of stated misbehaviour. The investigation may be carried
out by a committee or tribunal. The President has a right to appear and be
represented at the investigation of the charge.</p>

<p>At the end of the investigation, two-thirds of the members of the
investigating House must pass a resolution declaring that the President is
guilty of stated misbehaviour. The President's term of office will then come to
an end.</p>

<p>This means that in order to remove the President, two-thirds of the total
membership of both Houses of the Oireachtas must vote in favour of that course
of action.</p>

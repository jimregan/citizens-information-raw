<h2>Information</h2>

<p>Following a <a shape="rect" href="../elections_and_referenda/national_elections/the_general_election.html">general
election</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/dail_eireann.html">Dáil
Éireann</a> is summoned by the Irish President on the advice of the <a shape="rect" href="../national_government/the_irish_government/the_taoiseach.html">Taoiseach</a>
(the Prime Minister). The President must follow the advice of the Taoiseach.
</p>

<p>The President also has the power to dissolve or end the Dáil on the advice
of the Taoiseach. If the Taoiseach has the support of the majority of Dáil
Eireann, the President cannot refuse to dissolve it.</p>

<p>If the Taoiseach no longer has the support of the majority of Dáil Éireann
and they advise the President to dissolve the Dáil, the President may refuse.
</p>

<p>If the President refuses to dissolve the Dáil, the <a shape="rect" href="../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/work_of_a_td.html">members
of the Dáil</a> must then nominate an alternative <a shape="rect" href="../national_government/the_irish_government/the_government_introduction.html">Government</a>.
Since the foundation of the State, this power of refusal <span>has never been
exercised</span>. </p>

<h2>Information</h2>

<p>Legislation starts life as a <a shape="rect" href="../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/legislation.html">Bill</a>
which is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas (the Irish parliament).</p>

<p>Every Bill must be signed by the Irish President before it can become law.
As soon as the Bill has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, it is
presented to the President for signature.</p>

<p>A Bill must be signed on the 5th, 6th or 7th day after it has been presented
to the President. However, if the <a shape="rect" href="../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/the_seanad.html">Seanad</a>
agrees, the Government may request that the Bill be signed sooner.</p>

<p>When a Bill has been presented to the President, they have the power to
refer it to the Supreme Court within 7 days. This power is exercised by the
President when there is doubt as to whether the Bill is <a shape="rect" href="../irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">constitutional</a>.
They must first consult with the <a shape="rect" href="council_of_state.html">Council of State</a> but the decision to refer the
Bill is the President's alone.</p>

<p>If a Bill is referred to the Supreme Court, it must decide whether or not
the Bill conflicts with the Constitution. If the Supreme Court holds that the
Bill is unconstitutional, the President cannot sign it.</p>

<p>Once a Bill has been signed, the President must then publish a notice in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irisoifigiuil.ie/">Iris Oifiguil (the official
State gazette)</a> stating that the Bill has become law.</p>

<p>If the Government wishes to change or amend the Constitution, a Bill must be
passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas to amend the Constitution. The Irish
people must then approve the Bill in a <a shape="rect" href="../elections_and_referenda/referenda/constitutional_referendum_in_ireland.html">constitutional
referendum</a>. </p>

<p>Once the Bill has been approved by the people in a referendum, the President
must then sign the Bill so that the Constitution can be amended. </p>

<p>The President has 2 additional powers in relation to legislation that have
never been exercised. </p>

<p>They may refuse to sign a Bill if a majority of the members of the Seanad
and at least one-third of the members of the Dáil petition them not to sign
the Bill. The President must consult with the <a shape="rect" href="council_of_state.html">Council of State</a> before deciding within 6 days
whether or not to sign the Bill. </p>

<p>The President also has a power in relation to possible <a shape="rect" href="../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/legislation.html">Money
Bills</a>. The Seanad has less power in relation to Money Bills. If a conflict
arises between the Dáil and the Seanad as to whether or not a particular Bill
is a Money Bill, the Seanad may ask the President to refer the question to a
Committee of Privileges. The President must consult with the Council of State
before they decide whether or not to refer it. </p>

<p>The civil service are the public officials who advise and assist Government
Ministers in the running of their Departments. The <a shape="rect" href="../irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Constitution</a>
does not mention the civil service but it is vital to the functioning of the
state. </p>

<p>The civil service has three main functions: </p>
<ul><li>It advises the Government on policy </li>
  <li>It helps prepare and draft new legislation and </li>
  <li>It helps the Government to run the country according to the legislation
    passed by the Oireachtas. </li>
</ul><p>Each <a shape="rect" href="departments_of_state.html">Department of
State</a> has a permanent staff consisting of administrative, professional,
specialist and technical employees. The head civil servant of each Department
is the Secretary General, who is recommended by the Minister for that
Department and appointed for a period of 7 years by the Government. Below the
Secretary General, there are a number of Assistant Secretaries, who are each
responsible for specific areas of work in the Department. Below the Assistant
Secretaries, there are many officials at varying levels of seniority. </p>

<h3>Recruitment to the civil and public service</h3>

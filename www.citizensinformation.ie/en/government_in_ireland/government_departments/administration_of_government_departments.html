<h2>Information</h2>

<p>Each minister of the Government is responsible for running and managing the
department they have been allocated. There are 16 <a shape="rect" href="departments_of_state.html">government departments</a>. As well as the
Cabinet minister assigned to the department, <a shape="rect" href="../national_government/the_irish_government/composition_of_the_government.html">Ministers
of State</a> may also be appointed. You can find out about government spending
in each of these departments on <a href="http://www.whereyourmoneygoes.gov.ie/en/">whereyourmoneygoes.gov.ie</a>
<a href="http://www.whereyourmoneygoes.gov.ie/en/"></a></p>

<p>Each department employs a large number of <a shape="rect" href="the_civil_service.html">civil servants</a>, including a Secretary
General, who remain in their positions regardless of changes in the Government.
These officials advise and assist the minister in the running of the
department. </p>

<p>The minister may suggest and propose new or amended <a shape="rect" href="../national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/legislation.html">legislation</a>
to the Government relating to matters that arise in their department. </p>

<p>Ministers also have a power to make <em>Statutory Instruments</em> which are
also known as delegated or secondary legislation. Statutory Instruments allow
the minister to give effect to or implement legislation without the need to
have every detail passed by the Oireachtas. Statutory Instruments do not have
to be approved by the Oireachtas, although they may be cancelled by either
House. You can view all <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/">Irish Government legislation</a> from
1922 onwards.</p>

<h3>Code of practice on accessibility of public services and information
provided by public bodies</h3>

<p>The Disability Act 2005 provides a statutory basis for accessible public
services. Sections 26, 27 and 28 of the Act place obligations on public bodies
to make their services and information accessible to people with disabilities.
</p>

<p>The Department of Justice and Equality charged the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nda.ie">National Disability Authority (NDA)</a> with
developing a <a shape="rect" href="http://nda.ie/Good-practice/Codes-of-Practice/Code-of-Practice-on-Accessibility-of-Public-Services-and-Information-Provided-by-Public-Bodies-/">Code
of practice on accessibility of public services and information provided by
public bodies</a> as set out under Section 30 of the Act. The purpose of this
Code is to guide public bodies to meet their obligations under the Act. The
Code covers a wide range of services provided by public bodies - including the
provision of information, information resources, schemes, allowances or other
benefits administered by public bodies. </p>

<p>Article 28A of the <a shape="rect" href="../irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Irish
Constitution</a> (Bunreacht na hEireann) recognises the role of local
government in providing democratic representation of local communities. This
recognition endorses the democratic representative role of local government and
guarantees <a shape="rect" href="../elections_and_referenda/local_elections/local_elections.html">local
elections</a> at least every five years.</p>

<p>Local government not only represents the people in the local communities,
but also perform a number of important <a shape="rect" href="functions_of_local_authorities.html">functions</a>. Local government has
therefore both a representational and an operational role, with responsibility
for a range of services. It operates through a network of directly elected
local authorities which provide, among other things, a forum for the democratic
representation of local communities, giving expression to local identity,
identifying local concerns and setting local priorities. </p>

<p>To carry out their functions, local authorities are entrusted with certain
<a shape="rect" href="powers_of_local_authorities.html">powers</a>. </p>

<p>The primary legislation applying to local authorities is the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0037/index.html">Local
Government Act 2001</a>. </p>

<h3>Local government reform</h3>

<p>In October 2012 the Government published <a href="http://www.environ.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/putting_people_first.pdf">Putting
People First- Action Programme for Effective Local Government (pdf)</a> which
sets out Government policy for reforms across all the main areas of local
government. The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0001/index.html">Local
Government Reform Act 2014</a> amended the 2001 Act. With effect from June
2014, the town and borough councils were replaced by a comprehensive system of
municipal districts and a number of local authorities were merged. Further
information on local government reform is available on the <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentReform/">Department
of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government website</a>.</p>

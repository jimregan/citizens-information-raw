<p>There are a number of ways in which local authorities carry out their
functions. Some functions are carried out by the members of the authority
acting as a body at <a shape="rect" href="local_authority_meetings.html">meetings</a>. Some functions are carried
out by committees and some functions are carried out through the <a shape="rect" href="county_or_city_manager.html">council's chief
executive</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>At council meetings, the council may pass resolutions, for example to
introduce or change charges and rates.</p>

<p>The council can also pass Bye-Laws when it is in the interests of the common
good of the community that an activity should be regulated or controlled. It
also has the power to make Bye-Laws to prevent or stop any nuisance in the
area. </p>

<p>Local authorities frequently make Bye-Laws in relation to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/traffic_and_parking/parking_fines_and_vehicle_clamping.html">control
of parking</a>, litter and animal control (specifically <a shape="rect" href="/en/environment/animal_welfare_and_control/control_of_dogs.html">dog
control</a> and <a shape="rect" href="/en/environment/animal_welfare_and_control/control_of_horses.html">control
of horses</a>. </p>

<p>Two months before making a Bye-Law, the local authority must publish a
notice in a newspaper circulating in the area to which the Bye-Law relates,
indicating that it proposes to make the Bye-Law. The public is entitled to
inspect the proposed Bye-Law and make submissions about it before it comes into
effect.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>If you wish to inspect a Bye-Law, you may do so during office hours at your
local authority office. There is no charge for inspection of the Bye-Law.</p>

<p>If you wish to obtain a copy of the Bye-Law, you may have to pay for the
cost of copying it.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>To inspect a Bye-Law, simply go to <a shape="rect" href="local_authorities.html">your local authority office</a> and request the
Bye-Law in question. You may also request a copy - you may be charged a
reasonable fee for copying it.</p>

<p>If you wish to make submissions on the Bye-Law, you may do so in writing.
You must deliver your submissions to the local authority within the time limit.
The time limit is specified by the local authority but it cannot be less than 7
days after the end of the period for inspection.</p>

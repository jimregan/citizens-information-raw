<p>In a number of areas of local government activity, more indepth discussion
and consideration of matters can take place at committee level, rather than at
meetings of the full council. Following on from the Government's 1996
discussion paper 'Better Local Government', a new and more structured committee
system was introduced for local authorities. This new system replaced some of
the ad-hoc committees which had evolved over the years. </p>

<h3>Creating a local authority committee</h3>

<p>To create a committee, the council passes a resolution at a council meeting.
The committee must consist of at least 3 members of the council. You cannot be
a member of a local authority committee if you are not a member of the council
unless you have knowledge, qualifications or experience relating to the
functions of the committee.</p>

<p>The council can, by resolution, delegate some its functions to a committee
if at least Â½ of the members of the council vote in favour of the resolution.
However, it cannot delegate the adoption of the annual local authority budget.
The council also cannot delegate the power to create the <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/planning_permission/planning_devel_plans.html">Development
Plan</a>, decide on rates or borrow money. </p>

<p>The council must establish strategic policy committees (SPCs) to formulate,
develop, monitor and review policy relating to the authority's functions. The
SPCs must advise the local authority on policy. </p>

<p>Two or more local authorities can establish j<em>oint committees</em> to
perform the functions of the local authorities.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Each member of the local authority must serve on at least one SPC. Special
guidelines regarding these committees have been issued by the Minister for
Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and are set down in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0037/sec0048.html#partvii">Part
7, Sections 48-54 of the Local Government Act 2001</a>. This legislation sets
out the arrangements which apply to the establishment of these committees. </p>

<p>About two-thirds of the membership of these committees is made up of elected
members.The remaining third consists of representatives of sectoral interests.
For example, representatives of community, environmental, business, trade
union, farming interests. </p>

<p>The chairperson of each committee must be an elected member of the council.
Chairs of each committee are appointed by the council for a minimum period of
three years. </p>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0001/sec0036.html#sec36">Section
36 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014</a>, each local authority must
establish a Local Community Development Committee (LCDC) and may establish more
than one such committee if the Minister approves. The aim of the LCDCs is to
develop, co-ordinate and implement a coherent and integrated approach to local
and community development.</p>

<p>The membership of LCDCs includes members of the local authority, local
authority staff, representatives of public bodies which provide services in the
area; representatives of local community interests; local community
representatives; and representatives of publicly funded or supported local
development bodies. The majority of members must be from the non-statutory
sector.</p>

<p>The main function of an LCDC is to prepare, implement and monitor the
community elements of the six-year local economic and community plan. It must
consider the economic elements of the plan in order to enhance co-ordination
with the community elements and ultimately integrate the two elements but it
does not have a role in deciding on the economic elements. It has a general
role in seeking to ensure effectiveness, consistency, co-ordination and
avoidance of duplication between the various elements of local authority
activities in the community.</p>

<p>The local economic and community plan must be consistent with the local
development plans made by the elected members and with the regional spatial and
economic strategies. The plan must be considered by the municipal district
members and approved by the council.</p>

<h3>County and City Development Boards</h3>

<p>County and City Development Boards (CDBs) were established in 2000 in each
local authority area to bring together the key agencies and bodies in the area
to engage in long-term planning. They were abolished in June 2014 under the
2014 Act. Where appropriate, local and community development activity
previously undertaken by the CDBs comes within the remit of new Local Community
Development Committees. </p>

<p>Local authorities are responsible for the provision of an extensive range of
public services in your area. In addition, local authorities promote the
interests of your local community, including the social, economic,
environmental, recreational, cultural, community or general development of your
area. </p>

<h3>Responsibilities of local authorities</h3>

<p>These are typically broken down into the following broad categories: </p>
<ul><li>Housing </li>
  <li>Planning </li>
  <li>Roads </li>
  <li>Development incentives and controls </li>
  <li>Environmental protection including rivers, lakes, air and noise </li>
  <li>Recreation facilities and amenities </li>
</ul><p>In addition to the functions outlined above, a fundamental role of
democratically elected local government is the representation of local
communities, voicing local concerns and responding to local needs. </p>

<h3>Local authorities and housing</h3>

<p>Local authorities provide and maintain housing in their area. They assess
the housing needs for the area and build, buy and lease dwellings. They also
provide <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/housing_grants_and_schemes/">loans for
the repair and improvement of dwellings</a> within the area. </p>

<h3>Local authorities and recreation facilities and amenities</h3>

<p>Local authorities provide amenities, facilities and services related to
artistic and cultural activities, sports and games, general recreational and
leisure activities, libraries, civic improvements such as monuments,
environmental and heritage protection and the public use of amenities.</p>

<h3>Local authorities and planning</h3>

<p>Your local authority is the planning authority. It decides whether to grant
or refuse <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/planning_permission/planning_permission_general.html">planning
permission</a> for building and development in your area. It also creates a <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/planning_permission/planning_devel_plans.html">Development
Plan</a> every 6 years, which sets out its planning policies. </p>

<h3>Local authorities and essential services </h3>

<p>Local authorities provide essential services such as roads and bridges, <a shape="rect" href="../security_and_emergency_services/fire_services.html">fire
services</a> and drainage. <a href="http://www.water.ie/">Irish Water</a> is
responsible for water and wastewater services.</p>

<p>Local authorities also <a shape="rect" href="/en/environment/planning_and_development_in_ireland/copy_of_derelict_sites_and_dangerous_structures.html">control
dangerous places and buildings</a>, abattoirs and knackeries and provide and
maintain <a shape="rect" href="/en/death/after_a_death/burials.html">graveyards
and burial grounds</a>. </p>

<h3>Local authorities and environmental protection</h3>

<p>The local authority has an important function in relation to pollution
control and animal control. It issues <a shape="rect" href="/en/environment/waste_management_and_recycling/landfill_sites.html">licenses
for waste disposal</a> and for <a shape="rect" href="/en/environment/environmental_protection/air_pollution.html">emissions into
the air</a> from plants. It collects or arranges for the <a shape="rect" href="/en/environment/waste_management_and_recycling/domestic_refuse.html">collection
of domestic and other waste</a> and it monitors the environment for signs of
pollution. It also issues <a shape="rect" href="/en/environment/animal_welfare_and_control/control_of_dogs.html">licenses
for keeping dogs</a> and <a shape="rect" href="/en/environment/animal_welfare_and_control/control_of_horses.html">licenses
for horses</a> within its area. </p>

<p>The local authority grants licenses to street traders to allow them to sell
goods on the street and to casual traders to allow them to sell goods at casual
trading areas designated by the city, county, town or borough council.</p>

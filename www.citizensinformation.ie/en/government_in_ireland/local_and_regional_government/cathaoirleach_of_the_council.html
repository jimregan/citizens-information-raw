<p>Every year, each local authority elects a chair called the Cathaoirleach for
a term of one year and a deputy chair called the Leas-Cathaoirleach from among
its members. The members elected for each municipal district elect a
Cathaoirleach and a Leas-Chathaoirleach for their grouping.</p>

<p>The Cathaoirleach chairs the meetings of the local authority or municipal
district. The Leas-Cathaoirleach chairs meetings when the Cathaoirleach is not
present.</p>

<h3>Alternative titles</h3>

<p>Alternative titles to Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach may be used in
some cases. Cork and Dublin City Councils are entitled to use the titles Lord
Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor. Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City
and County Council and Galway City Council can use the titles Mayor and Deputy
Mayor.</p>

<p>The following municipal districts can use the titles Mayor and Deputy
Mayor:</p>
<ul><li>The municipal districts which were formerly Limerick City Council and
    Waterford City Council</li>
  <li>The municipal districts which were formerly borough councils - Clonmel,
    Drogheda, Kilkenny, Sligo and Wexford</li>
  <li>Municipal districts which include a town with a population of at least
    20,000</li>
</ul><p>County councils are not entitled to use the titles of Mayor or Deputy
Mayor.</p>

<h3>Role and responsibilities of the Cathaoirleach</h3>

<p>The Cathaoirleach takes the chair (or presides) at meetings of the local
authority or municipal district. On an occasion where this is an equal division
of votes on an issue, they may exercise a second or casting vote (except in the
case of when a new Cathaoirleach is being elected).</p>

<p>The Cathaoirleach is responsible for the conduct of business and maintenance
of order at meetings and can call for (or requisition) a special meeting of the
council and obtain information from the chief executive on relevant matters.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Election of the Cathaoirleach</h3>

<p>Every local authority or municipal district must elect one of it's member to
hold office for a term of one year, until a successor is elected at the next
annual meeting. It is possible that someone may be re-elected for a successive
term. This election takes place at the annual meeting and is the first business
of the meeting to take place. There are special rules which apply to the
election of the Cathaoirleach and these rules are set out in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0037/sec0037.html#sec37">Section
37</a> of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0037/index.html">Local
Government Act, 2001</a>.</p>

<p>If a casual vacancy occurs in the office of the Cathaoirleach, (for example,
if he or she dies or resigns) the members of the local authority or municipal
district elect one of their number to take office for the remaining period.</p>

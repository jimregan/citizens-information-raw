<p>As part of the Governmentâ€™s reform of local government as set out in <a href="http://www.environ.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/putting_people_first.pdf">Putting
People First- Action Programme for Effective Local Government (pdf)</a>, the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0001/index.html">Local
Government Reform Act 2014</a> provided for the existing 8 regional authorities
and 2 regional assemblies to be replaced by 3 new regional assemblies. The new
assemblies were established with effect from 1 January 2015 by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/si/0573.html">Local Government Act
1991 (Regional Assemblies) (Establishment) Order 2014 (SI 573 of 2014)</a>.</p>

<p>The membership of a regional assembly consists of members of the local
authorities within the region:</p>
<ul><li>The <strong>Northern and Western Regional Assembly</strong> has 21
    members and covers the county councils of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Galway,
    Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon and Sligo and the city council of Galway.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Southern Regional Assembly</strong> has 27 members and covers
    the county councils of Carlow, Clare, Cork, Kerry, Kilkenny, Tipperary and
    Wexford, the city council of Cork, and the city and county councils of
    Limerick and Waterford.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly</strong> has 35 members
    and covers the county councils of Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal, Kildare,
    Laois, Longford, Louth, Meath, Offaly, South Dublin, Westmeath and Wicklow
    and the city council of Dublin.</li>
</ul><p>The aim of the new assemblies is to co-ordinate, promote or support
strategic planning and sustainable development and promote effectiveness in
local government and public services. Their main function will be to draw up
regional spatial and economic strategies. These will replace the current
regional planning guidelines and will be drawn up in conjunction with the
various enterprise and economic development agencies. The existing regional
planning guidelines will remain in place until these new strategies are drawn
up. The 2014 Act sets out the details of how the strategies are to be
developed.</p>

<p>Since the 2014 local elections there are 31 local authorities with a total
of 949 members known as councillors. Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0001/index.html">Local
Government Reform Act 2014</a> the town authorities were replaced by a system
of 95 municipal districts, integrating town and county governance, and certain
local authorities were merged.</p>

<p>There are 26 county councils and they are responsible for local government
in 24 geographical counties including the county of Dublin. Dublin county has 3
county councils – <a href="http://www.sdcc.ie/services">South Dublin County
Council</a>, <a href="http://www.dlrcoco.ie/">Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County
Council</a> and <a href="http://www.fingalcoco.ie/">Fingal County
Council</a>.</p>

<p>There are 2 city and county councils. They are responsible for local
government in Limerick (<a href="http://www.limerick.ie/council">Limerick City
and County Council</a>) and Waterford (<a href="http://www.waterfordcouncil.ie/en/">Waterford City and County
Council</a>).</p>

<p>There are 3 city councils and they are responsible for local government in
the cities of Dublin, Cork and Galway.</p>

<p>The number of members that can be elected to a council depends on the size
of the county's population. For example, Cork County Council has 55 members and
Carlow County Council has only 18. The number of members in each council is set
out in <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0001/sec0015.html#sec15">Section
15 of the 2014 Act</a>.</p>

<p>The council has jurisdiction or control throughout its administrative
area.</p>

<p>Each council has a <a href="county_or_city_manager.html">chief
executive</a>, previously known as city or county manager, who is the manager
of the local authority.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.lgcsb.ie/en/irish-local-government">find your
local authority’s details</a> on the Local Government Management Agency
(LGMA) website.</p>

<h3>Municipal districts</h3>

<p>Under the 2014 Act each council administrative area, apart from the 3 Dublin
county councils and the 3 city councils, has a system of municipal districts
based on electoral areas. Each council has at least two municipal districts.
For example, Kilkenny County Council has <a href="http://www.kilkennycoco.ie/eng/Your_Council/Municipal-Districts/">3
municipal districts</a>.</p>

<p>The local authority members elected from these municipal districts take
certain decisions in relation to the districts. Certain municipal districts may
be known as metropolitan districts or borough districts.</p>

<p>The councils in Dublin and the city councils may establish area committees,
but they do not have the same functions as municipal districts.</p>

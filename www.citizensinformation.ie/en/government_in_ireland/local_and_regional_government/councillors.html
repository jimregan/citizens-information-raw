<p>The members of each local authority are all called
'<span>councillors</span>'. (For example, county councillor, city councillor as
appropriate). The number of members of each local authority is fixed by law.
This means that Schedule 7 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0037/index.html">Local
Government Act, 2001</a>, as amended by <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0001/sec0015.html#sec15">Section
15 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014</a>, has set down the number of
members of every county council, city council and city and county council
throughout the country.</p>

<p>Councillors are directly elected in <a shape="rect" href="../elections_and_referenda/local_elections/local_elections.html">local
elections</a> by members of the local community. The number of councillors
elected to each local authority depends on the population of the local
authority area. </p>

<h3>Term of office</h3>

<p>Elected members come into office seven days after polling day. Each member
holds office for five years, that is until seven days after the polling day at
the next local elections â€“ which are by law held in the month of May or June
on a day fixed by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local
Government. Each elected member is expected to regularly attend meetings of the
full council and the <a shape="rect" href="local_authority_committees.html">local authority committees</a> of which
they are members, although it may occasionally be the case that members may not
be able to fulfil their obligations, for example, due to ill-health.</p>

<p>A councillor may resign by delivering a notice in writing. They are deemed
to have resigned if he or she <span>does not attend</span> a council meeting
for <span>6 consecutive months</span> (unless he or she was ill or there was
some other good reason).</p>

<p>However, before the expiry of this period a local authority may by
resolution grant <span>an extension</span> for a <span>further six
months</span> where the absence is due to illness or occurs in good faith due
to other reasons. Only <span>one further subsequent</span> such extension may
be granted, subject to a maximum period of <span>eighteen months</span>
continuous absence.</p>

<p>If a councillor dies, resigns or becomes disqualified from being a member of
the council, the vacancy is filled by <em>co-option</em>. The political party
who originally nominated the member who caused the vacancy nominates a new
member and the council then passes a resolution to appoint the new member.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Councillors may not be members of more than one local authority.</p>

<h3>Ethics and codes of conduct</h3>

<p>In January 2003 an ethics framework came into operation governing the ethics
and codes of conduct of local authority members. As a general rule, this
framework provides that it is the duty of every local authority member and
employee to maintain proper standards of integrity, conduct and concern for the
public interest. In addition, it established for each member a system of annual
declaration of interests, disclosure of interest in a matter which comes before
the authority and a public register of interests.</p>

<p>The interests which have to be declared annually are set out in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0037/sec0175.html#partxv-sec175">Section
175</a> of the 2001 Act and associated regulations. (As a general guide, they
include such as holdings of land or other property, shareholdings,
directorships, contracts with a local authority. Each member must complete and
return each year a form setting out his or her interests).</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>There is a financial support framework for councillors which involves:</p>
<ul><li>Representational payment (i.e., a salary-type payment) </li>
  <li>Fixed annual allowance (towards meetings and other expenses) </li>
  <li>Ad-hoc expenses (i.e., conferences and other events) </li>
  <li>Retirement gratuity (i.e., lump sum on retirement) </li>
</ul><p>The <a shape="rect" href="cathaoirleach_of_the_council.html">cathaoirleach
of the council</a> and the chairperson of one of the local authority committees
(the special policy committee) also get an additional allowance. </p>

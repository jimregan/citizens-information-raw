<p>The euro area (also known as the eurozone) consists of those European Union
(EU) countries which have adopted the euro as their currency. It currently has
<a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/joining-the-euro-area/">19
member states</a> including Ireland. All EU member states have committed to
joining the euro, except for Denmark and the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/index_en.htm">more information
on the adoption of the euro</a> on the European Commission's website.</p>

<h3>Eurogroup</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/eurogroup/">Eurogroup</a> is
the main forum for the management of the single currency area. It is an
informal body that brings together the finance ministers of the member states
whose currency is the euro. The Vice-President responsible for Economic and
Monetary Affairs in the <a href="../eu_institutions/european_commission.html">EU Commission</a> and the
President of the European Central Bank also participate in Eurogroup
meetings.</p>

<p>The Eurogroupâ€™s role is to ensure close coordination of economic policies
within the euro area. It usually meets once a month, on the eve of the meeting
of the <a href="../eu_institutions/council_of_the_european_union.html">Council of the
European Union</a> (Economic and Financial Affairs - ECOFIN).</p>

<h3>Euro Summits</h3>

<p>Euro Summits brings together the heads of state or government of EU member
states whose currency is the euro, the President of the Euro Summit and the
President of the European Commission. Euro area leaders elect the President of
the Euro Summit by simple majority, at the same time as the European Council
elects its President. The mandate for both roles is two and a half years.</p>

<p>The <a href="fiscal_stability_treaty.html">Fiscal Stability Treaty</a>
requires a minimum of 2 Euro Summit meetings a year. The <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/european-council/euro-summit/">Euro
Summit</a> meetings provide strategic direction on the economic and fiscal
policies in the euro area. Discussions on the specific responsibilities linked
to euro area membership assist the member states in taking into account the
euro area dimension in their national policy-making.</p>

<h3>European Central Bank</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html">European
Central Bank (ECB)</a> is the central bank for the euro and is responsible for
conducting monetary policy for the euro area. Its main task is to maintain the
euro's purchasing power, thus ensuring price stability in the euro area.</p>

<p>The ECB is part of the European System of Central Banks, which also includes
the national central banks of all EU member states, whether they have adopted
the euro or not. The Eurosystem, on the other hand, comprises the ECB and only
the national central banks of those countries that have adopted the euro. The
Eurosystem and the European System of Central Banks will co-exist as long as
there are EU member states outside the euro area.</p>

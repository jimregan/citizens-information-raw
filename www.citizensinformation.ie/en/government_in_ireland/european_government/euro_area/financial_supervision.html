<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>The 2008 financial crisis exposed important failures in EU financial
supervision. In 2011 a new European system was set up for the supervision of
the financial sector. The European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS) is
made up of 3 European supervisory authorities (ESA):</p>
<ul><li>The European Banking Authority</li>
  <li>The European Securities and Markets Authority</li>
  <li>The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority</li>
</ul><p>In cooperation and coordination with national supervisory authorities, the
ESAs are in place to ensure that rules are applied in a rigorous and consistent
fashion throughout the EU, to monitor developments within the financial system
and to detect potential risks to financial stability.</p>

<p>The ESFS also comprises the European Systemic Risk Board as well as the
Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities and the national
supervisory authorities.</p>

<h3>European Banking Authority</h3>

<p>The role of the <a href="http://www.eba.europa.eu/">European Banking
Authority (EBA)</a> is to ensure effective and consistent <a href="http://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy">prudential regulation</a>
and supervision across the European banking sector. Its overall objective is to
safeguard the integrity, efficiency and orderly functioning of the banking
sector.</p>

<p>The EBA contributes to the <a href="http://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/single-rulebook">Single
Rulebook</a> in banking whose objective is to provide a single set of
harmonised prudential rules for financial institutions throughout the EU. The
Authority also plays a role in promoting <a href="http://www.eba.europa.eu/supervisory-convergence">convergence of
supervisory practices</a> and assesses risks and vulnerabilities in the EU
banking sector.</p>

<h3>European Securities and Markets Authority</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.esma.europa.eu/">European Securities and Markets
Authority (ESMA)</a> is responsible for the integrity, transparency, efficiency
and orderly functioning of securities markets, as well as for improving
investor protection. It contributes to the Single Rrulebook for EU financial
markets and encourages supervisory convergence amongst securities regulators
and across financial sectors by working closely with the other European
supervisory authorities.</p>

<h3>European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://eiopa.europa.eu/">European Insurance and Occupational
Pensions Authority (EIOPA)</a> is responsible for supporting the transparency
of markets and financial products and for fostering the protection of
policyholders, pension scheme members and beneficiaries in the area of
insurance and occupational pensions. It monitors and identifies trends,
potential risks and vulnerabilities across borders and across sectors. It also
contributes to the Single Rulebook for insurance and pensions, and towards the
convergence of supervisory procedures and approaches throughout the EU.</p>

<h3>European Systemic Risk Board</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.esrb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html">European
Systemic Risk Board (ESRB)</a> is responsible for the macro-prudential
oversight of the financial system in the EU. One of its main objectives is to
prevent and mitigate systemic risks. If it identifies such risks it can issue
warnings and recommend measures to be taken.</p>

<h3>Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities</h3>

<p>The Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities is a forum for
cooperation between the 3 European supervisory authorities. Through the Joint
Committee, they cooperate regularly and closely and ensure consistency in their
practices.</p>

<p>In addition to being a forum for cooperation, the Joint Committee also plays
an important role in the exchange of information with the European Systemic
Risk Board (ESRB) and in developing the relationship between the ESRB and the
European supervisory authorities.</p>

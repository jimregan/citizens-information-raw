<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The European Union (EU) rules on government debt and deficits are set out in
the treaties which govern the EU and in a series of EU laws. The two major
rules are contained in Article 126 and Protocol No 12 of the <a href="http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/08/st06/st06655-re07.en08.pdf">Treaty
on the Functioning of the European Union (pdf)</a>. The detailed rules on
implementing these major rules are generally contained in EU Directives and
Regulations. The collection of rules is called the <em>Stability and Growth
Pact</em>. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l3f28a">Stability and Growth Pact</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/sgp/index_en.htm">Stability
and Growth Pact (SGP)</a> came into force in 1998. It has been amended a number
of times since then and particularly in December 2011 when the so-called <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-11-898_en.htm">Six-pack</a>
came into effect.</p>

<p>The SGP originally focused on monitoring member states' compliance with the
agreed targets for their budget deficits. Now, a similar process is also in
place for their public debt levels. In addition, the focus has shifted from
correction to prevention - member states must focus more on long-term
sustainability and must correct unsustainable policies as soon as they are
identified, before acute problems arise. Although it applies to all EU
countries, the SGP has stricter enforcement mechanisms for euro area
members.</p>

<p>In May 2013, a new package of legislation (<a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-457_en.htm">the
Two-pack</a>) for euro area member states only, came into force with 2 key
objectives:</p>
<ul><li>To improve budgetary coordination by introducing a common budgetary
    timeline for the euro area member states and allowing the European
    Commission to assess national budgetary plans prior to their adoption</li>
  <li>To improve economic and financial surveillance in the euro area through a
    system whereby a member state experiencing serious financial difficulties
    or financial sector instability would be subject to enhanced surveillance
    by the European Commission</li>
</ul><p>As part of the common budgetary timeline, euro area member states are
required to present their draft budgets at the same time each year (15 October)
and the Commission has the right to assess them. The Commission could issue an
opinion on them or could request that they be revised if they were inconsistent
with the SGP. Euro area member states are required to have independent fiscal
councils and to base their budgets on independent forecasts.</p>

<h3>Prevention and correction</h3>

<p>The SGP is sometimes described as having a <em>preventative arm</em> and a
<em>corrective arm</em>. The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/sgp/preventive_arm/index_en.htm">preventative
arm</a> involves mutual surveillance on member states. The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/sgp/corrective_arm/index_en.htm">corrective
arm</a> involves intervention to correct breaches of the rules.</p>

<p>The 2 major rules on the level of government debt and deficits are:</p>
<ul><li>Total government debt must not be more than 60% of gross domestic product
    (GDP)</li>
  <li>The government deficit must not be more than 3% of GDP except in
    particular circumstances</li>
</ul><p>If a member state is in breach of this requirement, an <em>excessive deficit
procedure</em> comes into operation. This means, among other things, that the
member state in question is subject to overall EU surveillance and must comply
with the EU decisions of how to deal with the problem. Member states must make
significant progress towards reaching their medium-term budgetary objectives
within the transition period set for them.</p>

<p>If a member state deviates significantly from the plan to reach the
medium-term budgetary objective a warning is addressed to it by the <a href="../eu_institutions/european_commission.html">Commission</a> and the <a href="../eu_institutions/council_of_the_european_union.html">Council</a>.
Since December 2011, financial sanctions may apply to euro area member states
that do not take adequate action to deal with their problems. A decision to
apply a financial sanction can be made by what is called the <em>reverse
qualified majority</em> voting procedure (see below).</p>

<p>The excessive deficit procedure may be used in cases of breaches of the debt
requirement as well as breaches of the deficit requirement. Again, member
states are given a transition period to work towards the requirement – in
general, the debt must be reduced by one twentieth each year. Countries which
are already in the excessive deficit procedure because of not meeting the 3%
criterion are expected to work towards reducing their debt as well. They have a
further 3 years to meet the 60% criterion after they have achieved the 3%
criterion.</p>

<p>At present a number of EU member states, including Ireland, are in the
excessive deficit procedure. Ireland has until 2015 to meet the deficit
requirement of 3% of GDP and has until 2018 to meet the debt requirement.</p>

<h3>Reverse qualified majority voting</h3>

<p>In general, EU decisions are made in the following manner:</p>
<ul><li>The Commission makes a proposal</li>
  <li>The European Parliament and the Council then decide on that proposal by
    means of a <a href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/institutions-bodies/council-eu/index_en.htm">qualified
    majority</a></li>
</ul><p>Any decision to impose a financial sanction is taken differently:</p>
<ul><li>The Commission makes a recommendation to the Council</li>
  <li>The Council imposes the financial sanction unless a qualified majority of
    its members vote against it</li>
</ul><p>This is known as reverse qualified majority voting.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l6e5ce">Macroeconomic imbalances procedure</h2>

<p>A <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/macroeconomic_imbalance_procedure/index_en.htm">macroeconomic
imbalances procedure<em>(MIP)</em></a> is a surveillance mechanism that was
introduced in December 2011 to deal with economic problems other than debt and
deficits (for example, major changes in international investment, exports,
labour costs, private sector debt or housing costs). This involves the
Commission and the Council intervening at an early stage to prevent
macroeconomic imbalances occurring and then setting requirements for correcting
those imbalances. Failure to correct them may result in financial sanctions in
the same way as failure to address the deficit and debt requirements (see
‘Prevention and correction’ above). Decisions on these will also be taken
by reverse qualified majority.</p>

<p>The first Alert Mechanism Report on macroeconomic imbalances was issued in
February 2012. This is the start of the surveillance procedure. It aims to
identify countries which may need further analysis. It involves the examination
of a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/macroeconomic_imbalance_procedure/mip_scoreboard/index_en.htm">number
of economic indicators</a> to identify possible imbalances. Countries such as
Ireland that are implementing a programme of reforms negotiated with the
Commission and supported by external financial assistance are not assessed as
they are already subject to enhanced economic surveillance.</p>

<p>If the Commission considers that there could be a macroeconomic imbalance,
it makes a recommendation to the member state concerned to correct the
imbalance or prevent an imbalance from occurring. If the degree of the
macroeconomic imbalance is considered severe or may jeopardise the proper
functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union, the Commission can recommend to
the Council to place the member state under an <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/macroeconomic_imbalance_procedure/mip_framework/index_en.htm">excessive
imbalance procedure</a>.</p>

<p>In the February 2012 review, the Commission considered that 12 countries
warranted an in-depth review. In May 2012 in-depth reviews for the 12 member
states were published. Appropriate policy responses to the identified
imbalances were integrated in the set of country-specific recommendations
issued by the Council in July 2012 under the European Semester.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l06990">The European Semester</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/the_european_semester/index_en.htm">European
Semester</a> is the economic policy cycle that covers economic, budgetary and
structural changes as well as measures to improve growth.</p>

<p>Governments in the euro area countries present stability programmes (dealing
with fiscal policies) in April. (Governments in the non-euro countries present
convergence programmes.) These programmes include an outline of the planned
next budget. So the stability programmes presented by the member states in
April 2013 have an outline of the 2014 budget.</p>

<p>Governments also present National Reform Programmes which deal with
structural changes in April.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l68eec">Broad Economic Policy Guidelines</h2>

<p>The Broad Economic Policy Guidelines (BEPG) deal with macroeconomic and
structural policies for both the EU as a whole and for the individual member
states. They are agreed by the Council of Finance Ministers (generally known as
Ecofin). They are not legally binding on the member states but Ecofin may issue
recommendations for corrective action. The <a href="introduction_to_the_euro_area.html">Eurogroup</a> is the finance
ministers from the member states which use the euro. It monitors the euro
member states’ adherence to the BEPGs.</p>

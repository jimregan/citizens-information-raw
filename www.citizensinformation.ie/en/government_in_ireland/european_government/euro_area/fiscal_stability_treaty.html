<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and
Monetary Union (TSCG) was signed in March 2012 by the leaders of all euro area
members and 8 other EU member states. It entered into force on 1 January 2013
and aims to strengthen fiscal discipline in the euro area through a balanced
budget rule and an automatic correction mechanism. The Treaty is frequently
described as the “Fiscal Compact Treaty” or the “Fiscal Stability
Treaty”.</p>

<p>The Treaty applies in full to the countries who have ratified it and whose
currency is the euro. There are different rules for the non-euro countries.</p>

<p>The Treaty is an inter-governmental treaty and not an EU treaty, but its
implementation involves using the EU institutions. It does not amend the
existing EU treaties. Although it is not itself part of the treaties which
govern the EU, it is applied and interpreted in conformity with the EU treaties
and with EU law.</p>

<p>It is the intention of the parties to the Treaty to incorporate its
substance into the EU treaties as soon as possible and within 5 years of it
coming into force at the latest.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l8864e">The Fiscal Stability Treaty</h2>

<p>The Treaty deals with 3 main issues:</p>
<ul><li>Fiscal stability, that is, the rules on the levels of government deficit
    and government debt (the fiscal rules in the Treaty are sometimes described
    as the “Fiscal Compact”)</li>
  <li>Economic co-ordination in the EU</li>
  <li>How the euro area is governed</li>
</ul><p>There are already detailed <a href="eu_economic_governance.html">EU
rules</a> in existence about these issues, particularly about fiscal stability.
The Treaty repeats some of these rules, reinforces some and introduces some new
rules.</p>

<h3>Fiscal stability</h3>

<p>The Treaty requires that the rules on government deficits and debts be put
into national law by the end of 2013 and that there be a national body with
responsibility for monitoring their implementation.</p>

<h3>Balanced budget/the deficit brake</h3>

<p>The Treaty requires that the general government budget must be balanced or
in surplus. This means that, in general, a government’s <em>structural
deficit</em> must not be more than 0.5% of gross domestic product (GDP). The
structural deficit is the general government deficit adjusted for the economic
cycle and for one-off or temporary measures. It must be estimated. However, it
is difficult to estimate it accurately and precision is not possible.</p>

<p>If the structural deficit is more than 0.5% of GDP, the government is
obliged to work towards reducing it. This must be done within time limits set
by the EU.</p>

<p>If the government debt is significantly below 60% of GDP and the public
finances are sustainable in the long term, the structural deficit may be up to
1% of GDP.</p>

<p>The structural deficit is the general government deficit adjusted for the
economic cycle and for one-off or temporary measures. It must be estimated. It
is difficult to estimate it accurately and precision is not possible.</p>

<p>The Treaty provides that the rules on the structural deficit are met if the
deficit is at its <em>country specific medium-term objective</em>. This means
that a separate objective is set for each country – the specific
circumstances of each country are taken into account when setting this
objective. The objective is revised from time to time to take account of
economic changes. Each country is obliged to work towards achieving the
objective which has been set for it within a timetable set by the EU. The
country may deviate from the timetable only in exceptional circumstances.
Exceptional circumstances are:</p>
<ul><li>Unusual events outside the control of the country concerned which have a
    major impact on the financial position of the general government</li>
  <li>Periods of severe economic downturn.</li>
</ul><p>If there are significant deviations from the medium-term objective or the
timetable set to achieve it, a <em>correction mechanism</em> is triggered. This
will oblige the country to correct the deviation over a defined period.</p>

<h3>Level of government debt/the debt brake</h3>

<p>Under the existing rules, all countries are required to maintain their
general government debt below 60% of GDP. The Treaty repeats that requirement.
Where the debt is greater than 60%, it must be reduced by one twentieth a year
on average until the target is met.</p>

<h3>Implementation and enforcement</h3>

<p>If the Commission concludes that a country has failed to comply with the
requirements to put the rules on government deficits and debts fully into law,
or another country reaches this conclusion, the issue may be referred to the <a href="../eu_institutions/european_court_of_justice.html">European Court of
Justice</a>. The Court’s ruling is binding on all parties. If the country
fails to abide by the ruling, the Court may impose financial sanctions on that
country. The sanction may be a lump sum or penalty payment of not more than
0.1% of the country’s GDP. In the case of euro area countries, any such
penalty will be payable to the <a href="eu_stabilisation_mechanisms.html">European Stability Mechanism
(ESM)</a>.</p>

<p>Countries which have excessive deficits (technically, the countries which
are in the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/sgp/corrective_arm/index_en.htm">excessive
deficit procedure</a>) are required to put in place a detailed programme of
structural reforms which are designed to reduce the deficit. The content and
format of these programmes are set out in EU law. They are monitored by the
European Commission and the Council in the same way as the current EU rules on
government debt and deficits, known as the <a href="eu_economic_governance.html">Stability and Growth Pact</a>, is
monitored at present. Among other things, countries are required to report
their plans for issuing public debt to the Commission and the Council.</p>

<p>The monitoring of the Stability and Growth Pact includes the European
Commission making recommendations for the correction of excessive deficits.
This Treaty provides that, in general, the countries that have ratified it must
support the Commission’s proposals. This obligation will not apply where a <a href="../eu_institutions/council_of_the_european_union.html">qualified
majority</a> of the euro area countries opposes the proposed recommendation or
decision.</p>

<h3>Economic co-ordination</h3>

<p>The treaties governing the EU already provide for various economic
co-ordination procedures and mechanisms including some which are specific to
euro area countries. The countries which have ratified the Treaty restate their
general commitment to take the measures necessary for the good functioning of
the euro area in pursuit of the objectives of fostering competitiveness,
promoting employment, contributing further to the sustainability of public
finances and reinforcing financial stability. The ratifying countries also
agree to discuss planned economic policy reforms among themselves before they
are implemented and, where appropriate, co-ordinate such reforms.</p>

<h3>Governance of the euro area</h3>

<p>The Treaty formalises the practice whereby the leaders of the euro area
countries hold informal meetings. It requires that the heads of state or
government of the euro area countries that ratify the Treaty must meet
informally in <a href="introduction_to_the_euro_area.html">Euro Summit
meetings</a>. The meetings must be held with the President of the European
Commission. The President of the European Central Bank must be invited to take
part and the President of the European Parliament may be invited.</p>

<p>The President of the Euro Summit is appointed by the heads of state or
government of the euro area countries, by a simple majority, at the same time
the European Council elects its President and for the same term of office. Euro
Summit meetings must take place at least twice a year.</p>

<h3>Other issues</h3>

<p>The Treaty provides for a conference of representatives of the European
Parliament and national parliaments in order to discuss budgetary policies and
other issues covered by the Treaty.</p>

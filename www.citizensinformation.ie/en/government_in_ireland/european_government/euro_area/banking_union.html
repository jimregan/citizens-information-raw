<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>In June 2012, the <a href="../eu_institutions/european_council.html">European Council</a> decided
to create a banking union that would allow for centralised supervision and
resolution for banks in the <a href="introduction_to_the_euro_area.html">euro area</a>. The intention was
to ensure that banks are stronger and better supervised and, should problems
arise in the financial sector, they can be resolved more easily and without
using taxpayers' money.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/finance/general-policy/docs/banking-union/banking-union-memo_en.pdf">banking
union (pdf)</a> is made up of a Single Supervisory Mechanism and a Single
Resolution Mechanism, both of which are mandatory for all euro area member
states and open to all other countries in the EU.</p>

<p>There is also a set of common rules for banks in all EU member states, known
as the <em>single rulebook</em>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l84375">Single Supervisory Mechanism</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/finance/general-policy/banking-union/single-supervisory-mechanism/index_en.htm">Single
Supervisory Mechanism (SSM)</a> became operational in November 2014. Under the
SSM, the <a href="http://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html">European
Central Bank (ECB)</a> is the banking supervisor for all banks in the euro area
and is directly responsible for supervising the approximately 123 largest
banking groups. The national supervisors, such as the <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/financial_institutions/central_bank_and_financial_services_authority_of_ireland.html">Central
Bank of Ireland</a>, continue to monitor the remaining banks.</p>

<p>The main tasks of the ECB and the national supervisors, working closely
together, are to check that banks comply with the EU banking rules and to
tackle problems early on.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l8c953">Single Resolution Mechanism</h2>

<p>While the role of the SSM is to make bank failures less likely, the role of
the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/finance/general-policy/banking-union/single-resolution-mechanism/index_en.htm">Single
Resolution Mechanism (SRM)</a> is to ensure an orderly resolution of failing
banks with minimal costs for taxpayers and to the real economy.</p>

<p>The SRM covers banks overseen by the SSM. It has been operational since the
beginning of 2015 and will be fully operational (with a complete set of
resolution powers) from January 2016.</p>

<p>The SRM is made up of a board, the Single Resolution Board and a fund, the
Single Resolution Fund.</p>

<h3>Single Resolution Board</h3>

<p>Once informed by the ECB that a bank is in trouble, the <a href="http://srb.europa.eu/">Single Resolution Board (SRB)</a> is responsible
for taking most decisions on the best course of action and preparing for the
resolution of the failing bank. The Board is also responsible for managing the
Single Resolution Fund.</p>

<h3>Single Resolution Fund</h3>

<p>The Single Resolution Fund (SRF) is financed by all the banks in the banking
union countries. For situations when the SRF is not sufficiently funded by the
banking sector, a <em>backstop</em> will be developed, which will facilitate
borrowing by the SRF. The euro area banking sector will ultimately be liable
for the SRF repayments by means of levies.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l1f48b">Single rulebook</h2>

<p>Both the supervisory and resolution mechanisms are underpinned by a set of
common rules known as the <a href="http://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/single-rulebook">single
rulebook</a>. The single rulebook is the foundation of the banking union. It
consists of a set of legislative texts that all financial institutions in the
EU must comply with. These rules, among other things, lay down <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/finance/bank/regcapital/index_en.htm">capital
requirements</a> for banks, ensure better <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/finance/bank/guarantee/index_en.htm">protection for
depositors</a>, and regulate the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/finance/bank/crisis_management/index_en.htm">prevention
and management of bank failures</a>.</p>

<p>There were 2 temporary mechanisms set up for providing funding to member
states which were experiencing economic difficulties – the European Financial
Stabilisation Mechanism and the European Financial Stability Facility. Both
were established in 2010 and both provided loans to Ireland under the IMF/EU
Memorandum of Understanding with Ireland. (Under this arrangement, Ireland also
received loans from the IMF and bilateral loans from some non-euro member
states – in particular, the UK).</p>

<p>A permanent mechanism – the European Stability Mechanism - was established
in October 2012. These 3 funding mechanisms are usually described as
“bail-out” mechanisms.</p>

<h3>European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism</h3>

<p>The European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) was created by the
European Council in 2010. It was established under <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32010R0407">Regulation
(EU) No 407/2010 of 11 May 2010</a>. The regulation gave the European
Commission the power to contract borrowings on behalf of the EU in order to
fund loans to the euro countries that need them. It was designed as a temporary
mechanism which might be available to provide loans to member states that were
having severe financial or economic problems.</p>

<p>Further information on the EFSM is available on the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu_borrower/efsm/">European
Commission’s website</a>.</p>

<h3>European Financial Stability Facility</h3>

<p>The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) is a company which was
established by the countries that share the euro. It was incorporated in
Luxembourg in June 2010. The shareholders are the member states who use the
euro. The EFSF’s aim was to provide temporary financial assistance to any
euro area member state that needed it.</p>

<p>Since 1 July 2013, the EFSF can no longer engage in new financing programmes
or enter into new loan facility agreements. It continues to finance programmes
that were started before the establishment of the European Stability
Mechanism.</p>

<p>Further information is available on the <a href="http://www.efsf.europa.eu/about/index.htm">EFSF website</a>.</p>

<h3>European Stability Mechanism</h3>

<p>The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is the permanent crisis mechanism to
safeguard financial stability in the euro area (the permanent bail-out
mechanism). It was established in October 2012 following ratification of the <a href="https://www.esm.europa.eu/legal-documents/esm-treaty">Treaty Establishing
the ESM</a> by all 17 euro area member states. The ESM treaty refers to the <a href="fiscal_stability_treaty.html">Fiscal Stability Treaty</a> and provides
that assistance from the ESM is dependent on the country concerned having
ratified the Fiscal Stability Treaty. Ireland ratified the ESM treaty by means
of legislation.</p>

<p>The ESM’s Board of Governors is made up of the finance ministers of euro
area member states and is chaired by the President of the <a href="introduction_to_the_euro_area.html">Eurogroup</a>. It has its
headquarters in Luxembourg.</p>

<p>The ESM provides help to euro area member states who are having financial
difficulties. The help is subject to various conditions in respect of economic
and fiscal management.</p>

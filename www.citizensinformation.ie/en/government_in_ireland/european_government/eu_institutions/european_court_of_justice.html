<p>The European Court of Justice (ECJ) is the judicial institution of the
European Union. This means that it deals with disputes between parties as the
<a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/courts.html">courts</a> do in
Ireland. The ECJ has the important function of ensuring that European law is
interpreted and applied in the same way in every member state. It sits in
Luxembourg and is composed of 28 judges, one judge from each member state. In
addition to the 28 judges at the ECJ, there are 8 Advocate Generals who deliver
reasoned opinions on cases to assist the ECJ in making its decisions. </p>

<p>Judges and Advocate Generals of the ECJ must have the qualifications to be
appointed to the highest national courts in their member states or they may be
jurisconsults (academic lawyers). Their independence must be beyond doubt. This
means that once they are appointed, they may not hold any other office of an
administrative or political nature and they may not engage in any occupation,
paid or unpaid. The Judges and Advocate Generals are appointed by joint
agreement of the governments of the member states. They have a renewable term
of 6 years. </p>

<p>The European Court of Justice sits and hears cases all year round. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7033/#avantpropos">Court of First
Instance</a> was set up in 1989. The Court of First Instance rules on certain
categories of cases at first instance, for example, cases relating to breach of
competition law, breach of commercial policy or social policy or disputes
concerning EU staff regulations. Decisions of the Court of First Instance may
be appealed to the ECJ. </p>

<p>The ECJ upholds the Treaties and ensures that European law is interpreted
and applied in the same way across the EU through various forms of legal
action. These include:</p>
<ul><li>Preliminary rulings. To avoid differences of interpretation of EU law by
    national courts, the preliminary ruling procedure allows co-operation
    between national courts and the ECJ. If a case comes before a national
    court that involves an interpretation of an EU law and there is a doubt as
    to how it should be interpreted, the national court will refer the question
    to the ECJ to decide. The ECJ will make a decision as to how the law should
    be interpreted or applied and will send that decision to the national
    court. The national court must then apply that decision to the case before
    it. </li>
  <li>Proceedings for failure to fulfill an obligation. The Commission or a
    member state may commence proceedings at the ECJ to force a member state to
    comply with EU law. If the ECJ decides that the member state in question is
    at fault, the member state must rectify the situation without delay. </li>
  <li>Proceedings for annulment. A member state, the Commission, the Council of
    the European Union or the European Parliament may request the annulment or
    cancellation of an EU law. This may happen if an EU institution enacts a
    law that conflicts with the EU Treaties. If the ECJ agrees that the
    disputed law is contrary to the Treaties, it will declare the law null and
    void. Private individuals may also bring proceedings for annulment of an EU
    law if they can demonstrate that the disputed law affects them directly and
    individually. To bring proceedings for annulment, you should obtain legal
    advice and/or representation. You do not need to go through the national
    courts first in order to bring proceedings for annulment in the ECJ. If you
    lose the case at the ECJ, you may be liable to pay the costs of both sides.
    If you succeed, your costs will be paid by the EU and the law will be
    declared null and void throughout the EU. </li>

<p>The office of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/home/en/default.htm">European
Ombudsman</a> was established in 1992 by the <a shape="rect" href="https://europa.eu/european-union/law/treaties_en">Maastricht Treaty</a>
to deal with complaints regarding maladministration by the institutions and
bodies of the <a shape="rect" href="../european_union.html">European Union</a>.
"<em>Maladministration</em>" means poor or failed administration and occurs if
an institution fails to do something it should have done, if it does it in the
wrong way or if it does something it should not have done. The role of the
European Ombudsman is to safeguard the fundamental rights of citizens living in
Europe by ensuring open and accountable administrations within the European
Union. </p>

<p>European citizens have the right to complain to the European Ombudsman if
they have concerns relating to maladministration by institutions and bodies of
the European Community. Instances of maladministration include:</p>
<ul><li>Administrative irregularities </li>
  <li>Unfairness </li>
  <li>Discrimination </li>
  <li>Abuse of power </li>
  <li>Lack of information </li>
  <li>Refusal of information and </li>
  <li>Unnecessary delay. </li>
</ul><p>For example, many complaints lodged with the European Ombudsman to date
concern administrative delay, late payment, arbitrary discrimination, lack of
transparency or refusal of access to information. Some complaints concern work
relations between European institutions and their agents, recruitment of staff
and the running of competitions. Others are related to contractual relations
between the institutions of the European Community and private firms.</p>

<p>While the European Ombudsman usually conducts inquiries on the basis of
complaints from European citizens, he or she can also launch investigations on
his or her own initiative. </p>

<p>The European Ombudsman delivers an Annual Report to the <a shape="rect" href="european_parliament.html">European Parliament</a>, which is translated
into all the official languages of the Union. The European Ombudsman also makes
official visits to all member states to enable him or her to present his or her
work directly to European citizens. </p>

<h3>Jurisdiction of the European Ombudsman</h3>

<p>Institutions and bodies that fall within the European Ombudsman's
jurisdiction include the following:</p>
<ul><li>The <a shape="rect" href="european_commission.html">European
    Commission</a> </li>
  <li>The <a shape="rect" href="council_of_the_european_union.html">Council of
    the European Union</a> </li>
  <li>The <a shape="rect" href="european_parliament.html">European
    Parliament</a> </li>
  <li>The <a shape="rect" href="court_of_auditors.html">Court of Auditors</a>
  </li>
  <li>The <a shape="rect" href="european_court_of_justice.html">Court of
    Justice</a> (except in its judicial role) </li>
  <li>The <a shape="rect" href="http://eesc.europa.eu/index_en.asp">European
    Economic and Social Committee</a> </li>
  <li>The <a shape="rect" href="http://cor.europa.eu/en/Pages/home.aspx">Committee of the Regions</a>
  </li>
  <li>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ecb.int/">European Central Bank</a>
  </li>
  <li>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.eib.org/">European Investment
    Bank</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.europol.net/">Europol</a> </li>
  <li>Any other European Union body. </li>
</ul><p>The European Ombudsman cannot deal with complaints concerning national,
regional or local authorities of member states, even when the complaints are
about European Community law. If the European Ombudsman is unable to
investigate your complaint, he or she will do their best to advise you of
another body that could help. This may be a national ombudsman, a regional
ombudsman or committee on petitions. The European Ombudsman liases regularly
with national and regional ombudsmen, as some complaints are more appropriately
dealt with on a national or regional level.</p>

<p>Ireland appoints an <a shape="rect" href="../../national_government/standards_and_accountability/office_of_the_ombudsman.html">Ombudsman</a>
to deal with complaints relating to <a shape="rect" href="../../government_departments/departments_of_state.html">Government
departments</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../../local_and_regional_government/local_authorities.html">local
authorities</a>, the <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/how_health_is_organised/health_boards.html">Health Service
Executive (HSE)</a> and other public bodies in Ireland. </p>

<h3>Who can complain to the European Ombudsman?</h3>

<p>If you are a citizen of a member state of the European Union or are living
in a member state, you are entitled to make a complaint to the European
Ombudsman. Businesses, associations or other bodies with a registered office in
a member state (e.g., public authorities) may also lodge a complaint with the
European Ombudsman. </p>

<h3>What happens when you complain?</h3>

<p>The European Ombudsman has wide powers of investigation. The institutions
and bodies of the European Community must supply the European Ombudsman with
any information he or she requests and give him or her access to the files
concerned. Member States must also provide the European Ombudsman with
information that may help to clarify instances of maladministration by European
Union institutions and bodies. </p>

<p>There are several ways in which the European Ombudsman can attempt to solve
your problem. </p>

<p>When the European Ombudsman tells the relevant institution about a complaint
he or she has received, the institution can take steps to solve the problem.
This is called <span>settled by the institution.</span></p>

<p>If maladministration is found and the case is not settled during the
inquiry, the European Ombudsman will try to find a <span>friendly
solution</span> to satisfy you.</p>

<p>If this fails, he or she can make a <span>draft recommendation</span> to the
institution, calling on it to take the necessary steps to put the
maladministration right. </p>

<p>If the institution does not accept his or her recommendation, he or she can
make a <span>special report</span> to the European parliament. </p>

<h3>How long do you have to wait for results?</h3>

<p>The European Ombudsman deals with complaints as quickly as possible. He or
she aims to acknowledge the receipt of complaints within one week, decide
whether to open an inquiry within one month and close inquiries within one
year. </p>

<h3>How to complain</h3>

<p>To complain to the Ombudsman, you should write to him or her in any of the
21 Treaty languages, setting out clearly who you are, which institution or body
of the European Community you are complaining about and the grounds for your
complaint. </p>

<p>A complaint must be made within two years of the date when you got to know
the facts on which your complaint is based. </p>

<p>You do need not be individually affected by the maladministration but you
must already have contacted the institution or body concerned, for example, by
writing a letter. </p>

<p>The European Ombudsman will examine your complaint and you will be informed
of the outcome of his or her investigation. </p>

<p>The European Ombudsman does not deal with matters that are currently before
a court or that have already been settled by a court. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/atyourservice/interactiveguide.faces">You
can lodge your complaint online</a>. You can also write a simple letter to the
European Ombudsman or you may prefer to fill out and post or fax a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/showResource?resourceId=1235463789310_form_en.pdf&amp;type=pdf&amp;download=true&amp;lang=en">European

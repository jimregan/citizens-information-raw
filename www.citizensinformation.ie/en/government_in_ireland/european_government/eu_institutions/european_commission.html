<p>The European Commission is based in Brussels in Belgium. It also has offices
in Luxembourg, representations in all EU countries and delegations in many
capital cities around the world.</p>

<p>It is made up of 28 Commissioners, one from each Member State. </p>

<p>The Commission has a number of important functions:</p>
<ul><li>The Commission initiates legislation. It makes proposals for European
    laws, which are sent to the Council and European Parliament for amendment
    and approval. </li>
  <li>The Commission acts as a guardian of the EU treaties. It ensures that EU
    legislation is applied by all Member States. It can institute proceedings
    against Member States or businesses that fail to comply with EU law. </li>
  <li>The Commission acts as an executive body - it manages policies and the
    annual budget. </li>
  <li>The Commission represents the EU on the international stage. It
    negotiates trade and co-operation agreements with non-EU countries. </li>
</ul><p>The President of the Commission is nominated by common agreement of the
Governments of the Member States after consultation with the <a shape="rect" href="european_parliament.html">European Parliament</a>. Once the President is
nominated, the other members of the Commission are selected and agreed. In
practice, the Government of each Member State nominates a Commissioner
according to its own selection procedure. This means that the Commission
reflects a variety of talents and vocations such as politicians, lawyers, civil
servants and academics. The Parliament must then vote to approve the
appointment of the President and the other members of the Commission. If the
Parliament should refuse to appoint one or more of the Commissioners, the
selection process must start again. Members of the Commission are appointed for
a renewable term of 5 years.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission/">The current
Commission</a> will be in office from 2014 to 2019. The President of the
Commission is appointed for a renewable 5 year term. </p>

<p>Commissioners are given a portfolio which is his/her area of responsibility.
It is up to the President of the Commission to decide which Commissioner will
be responsible for each policy area/portfolio and to reshuffle these
responsibilities (if necessary) during the Commission's term of office.
Commissioners act independently in the interests of the EU. They do not
represent the interests of their own Member State. </p>

<p>Each Commissioner appoints a cabinet of his/her own choice headed by the
<em>chef de cabinet</em>. The cabinet consists of a small group of counsellors
(usually about five) who assist him/her in the preparation of Commission
decisions.</p>

<p>As well as the cabinets, the Commission's personnel is organised into
specialist departments called "Directorates General" which are in turn divided
into Directorates and then into Units. At the head of each department, there is
a Director General responsible to the relevant Commissioner.</p>

<p>To assist the Commissioners in the performance of their duties, there is a
staff of about 23,000 people employed and paid by the Commission. This staff
comes from all of the Member States and includes language experts, lawyers,
experts in particular fields such as agriculture or industry and administrative
staff. The entire Commission may be forced to resign en masse by the European
Parliament. Two-thirds of the votes cast and at least half of the MEPs must
pass a motion of censure of the Commission. </p>

<p>The Commission meets once a week to adopt proposals, finalise policy papers
and make decisions. Decisions are taken by a simple majority vote. Once a
decision is taken, it becomes Commission policy and has the full support of all
Commissioners.</p>

<p>The European Commission Representation in Ireland offers a public
information centre with information on all aspects of Europe.</p>

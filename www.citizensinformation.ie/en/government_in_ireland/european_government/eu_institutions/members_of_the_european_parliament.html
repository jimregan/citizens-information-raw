<h3>Role of Members of the European Parliament</h3>

<p>Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) meet to discuss and vote on
Commission proposals for one week a month at the European Parliament in
Strasbourg in France. This is called a <em>plenary sitting</em>. There are
additional plenary sittings in Brussels. The Parliament may meet in
<em>extraordinary session</em> if the majority of its members request it, for
example, if a very urgent matter arises.</p>

<p>Parliamentary committees generally meet for 2 weeks a month in Brussels so
that they are close to the <a shape="rect" href="european_commission.html">European Commission</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="council_of_the_european_union.html">Council of the European Union</a>.
</p>

<p><a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/ep-live/en/schedule">All
parliamentary debates</a> are interpreted in the Union's 24 working languages:
Bulgarian, Croatian Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French,
German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Irish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltesese,
Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovakian, Slovenian, Spanish and Swedish. All
parliamentary documents are translated into and published in the 24 languages.
Irish became the 23rd official and working language on 1 January, 2007.</p>

<p>The Parliament's work is usually a four-stage process:</p>
<ol><li>The relevant parliamentary committee appoints a member as
    a<em>rapporteur</em> to draft a report on a Commission proposal</li>
  <li>The <em>rapporteur</em> submits his/her draft report to the committee for
    discussion</li>
  <li>After consideration, the draft report is put to the vote and possibly
    amended</li>
  <li>The report is then discussed and debated in plenary session at the
    Parliament, amended and put to the vote. Once it has voted, the Parliament
    has adopted its position on the matter.</li>
</ol><p>As well as adopting legislative proposals and the budget, the Parliament is
involved in scrutinising the work of the Commission and the Council of the
European Union by putting oral questions to the members of the those
institutions at plenary sittings. </p>

<p>MEPs are paid the same salary as members of their national parliaments. This
means that Irish MEPs are paid the same salary as members of DÃ¡il Eireann.
However, on top of their salaries, MEPs are also paid an amount to cover the
costs incurred by them in the performance of their duties and the recruitment
of assistants. These allowances may be cut if MEPs do not take part regularly
in the work of the plenary sittings. There are proposals to change the system
so that all MEPs are paid the same salary.</p>

<p>In the Parliament, MEPs sit in <a shape="rect" href="european_parliament_political_groups.html">political groups</a>, not in
national groups. The Parliament currently has 8 political groups plus some
non-attached or independent Members.</p>

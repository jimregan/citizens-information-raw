<p>The European Council defines the EU's overall political direction and
priorities. It is not one of the EU's legislating institutions, so it does not
negotiate or adopt EU laws. The European Council is also responsible for
defining <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/strategic-guidelines-jha/">strategic
guidelines for the area of freedom, security and justice</a>.</p>

<p>The members of the European Council are the heads of state or government of
the EU member states, the <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/european-council/president/">European
Council President</a> and the President of the <a href="european_commission.html">European Commission</a>. The EUâ€™s <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/mogherini_en">High
Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy</a> also takes part when
foreign affairs are discussed.</p>

<h3>Council meetings</h3>

<p>European Council meetings are essentially summits where EU leaders meet to
decide on broad political priorities and major initiatives. The Council meets
at least twice every 6 months in Brussels. Meetings are chaired by the European
Council President. The President of the <a href="european_parliament.html">European Parliament</a> attends the start of
each meeting, to outline the European Parliament's views. Other people, such as
the President of the <a href="http://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html">European Central
Bank</a>, may be invited to attend meetings, depending on the issues being
discussed.</p>

<p>The European Council mostly takes its decisions by consensus. However, in
certain specific cases outlined in the EU treaties, it decides by unanimity or
by qualified majority. If a vote is taken, neither the European Council
President nor the Commission President takes part.</p>

<h3>European semester role</h3>

<p>The European Council has a formal role to play in the <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/european-semester/">EU's
annual European semester process</a>. This is the EU's yearly cycle of economic
and fiscal policy coordination.</p>

<p>At its annual March meeting, the European Council assesses both the economic
situation in the EU and progress towards the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm">Europe 2020</a> targets. It
then gives policy orientations on fiscal, economic and structural reforms.</p>

<p>At its June meeting, the European Council endorses the final
country-specific recommendations, which set out priorities for each member
state for the next 12-18 months.</p>

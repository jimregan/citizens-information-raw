<p>The Court of Auditors has its headquarters in Luxembourg and is composed of
28 members, one from each member state. Each member state suggests a candidate
who is appointed by the <a shape="rect" href="council_of_the_european_union.html">Council of the European Union</a> in
consultation with the European Parliament for a renewable term of 6 years </p>

<p>Members of the Court of Auditors are independent and have experience in the
field of audit of public finances. The court members elect their president for
a term of 3 years. </p>

<p>The main task of the Court of Auditors is to audit the accounts and oversee
the implementation of the budgets of the institutions of the European Union. It
aims to improve financial management of EU money and to report to EU citizens
on how EU money is used. It draws up an annual report at the end of each
financial year. This is forwarded to the other institutions and must be
published in the <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/oj/direct-access.html">Official Journal of the
Community</a> so that any person can study the budget and spending of any
particular EU institution. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?language=EN&amp;id=146">European
Parliament</a> is the institution that represents the citizens of the Member
States. About 503 million European citizens in 28 countries are currently
represented by 766 representatives at the European Parliament. The Parliament
meets and deliberates in public at the Parliament buildings in Strasbourg in
France. </p>

<p>The first direct <a shape="rect" href="../../elections_and_referenda/european_elections/european_elections.html">elections
to the European Parliament</a> were held in June 1979 and are held every 5
years in the month of June. </p>

<p>There are a broad <a shape="rect" href="european_parliament_political_groups.html">range of political groups at
the European Parliament</a>. Usually, MEPs join a political group at the
Parliament and sit and vote with that group. <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/public/staticDisplay.do?language=EN&amp;id=150">MEPs
of the European Parliment</a> are not obliged to vote with their political
groups. The European Parliament has an elected president who oversees all the
activities of the Parliament and its various parts. </p>

<p>The Parliament has three main powers:</p>
<ul><li>The power to legislate. This power is shared with the <a shape="rect" href="council_of_the_european_union.html">Council of the European
    Union</a>. In most situations, <a shape="rect" href="../eu_law/european_laws.html">European laws</a> are made by a
    co-decision procedure. This means that the Council and the Parliament
    jointly adopt law. The Parliament can make amendments to legislation under
    this procedure. However, there are certain important areas, for example,
    tax legislation, where the Parliament may only give an opinion as to
    whether a proposed piece of legislation can become law. </li>
  <li>The power of the purse. This power is also shared with the Council. The
    Parliament supervises spending by the EU and it also adopts the annual
    budget for the EU. It has the last word on spending on the European
    Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, cultural and
    educational programmes, humanitarian aid and refugee programmes. However,
    when it comes to spending on agriculture and spending arising from
    international agreements, the Parliament can propose modifications but the
    Council has the final say. </li>
  <li>The power of democratic supervision. The Parliament supervises all
    Community activities. It sets up committees of inquiry to investigate
    certain matters. It also plays a crucial role in supervising the <a shape="rect" href="european_commission.html">European Commission</a>. The
    Commission must submit reports to the Parliament on its activities and must
    answer written or oral questions during <em>Question Time</em>. If
    two-thirds of the Parliament vote in favour of a motion of censure against
    the Commission, the entire Commission is forced to resign. </li>
</ul><p>The European Parliment also has powers where enlargement of the European
Union is concerned. The European Parliment monitors the negotiations between
the EU and countries that wish to join the EU, such as, Turkey. At the end of
the negotiating process the European Parliment has to agree to their membership
of the EU. If the European Parliment says no, there is no appeal mechanism. </p>

<h3>Visiting the European Parliament</h3>

<p>The Parliament receives groups of visitors in its three places of work,
Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg, not only during part-sessions but also
outside part-sessions. Visits last approximately one to three hours and include
a talk, given by a European Parliament official, on what the Parliament is and
how it works, followed by a question and answer session. Some visits include a
video presentation or an exchange of views with an MEP. Find out <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?language=EN&amp;id=50">more

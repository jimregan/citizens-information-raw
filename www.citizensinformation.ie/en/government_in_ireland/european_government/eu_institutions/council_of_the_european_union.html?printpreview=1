<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/homepage?lang=en">Council of the European
Union</a> is the main decision making body in the EU. With the entry into force
of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009, it has become an official EU
institution. </p>

<p>The Council consists of one government minister from every member state.
Although there is just one Council, different groups of ministers meet
depending on what topic is being discussed at the weekly meeting. For example,
if the issue to be discussed at the Council is agriculture, the ministers for
agriculture from each member state will attend and sit as the Council.</p>

<p>The Council of the European Union has three essential functions:</p>
<ul><li>The power to legislate. The Council shares this power with the <a shape="rect" href="european_parliament.html">European Parliament</a>. In
    most situations, <a shape="rect" href="../eu_law/european_laws.html">European laws</a> are made by a
    co-decision procedure. This means that the Council and the Parliament
    jointly adopt proposals for legislation that have come from the <a shape="rect" href="european_commission.html">European Commission</a>. The
    Council and the Parliament can make amendments to the legislation under
    this procedure. However, there are certain important areas, for example,
    tax legislation, where the Parliament may only give an opinion as to
    whether a proposed piece of legislation can become law. </li>
  <li>Co-ordination of the economic policies of member states. Every year, the
    Council drafts guidelines for the economic policies of member states. These
    are then made into a recommendation and their implementation by member
    states is supervised by the Council. </li>
  <li>The power to approve the budget of the EU. This power is shared with the
    Parliament. The Parliament supervises spending by the EU and it also adopts
    the annual budget for the EU. It has the last word on spending on the
    European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, cultural and
    educational programmes, humanitarian aid and refugee programmes. However,
    when it comes to spending on agriculture and spending arising from
    international agreements, the Parliament can propose modifications but the
    Council has the final say. </li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l6fba0">The power to legislate</h2>

<h3>Ordinary legislative procedure</h3>

<p>The usual method of making European Union (EU) decisions is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>The Commission makes a proposal </li>
  <li>The Council and the Parliament discuss it and each may make changes </li>
  <li>The final decision is made by the Council and the Parliament jointly
    (this is known at present as the co-decision procedure). </li>
</ul><p>The Treaty of Lisbon calls this the ordinary legislative procedure and
extends it to a number of new areas.</p>

<h3>Special legislative procedures</h3>

<p>There are specific decision-making procedures (called special legislative
procedures in the Treaty of Lisbon) in relation to 2 areas:</p>
<ul><li>Common foreign and security policy - decisions are made by the
  Council</li>
  <li>Area of freedom, security and justice – some decisions are made as
    under the ordinary legislative procedure while others are made by the
    Council. </li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l33051">Voting in the Council</h2>

<p>There are different ways that the Council makes its decisions. Some
decisions must be made unanimously, for example, decisions in relation to
defence and taxation. In practice, most decisions are made by consensus. If
there is no consensus, decisions in most areas may be made by <em>qualified
majority voting</em> (QMV). </p>

<h3>Changes to the voting system</h3>

<p>The system of QMV used to make decisions was changed on 1 November 2014. The
change was agreed in the Lisbon Treaty. The new QMV system is sometimes called
the double majority system. </p>

<p>If a decision is being made after a proposal has been made by the Commission
(this is the usual way in which decisions arise), then a qualified majority
means that the following two conditions must be met:</p>
<ul><li>55% of the member states must agree: that means at least 16 member states
    at present (there are 28 member states at present) and</li>
  <li>Those supporting must represent 65% of the EU population (the population
    is about 506 million at present so those supporting must represent 329
    million)</li>
</ul><p>In order to prevent a decision being made, a blocking minority will have to
include at least four member states – this means that if there are less than
four member states opposed to a decision then the qualified majority will be
treated as having been reached.</p>

<p>In some cases, only certain member states take part in decisions, for
example, the member states that have adopted the euro make certain decisions in
relation to it and the members of the Schengen area make certain decisions
about it. In these cases, the percentages apply to the participating member
states only.</p>

<p>If a decision is being made in cases where there has not been a proposal
from the Commission, the following two conditions must be met:</p>
<ul><li>72% of the member states must agree: that means at least 21 member states
    at present and</li>
  <li>Those supporting must represent 65% of the EU population</li>
</ul><p>If only certain member states are taking part in these decisions, the
percentages apply to those member states only. A blocking minority must include
at least the number of participating states representing 35% of the population
of the participating states plus one.</p>

<h3>Transitional arrangements</h3>

<p>There are transitional arrangements in place for the period to 31 March
2017. During that time, a member state may ask for the application of the old
QMV system (see below) rather than the new system. There is also a mechanism
for dealing with cases where the blocking minority is nearly reached.</p>

<h4>Old system of QMV</h4>

<p>Under the old system of QMV, each member state’s vote was given a
weighting. This was related, but not directly proportionate to the population;
smaller member states had a greater share than their populations would warrant.
Since July 2013, the number of votes each country could cast was as follows:
</p>
<ul><li>Germany, France, Italy and the UK: 29 </li>
  <li>Spain and Poland: 27 </li>
  <li>Romania: 14</li>
  <li>Netherlands: 13 </li>
  <li>Belgium, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary and Portugal: 12 </li>
  <li>Austria, Bulgaria and Sweden: 10 </li>
  <li>Croatia, Denmark, Ireland, Lithuania, Slovakia and Finland: 7 </li>
  <li>Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Luxembourg and Slovenia: 4 </li>
  <li>Malta: 3 </li>
  <li>Total number of votes: 352 </li>
</ul><p>A qualified majority was reached:</p>
<ul><li>If a majority of member states approved and </li>
  <li>If a minimum of 260 votes was cast in favour. </li>
</ul><p>In addition, a member state could ask for confirmation that the votes in
favour represented at least 62% of the total population of the European Union.
If this was found not to be the case, the decision would not be adopted.</p>

<p>The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights lists the civil, political, social and
economic rights which are recognised by the European Union (EU). These are
listed under the headings of Dignity, Freedoms, Equality, Solidarity,
Citizens’ Rights, and Justice and there are specific principles which apply
to specific groups such as older people, children and people with disabilities.
These rights are derived from a number of sources including existing EU law,
the Social Charters of the EU and the Council of Europe, the European
Convention on Human Rights and the constitutional traditions of the member
states. </p>

<p>All the member states have ratified the European Convention on Human Rights.
The Treaty of Lisbon allows for the EU itself to accede to that Convention.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C:2007:306:TOC">Treaty
of Lisbon</a> gives the Charter the same legal value as the main treaties. The
Charter applies to the EU institutions and to the member states when they are
implementing EU law. The Charter does not extend the application of EU law or
give the EU any new area of competence. </p>

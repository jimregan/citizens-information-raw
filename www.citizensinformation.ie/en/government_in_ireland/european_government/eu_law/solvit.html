<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>As a citizen of the European Union (EU) you can go to another EU country to
live, study, work or retire. Your rights in these areas are contained in the
Internal Market law of the EU. They may be subject to certain conditions and
limits. Member states of the EU/EEA are mainly responsible for implementing
these rules and properly applying them. Occasionally, citizens and businesses
of EU/EEA member states who move and conduct business between member states
face problems from the possible misapplication of Internal Market law by member
states. You may have the right to appeal these administrative decisions. Here
we explain how to appeal these decisions through the SOLVIT service and the
steps you need to take if you wish to make an appeal. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://ec.europa.eu/solvit/site/index_en.htm">SOLVIT</a> service is an
EU/EEA service that attempts to resolve problems faced by citizens and
businesses caused by the misapplication of Internal Market law without the need
for legal action. SOLVIT is a free, confidential service that is available to
anyone throughout the EU who feels they have not been able to avail of their
Internal Market rights because the administration in another member state is
misapplying Internal Market law.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>In order to bring an issue to SOLVIT you must be an EU/EEA citizen. Your
complaint must be in relation to the misapplication of Internal Market law by
an EU/EEA member state. (See below for a list of websites and organisations
where you can check what your Internal Market rights are). It is important to
be aware that the SOLVIT <span>service cannot help in certain cases</span> (see
‘Cases where SOLVIT cannot help’ below). If, however, SOLVIT agrees to take
your case, it will confirm within 1 week that it will act on your behalf. The
normal timeframe for resolution of appeals is 10 weeks, however this may be
extended in certain circumstances. </p>

<h3>What sort of areas can SOLVIT help with?</h3>
<ul><li>Voting rights </li>
  <li>Residence Permits </li>
  <li>Protection of Personal Data </li>
  <li>Employment Rights </li>
  <li>Recognition of Professional Qualifications: (i.e., doctors, nurses,
    engineers, etc.) </li>
  <li>Social Security </li>
  <li>Border Controls </li>
  <li>Motor Vehicle Registration </li>
  <li>Access to Education </li>
</ul><h3>Cases where SOLVIT cannot help</h3>
<ul><li>Instances where legal proceedings are already under way </li>
  <li>Where the problem relates to a legal obstacle, e.g. where the problem
    concerns an obstacle that results from a legal provision of national law.
    In this situation, it is unlikely that an informal system such as SOLVIT
    would be able to provide redress </li>
  <li>Where deadlines under national law need to be respected </li>
  <li>Where the problem is a business-to-business or business-to-consumer one.
    In the event of a Business-to-Consumer issue, you need to contact your
    nearest European Consumer Centre. In the event of a Business-to-Business
    issue, you will need to seek redress through the Courts. </li>
</ul><p>SOLVIT works as part of the national Government of each member state, so
there is a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/solvit/contact/index_en.htm">network of
SOLVIT centres</a> through the EU. </p>

<p>If you are not certain of your rights (i.e., whether you have a valid
complaint), you may like to get in touch with the following <span>before</span>
referring the matter to SOLVIT. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://europa.eu/europedirect/index_en.htm">Europe
Direct</a> provides a free telephone and e-mail service and acts as a first
point of contact for information about the EU. It offers information on a wide
range of subjects including the rights of EU citizens. It can also refer users
to the best source of advice at EU, national, regional and local levels.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://europa.eu/youreurope/advice/index_en.htm">Your
Europe Advice</a>: Provides expert legal advice on the rights of citizens in
the EU</p>

<p>There is also <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/youreurope/business/index_en.htm">advice for the
business community in the EU</a>.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://een.ec.europa.eu/">Enterprise Europe
Network</a>: Provides information, advice and assistance to Small Business
Enterprises in the EU</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/home_en">The European
Commission Representation in Ireland</a> can give free legal advice on your
single market rights. </p>

<p>You can read more about the process of making an appeal under ‘How to
apply’ below. </p>

<h3>Outcomes of using the SOLVIT service</h3>

<p>Proposed solutions through the SOLVIT service are non-binding on the person
making the complaint. If the applicant is unhappy with the proposed solution,
or if the problem goes unresolved, more formal proceedings (i.e., legal
proceedings at national or Community level) can be initiated. </p>

<p>It is also important to note, that SOLVIT does not provide advocacy services
on behalf of citizens or businesses in the EU. They do not have any role in
influencing policy, administration, etc. However, the European Commission
closely monitor each SOLVIT centre, checking the type, volume and nature of
appeals and to ensure that caseloads are progressing. </p>

<p><span>This is a free service – there is no charge for making an appeal to
the service. </span></p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You should submit your complaint to the <a shape="rect" href="http://ec.europa.eu/solvit/site/centres/addresses/index.htm#ireland">SOLVIT
service online</a>. You should include as much detail as possible. Your local
SOLVIT Centre (known as the "Home" SOLVIT Centre) will contact you within 1
week. If you have a valid cause for complaint, your local SOLVIT Centre will
forward it to the SOLVIT Centre in the other member state where the problem has
occurred (known as the "Lead" SOLVIT Centre).</p>

<p>The two SOLVIT Centres will liaise with each other during the period of
investigation and your Home SOLVIT Centre will keep you informed of progress,
and the proposed solution.</p>

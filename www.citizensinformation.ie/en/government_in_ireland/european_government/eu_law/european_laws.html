<p>The fundamental laws or rules of the European Union (EU) are set out in the
Treaties. All treaties must be agreed and ratified by the member states. A
treaty is ratified when it becomes part of the law of the member states. </p>

<p>The most important treaty is the <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:11957E/TXT:EN:NOT">Treaty
of Rome</a>, which created the European Economic Community in 1957. Since the
Treaty of Rome, there have been a number of treaties agreed and ratified by all
the member states; </p>
<ul><li>The <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:11965F/TXT:EN:NOT">Merger
    Treaty</a> in 1967, which merged the institutions of the three communities
  </li>
  <li>The <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:11986U/TXT:EN:NOT">Single
    European Act in 1986</a>, which provided for completion of the single
    market </li>
  <li>The <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:11992M/TXT">Treaty
    on European Union (the Maastricht Treaty)</a> in 1992, which provided for
    political and economic union amongst the member states </li>
  <li>The <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:11997D/TXT">Treaty
    of Amsterdam in 1997</a>, which made some changes to the powers of the
    institutions of the EU and paved the way for EU enlargement </li>
  <li>The <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12001C/TXT">Treaty
    of Nice 2001</a> which made further changes to the powers and structures of
    the institutions to facilitate enlargement</li>
  <li>The <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C:2007:306:TOC">Treaty
    of Lisbon 2007</a> which came into effect on 1 December 2009 made changes
    to how decisions are made at EU level.</li>
</ul><p>The Treaty of Lisbon amended the EU's two core treaties, the Treaty on
European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community. The latter
was renamed the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In addition,
several Protocols and Declarations were attached to the Lisbon Treaty. The
europa.eu website has <a href="http://europa.eu/european-union/law/treaties_en">more information on the
Lisbon Treaty</a>. </p>

<p>Treaties are the primary source of EU law but there are also secondary
sources of EU law; the institutions of the EU have the power to make
legislation. This power is shared between the <a shape="rect" href="../eu_institutions/european_commission.html">European Commission</a>, the
<a shape="rect" href="../eu_institutions/council_of_the_european_union.html">Council of the
European Union</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="../eu_institutions/european_parliament.html">European Parliament</a>.
Under the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/welcome">European
citizens' initiative</a>, one million EU citizens from at least 7 EU countries
can call on the European Commission to propose legislation on matters where the
EU has competence to legislate.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>There are different types of secondary legislation:</p>
<ul><li>Regulations. These are laws that apply to everyone including all member
    states. Regulations become part of national law and are enforceable in
    national courts immediately once they come into force. They do not need to
    be brought in by any national legislation. </li>
  <li>Directives. A Directive is a form of order to member states to implement
    national legislation to achieve a specific result. It is up to the national
    governments to decide on the form and method of the legislation necessary
    to achieve that result. Usually, a Directive will specify a deadline for
    the implementation of legislation. </li>
  <li>Decisions. A decision is addressed to a limited and defined group of
    persons, e.g., one member state or a corporation. They are binding upon
    those to whom they are addressed. </li>
  <li>Recommendations and opinions. These are not binding - they are simply
    recommendations. </li>
</ul><p>EU legislation is published in the <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOIndex.do?ihmlang=en">Official Journal of the
Community</a> and the date that it comes into effect is stated in the Journal.
The Official Journal is published every working day and consists of a number of
sections including legislation, information and notices and public tenders. You
can search for EU legal texts on the <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/index.htm">EUR-Lex website</a>. One of the
most important aspects of the European Union is that its legislation is
superior to all national legislation. This means that European law is supreme.
Nothing in our national laws can override or take precedence over an EU law.</p>

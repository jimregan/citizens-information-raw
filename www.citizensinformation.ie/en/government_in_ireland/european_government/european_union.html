<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of certain
countries in Europe. Since July 2013, there are 28 member states in the
European Union: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic,
Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Ireland,
Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal,
Romania, Spain, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The EU has grown out of 3 communities founded after World War II to
establish peace and prosperity in Europe. The European Coal and Steel Community
was set up in 1951, the European Atomic Energy Commission was founded in 1957
and the European Economic Community was also founded in 1957.</p>

<p>The fundamental laws of the EU are set out in the various <a href="https://europa.eu/european-union/law/treaties_en">treaties agreed and
ratified</a> by the member states. A treaty is ratified when it is formally
accepted by the member state.</p>

<p>The most important treaty is the Treaty of Rome, which created the European
Economic Community in 1957. Since the Treaty of Rome, the following treaties
have been agreed and ratified by all the Member States: the Merger Treaty in
1967, the Single European Act in 1986, the Treaty on European Union (the
Maastricht Treaty) in 1992, the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997, the Treaty of Nice
in 2002 and the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009.</p>

<p>The European Union has 4 main aims:</p>
<ul><li>To establish European citizenship. This means protection of fundamental
    human rights and freedoms. </li>
  <li>To ensure freedom, security and justice. This means co-operation in the
    field of justice and home affairs. </li>
  <li>To promote economic and social progress. This involves the single market,
    the euro, environmental protection and social and regional development.
  </li>
  <li>To assert Europe's role in the world. </li>
</ul><p>The European Union is run by 5 main institutions:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="eu_institutions/european_parliament.html">The
    European Parliament</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="eu_institutions/council_of_the_european_union.html">The Council of
    the European Union</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="eu_institutions/european_commission.html">The
    European Commission</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="eu_institutions/european_court_of_justice.html">The
    Court of Justice</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="eu_institutions/court_of_auditors.html">The Court
    of Auditors</a> </li>
</ul><p>There is also the <a href="eu_institutions/european_council.html">European Council</a> which
defines the EU's overall political direction and priorities.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lca00f">Joining the European Union</h2>

<p>Under Article 49 of the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12016M/TXT">Treaty
on European Union</a> any European country may apply for membership if it
respects the democratic values of the EU and is committed to promoting them. A
country wishing to join the EU submits a membership application to the Council
of the European Union which asks the European Commission to assess the
applicant’s ability to meet the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/policy/conditions-membership/index_en.htm">conditions
for membership (Copenhagen criteria)</a>. If the Commission’s opinion is
positive, the Council of the European Union must then agree upon a negotiating
mandate. Negotiations are then formally opened.</p>

<p><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/policy/steps-towards-joining/index_en.htm">Information
on the steps towards joining</a> is available on the European Commission’s
website.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l846dc">Leaving the European Union</h2>

<p>Under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union any member state may decide
to withdraw from the EU. The member state must notify the European Council of
its intention. The EU must negotiate an agreement with the member state,
setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the
framework for its future relationship with the EU. The agreement is negotiated
in accordance with Article 218(3) of the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12016E/TXT">Treaty
on the Functioning of the European Union</a>.</p>

<p>The agreement is concluded on behalf of the EU by the Council of the
European Union, if it has the approval of a qualified majority of the member
states, not including the member state that is leaving. The qualified majority
must be at least 72% of the members of the Council of the European Union and
representing at least 65% of the population of the member states.</p>

<p>The EU treaties cease to apply to the member state from the date of entry
into force of the withdrawal agreement or, if there is no agreement, 2 years
after the original notification unless the European Council unanimously decides
to extend this period.</p>

<p>On 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) voted to leave the EU. The UK
leaving the EU is known as ‘Brexit’ (short for ‘Britain’ and
‘exit’). You can read more in our <a href="../../reference/guides/brexit.html">guide to Brexit</a>. </p>

<p>Getting married is a big decision and is one of the most significant events
in someone's life. Aside from the excitement involved in planning your big day,
there are rules and procedures you must follow in order to marry in Ireland.
There are also rules and procedures if you are ordinarily resident here and
choose to marry abroad. Here, we start at the beginning and guide you through
the various things you need to know. </p>

<p>Aside from the rules about how and where you can marry, marriage will
immediately affect lots of areas of your life. You may not be aware but your
legal status, your inheritance rights, and pensions are just some things that
will change. Many other areas of life will also change and we examine these and
other issues in this document. </p>

<h3>Requirements for marriage</h3>

<p>Couples of the same sex or opposite sexes can marry in Ireland. The minimum
age for getting married in Ireland is 18 years of age. If you are ordinarily
resident in Ireland and you wish to get married abroad, you must be aged at
least 18. However, there are some exceptions to this in the <a shape="rect" href="age_requirements_for_marriage.html">age requirements for marriage</a>.
Essentially, the age rule is the same, irrespective of whether or not you get
married in a religious, secular or civil ceremony. In addition, you must have
the capacity to marry. That is, you must freely consent to the marriage and
have the capacity to understand what marriage means. Read more about the <a shape="rect" href="legal_prerequisites_for_marriage.html">legal requirements
for marriage in Ireland</a>. </p>

<h3>Notification requirements for marriage</h3>

<p>Since November 2007 anyone marrying in Ireland (irrespective of whether they
are an Irish citizen or a foreign national) must give 3 months' notification
before they marry. You must make this notification in person to any Registrar.
The requirement to give a 3-month notice does not apply to civil partners whose
civil partnership was registered in Ireland. If civil partners choose to marry,
their civil partnership is automatically dissolved. </p>

<p>Find out <a shape="rect" href="notification_requirements_for_marriage.html">how to notify the
Registrar</a> that you will be getting married in Ireland. </p>

<h3>Different ways of getting married</h3>

<p>We provide a <a shape="rect" href="different_legal_ways_of_getting_married.html">guide to the legal ways of
getting married in Ireland</a> only. These include <a shape="rect" href="civil_marriage_ceremony.html">civil marriage ceremonies</a> and <a shape="rect" href="religious_marriage_ceremonies.html">religious and secular
marriage ceremonies</a>. Requirements of different faiths and secular bodies
may differ, so check in advance with the relevant member of the clergy or body
for further information. </p>

<p>Since November 2007, no matter how you marry (i.e., through a civil, secular
or religious ceremony), the registration process is the same. You are issued
with a Marriage Registration Form (MRF) by the Registrar, following
notification, which gives you authorisation to get married. You give it to the
person who will be solemnising your marriage. Following the marriage ceremony,
the completed MRF should be given to a Registrar, within one month of the
marriage ceremony, for <a shape="rect" href="registration_of_marriage.html">the
marriage to be registered</a>. </p>

<h3>Getting married outside of Ireland</h3>

<p>If you are an Irish citizen and are planning to marry abroad, you should
realise that <span>the legal validity of your marriage is governed, in part, by
the laws of the country in which you marry</span>. In most, if not all cases,
the legal formalities abroad are very different to those in Ireland. You can
read information for <a shape="rect" href="getting_married_abroad.html">Irish
citizens planning to marry abroad</a>.</p>

<h3>Changes to your status following your marriage</h3>

<p>Getting married affects many areas of your life in Ireland. These range from
life insurance and pensions, to inheritance, <a shape="rect" href="../separation_and_divorce/presumption_of_paternity.html">presumption of
paternity</a> and even <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/taxation_of_married_people.html">taxation</a>.

<p>Getting married is an exciting time in life <span>and</span> a serious
commitment. It is important to be aware of the various formalities and
procedures in advance to help you to plan and organise your wedding. It is also
very important to be aware of how marriage will affect your legal status and
understand how this change in your life will affect your rights and
entitlements. </p>

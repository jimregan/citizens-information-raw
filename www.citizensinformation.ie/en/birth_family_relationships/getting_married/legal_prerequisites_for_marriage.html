<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Getting married is a serious commitment. Marriage is a legally binding
contract that will affect both parties (and, to a certain extent, their
children) for all of their lives. There are a number of strict rules and
regulations governing marriage. The first set of rules specifies who may and
may not marry each other and in what circumstances.</p>

<p>Once you have fulfilled these conditions and are sure that you are entitled
to marry, you should consider <span>how</span> you wish to marry. There are <a shape="rect" href="different_legal_ways_of_getting_married.html">several
different ways (religious, secular and civil) of solemnising a marriage</a> so
that it is legally binding. </p>

<p>Please note that this section deals only with the legal requirements for the
capacity to marry. If you are marrying through a religious or secular ceremony,
you should discuss their requirements with the celebrant of your marriage.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To contract a legally valid marriage in Ireland the parties to the marriage
must:</p>
<ul><li>Have the capacity to marry each other </li>
  <li>Freely consent to the marriage. Free consent <span>may</span> be absent
    if, at the time of the marriage, a person is suffering from intoxication,
    brain damage, mental disability, mental instability or insanity <span>to
    the extent that he/she is not able to understand the implications of
    marriage. </span>Additionally, if someone agrees to marry because of
    threats or intimidation, his/her apparent consent may also be invalid and
    the marriage may be void. </li>
  <li>Observe the necessary formalities </li>
</ul><h3>Capacity to marry</h3>

<p>To be legally entitled to marry, both of you must fulfil <span>all</span> of
the following requirements at the time the marriage takes place. Both parties
must:</p>
<ul><li>Be over 18 years of age or have a Court Exemption Order if this is not
    the case. </li>
  <li>Have given the Registrar 3 months' <a shape="rect" href="notification_requirements_for_marriage.html">notification of the
    marriage</a> (or have a Court Exemption Order if this is not the case) and
    have been issued by the Registrar with a Marriage Registration Form. A
    couple whose civil partnership was registered in Ireland do not have to
    give the 3 months' notice.</li>
  <li>Be either single, widowed, <a href="../separation_and_divorce/divorce_decrees.html">divorced</a>, a
    former civil partner of a civil partnership that ended through death or <a href="../separation_and_divorce/dissolution_decrees.html">dissolution</a>,
    or have had a <a href="../civil_annulment/">civil annulment</a> of a
    marriage or civil partnership or a valid foreign divorce or dissolution.
    (If you are marrying your civil partner you do not need to have your civil
    partnership dissolved before marrying. It will be automatically dissolved
    when you marry.)</li>
  <li>Have the mental capacity to understand the nature of marriage </li>
  <li>Not be related by blood or marriage to a degree that prohibits you in law
    from marrying each other. If you are <span>related to your proposed
    spouse</span> by blood or by marriage, you should <a shape="rect" href="http://www.lawsociety.ie/Pages/Find-a-Firm/">contact a solicitor</a>
    to ensure that you do not fall within the prohibited degree of
    relationship. (See "Further information" below on prohibited degrees. </li>
</ul><p>If <span>either party doesn't fulfil even one</span> of the above
requirements, any subsequent marriage ceremony is <span>legally void</span>.</p>

<p>Note: Since 16 November 2015 the requirement to be of opposite sex does not
apply.</p>

<h3>Age requirement</h3>

<p>If you are ordinarily resident in the State, the minimum age at which you
may marry is 18 years (unless you have a Court Exemption Order). This is the
case even if you marry outside of Ireland. Even if you are not ordinarily
resident in the State, you must be over 18 years of age if you wish to marry
someone in Ireland.</p>

<p>There is no requirement for parental consent to a marriage, irrespective of
the ages of the parties concerned.</p>

<h4>Exemption from age requirement</h4>

<p>In certain special circumstances, you may be able to get a Court Exemption
Order allowing the marriage to proceed even if one or both parties are under
18. The court will require you to show:</p>
<ul><li>That there are good reasons for your application</li>
  <li>That the granting of such an Exemption Order is in the best interests of
    the parties to the intended marriage</li>
</ul><p>You should contact either the Circuit Family Court or the High Court for
details on how to proceed. This is an informal procedure. You may apply in
person (without hiring a solicitor). There is no court charge for an
application for a Court Exemption Order. However, if you hire a solicitor to
represent you, you will have to pay him/her.</p>

<h3>A foreign divorce</h3>

<p>Not all foreign divorces are recognised under Irish law. Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1986/act/24/enacted/en/html">Domicile
and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986</a>, a foreign divorce will only
be recognised in Ireland if at least one spouse was <em>domiciled</em> in the
state that granted the divorce when the proceedings started. You may have to
provide good evidence that this was the case and, therefore, that the divorce
is valid under Irish law. Under <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1422886426094&amp;uri=URISERV:l33194">EU
Regulation 2201/2003 (“the Brussels II bis”)</a> it is the spouse’s
habitual residence that determines a court’s right to grant a divorce.</p>

<p>Where the divorce comes within EU regulations, it is sufficient to confirm
that both parties to the divorce were notified of the proceedings and had an
opportunity to give evidence to the court which granted the divorce.</p>

<p>Where EU regulations do not apply, certain information as to place of birth,
countries of residence and other relevant facts must be supplied on a
questionnaire provided by the Registrar. The information is then forwarded to
the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/General-Register-Office.aspx">General
Register Office</a>, whose consent is required before the marriage ceremony can
take place. </p>

<p>If the General Registrar is of the opinion that the foreign divorce is
valid, then the new marriage can go ahead. If not, you can provide additional
information to prove validity or else you can apply for a hearing before the
Circuit Court. The Court's decision on the validity of a foreign divorce in
Irish law is final and binding, although you may, of course, appeal to a higher
court. If the Court decides that your foreign divorce is not binding, your only
option if you wish to remarry in Ireland may be to get a divorce under Irish
law.</p>

<h3>A foreign dissolution</h3>

<p>If a legal dissolution of a civil partnership is granted outside Ireland, it
will be recognised under Irish law if the Minister of Justice and Equality has
made an order recognising the appropriate class of legal relationship in the
country in which the dissolution was granted.</p>

<h3>Prohibited degrees of relationship</h3>

<p>Prohibitions apply to marriage between certain people related by blood or
marriage. A couple who fall within the prohibited degrees of relationship
cannot marry. These prohibitions are based on:</p>
<ul><li>Consanguinity – blood relationship including half blood (half blood
    means having one parent in common, for example a half-brother) </li>
  <li>Affinity – relationship by marriage </li>
</ul><p>The prohibited degrees apply to a wide range of family relationships and
include marital and non-marital offspring.</p>

<p>An adopted child is within the prohibited degrees in relation to its natural
family and adoptive parents. However, it would appear an adopted child can
marry the child of their adoptive parents.</p>

<p>You can marry your deceased spouse's sister or brother. This also applies if
your marriage ends due to a divorce rather than a death.</p>

<p>There is no legal restriction on the marriage of first cousins. </p>

<p><strong>Consanguinity – blood relationships</strong></p>

<p>You may not marry your:</p>
<ul><li>Grandmother or grandfather</li>
  <li>Mother or father</li>
  <li>Father’s sister (aunt) or brother (uncle)</li>
  <li>Mother’s sister (aunt) or brother (uncle)</li>
  <li>Sister or brother </li>
  <li>Father’s daughter (half sister) or son (half brother) </li>
  <li>Mother’s daughter (half sister) or son (half brother)</li>
  <li>Daughter or son</li>
  <li>Son’s daughter (granddaughter) or son (grandson)</li>
  <li>Daughter’s daughter (granddaughter) or son (grandson)</li>
  <li>Brother’s daughter (niece) or son (nephew) </li>
  <li>Sister’s daughter (niece) or son (nephew) </li>
</ul><p><strong>Affinity – relationship by marriage</strong></p>

<p>You may not marry your:</p>
<ul><li>Grandfather’s or grandmother’s spouse (step-grandmother or
    step-grandfather) </li>
  <li>Father’s or mother’s spouse (stepmother or stepfather) </li>
  <li>Father’s brother’s or sister's spouse </li>
  <li>Mother’s brother’s or sister's spouse </li>
  <li>Son’s or daughter’s spouse</li>
  <li>Son’s son’s or daughter’s spouse</li>
  <li>Daughter’s son’s or daughter’s spouse </li>
  <li>Brother’s son’s or daughter’s spouse </li>
  <li>Sister’s son’s or daughter’s spouse</li>
  <li>Spouse's grandmother (grandmother-in-law) or grandfather
    (grandfather-in-law) </li>
  <li>Spouse's mother (mother-in-law) or father (father-in-law) </li>
  <li>Spouse's father’s sister or brother</li>
  <li>Spouse's mother’s sister or brother </li>
  <li>Spouse's daughter (stepdaughter) or son (stepson) </li>
  <li>Spouse's son’s son or daughter </li>
  <li>Spouse's daughter’s son or daughter </li>
  <li>Spouse's brother’s son or daughter</li>
  <li>Spouse's sister’s son or daughter</li>

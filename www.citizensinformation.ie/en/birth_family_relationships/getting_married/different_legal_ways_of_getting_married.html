<p>Once you are sure that you have the <a shape="rect" href="legal_prerequisites_for_marriage.html">capacity to marry</a> you can
decide how you wish to marry in Ireland. You may choose a civil Registry Office
marriage or opt for marriage by religious or secular ceremony. Marriages that
take place in Ireland by certain specified religious or secular ceremonies or
by civil ceremony (that is, in a Registry Office or other approved place) are
equally valid and binding under Irish law.</p>

<p>Whether you decide on a religious, secular or civil ceremony you will
require a Marriage Registration Form which you obtain by fulfilling the <a shape="rect" href="notification_requirements_for_marriage.html">notification
requirements</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that this section deals only with the <span>legal
requirements</span> for a legally valid marriage. If you are marrying through a
religious or secular ceremony then you should discuss their requirements with
the celebrant of your marriage.</p>

<p>The following procedures apply to anyone getting married in Ireland, whether
you are an Irish citizen or a foreign national. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you are getting married by <a shape="rect" href="civil_marriage_ceremony.html">civil ceremony</a> in a Registry Office or
other approved place, you should approach the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/bdm/contactus/">Registrar of Civil
Marriages</a> for the district in which you intend to marry for information on
how to proceed. If you are getting married by <a shape="rect" href="religious_marriage_ceremonies.html">religious or secular ceremony</a>,
you should approach the authorities of the body concerned for advice on how to
proceed. Since November 2007, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/General-Register-Office.aspx">General
Register Office</a> maintains a <a shape="rect" href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/RegisterOfSolemnisers.pdf">Register
of Solemnisers of Marriage (pdf)</a> and anyone solemnising a civil, secular or
religious marriage must be on the Register. The Register can be inspected at
any Registration Office. </p>

<p>A marriage that is legally binding may be celebrated in Ireland in a civil
ceremony, in a secular ceremony or in a religious ceremony which is also
recognised by civil law as being a civil contract.</p>

<p>The appropriateness of the venue you choose for a religious or secular
marriage ceremony is the responsibility of the body under whose auspices the
marriage is being performed. Civil marriage ceremonies are held in a Registry
Office or, since November 2007, in any venue, providing the venue has been
approved by the Registrar. You need to contact the Registrar to arrange to have
the venue inspected.</p>

<h3>Renewing your wedding vows</h3>

<p>Under the law in Ireland, someone who is already married cannot get married
again (even if it is to the same person). This effectively means that you
cannot renew your wedding vows in a civil ceremony in Ireland. </p>

<p>However, there is a long tradition of "church blessings" in Ireland. This is
where Irish people who have married in civil ceremonies abroad, marry in a
religious ceremony the next time they are home. Sometimes, people living in
Ireland have their marriage blessed in a religious ceremony, to commemorate a
special anniversary or event. </p>

<p>Contact an appropriate local clergyman who should be able to put you in
touch with a counterpart in Ireland. If you live in Ireland and would like to
have your marriage blessed, you should get in touch with your local clergyman.

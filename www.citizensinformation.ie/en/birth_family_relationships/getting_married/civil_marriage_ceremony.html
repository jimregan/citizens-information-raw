<p>Following the commencement of <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0003/sec0045.html">Part 6
of the Civil Registration Act 2004</a> on 5 November 2007, to legally marry you
require a Marriage Registration Form (MRF) from a Registrar and whoever is
solemnising your marriage must be on the <a shape="rect" href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/RegisterOfSolemnisers.pdf">Register
of Solemnisers (pdf)</a>. The Registrar issues the MRF when you give your <a shape="rect" href="notification_requirements_for_marriage.html">3 month
notification to the Registrar</a>.</p>

<p>It is also now possible to get married by civil ceremony in the office of a
Registrar of Civil Marriages or in some other venue that is approved by a
Registrar.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you are getting married by civil ceremony in a Registry Office or other
approved place, you should approach the Registrar of Civil Marriages for the
district in which you intend to marry for information on how to proceed. There
is no requirement to live in the district where you want to get married.</p>

<p>As well as arranging your civil marriage ceremony there is also a
requirement to give 3 months notification to a Registrar. This does not have to
be the same Registrar.</p>

<h3>Venue</h3>

<p>A civil ceremony can be held in a Registry Office or some other venue that
is approved by a Registrar. A Registrar will also have to be available to
solemnise the marriage. </p>

<p>If you want to get married in a venue other than the Registry Office you
should contact the Registry Office for the district the venue is located in to
arrange to have it approved. This may involve the Registrar inspecting the
venue. </p>

<p>According to the legislation the place where the solemnisation takes place
must be open to the public. The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/act/34/section/16/enacted/en/html#sec16">Civil
Registration (Amendment) Act 2014</a> amended the legislation to clarify that a
place that is open to the public means:</p>
<ul><li>A building that is open to the public or</li>
  <li>A courtyard, garden, yard, field or piece of ground that is open to the
    public and is near to and usually enjoyed with a building that is open to
    the public</li>
</ul><p>The <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Getting_Married.aspx#sect2">guidelines for
marriage venues</a> are available on the General Registrar's website. To ensure
the venue is approved in time for your wedding you should arrange for the
approval well in advance of notifying the Registrar.</p>

<p>There will be an additional fee for a civil ceremony held in a venue other
than a Registry Office.</p>

<h3>Marriage Registration Form</h3>

<p>If you fulfill the 3 months notification requirements and there is no
impediment to you getting married, the Registrar will issue you with a Marriage
Registration Form (MRF) giving you permission to marry. You should give the MRF
to the Registrar who will be solemnising the marriage before the marriage
ceremony. </p>

<p>Immediately after the marriage ceremony, the MRF should be signed by you and
your spouse, the two witnesses and the Registrar. The Registrar will <a shape="rect" href="registration_of_marriage.html">register the marriage</a> as
soon as possible after the marriage. </p>

<h3>Marriage ceremony</h3>

<p>The marriage ceremony is solemnised by the Registrar, who is on the Register
of Solemnisers. The ceremony must be performed in the presence of two witnesses
aged 18 or over. During the ceremony you and your intended spouse must make two
declarations: </p>
<ul><li>That you do not know of any impediment to the marriage </li>
  <li>That you accept each other as husband/wife/spouse</li>
</ul><h3>Interpretive services</h3>

<p>If either you, your intended spouse or either of the two witnesses does not
have sufficient knowledge of the language in which the ceremony is being held
to understand the ceremony, then the services of an interpreter must be
provided. It is your responsibility to provide the services. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Since the commencement of <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0003/sec0045.html#partvi">Part
6 of the Civil Registration Act 2004</a> in November 2007, anyone notifying a
Registrar of their intention to get married in Ireland must give 3 months'
notification in person to the Registrar. This applies to all marriages, whether
<a shape="rect" href="civil_marriage_ceremony.html">solemnised by a
Registrar</a> or according to <a shape="rect" href="religious_marriage_ceremonies.html">religious or secular rites and
ceremonies</a>, unless you intend marrying your civil partner and your civil
partnership was registered in Ireland. The Registrar does not have to be the
Registrar for the district where you live or where you intend getting
married.</p>

<p>You need to make an appointment with the Registrar in order to give the
notification. In order to ensure the notification is given at least 3 months
before the date you intend getting married on, it is advisable to arrange the
appointment well in advance. </p>

<p>A couple in a civil partnership who wish to marry should contact the
Registrar who will guide them through the process. </p>

<p>If you plan to get married by civil ceremony and a different Registrar will
be solemnising the marriage, you must also contact the Registrar's Office for
the district you intend getting married in. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>A couple getting married are required to give notification in person of
their intention to marry to a Registrar at least <strong>3 months</strong>
before the intended date of the marriage. The requirement to give a 3-month
notice does not apply to civil partners whose civil partnership was registered
in Ireland – see 'Civil partners' below.</p>

<p>The notification can be given to any Registrar. When you make the
appointment with the Registrar you will be informed what information and
documents you need to bring with you.</p>

<p>As well as bringing original or certified copies of the documents, you also
need to bring photocopies of the documents. In the case of a passport, a good
quality, colour photocopy or a passport-sized photo is required.</p>

<p>If a document is not written in English or Irish, a certified English
translation from an independent, verifiable, translation company must be
provided.</p>

<p>Generally, you and your intended spouse will each be required to bring the
following:</p>
<ul><li>Passport as identification</li>
  <li>Birth Certificate – if not issued by the Civil Registration Service in
    Ireland it must bear an apostille stamp from the relevant embassy (if
    possible) or a letter from that embassy attesting the authenticity of the
    certificate should be supplied. This does not apply to birth certificates
    issued by Denmark, Italy, France, Belgium or Latvia</li>
  <li>Original final divorce decrees in respect of all previous divorces if
    divorced – if it was a foreign divorce contact the Registrar for
    instruction</li>
  <li>Original dissolution decrees in respect of all previous civil
    partnerships if you have a civil partnership dissolution</li>
  <li>Final decree of nullity and a letter from the relevant court confirming
    that no appeal was lodged, if you were in a civil partnership or marriage
    that was annulled by an Irish court</li>
  <li>Deceased spouse's death certificate and previous civil marriage
    certificate if either of you is widowed</li>
  <li>Documentary evidence of immigration status if not a citizen of Ireland or
    an EU member state</li>
  <li>A <em>Letter of Freedom to Marry</em> or other documentary confirmation
    of civil status from county of origin if not a citizen of Ireland</li>
</ul><p>You will also have to provide information about the intended marriage such
as:</p>
<ul><li>Whether it will be a civil, secular or religious ceremony</li>
  <li>The intended date and location of the marriage</li>
  <li>Details of the proposed solemniser of the marriage</li>
  <li>The names and dates of birth of the 2 proposed witnesses</li>
  <li>A <a href="../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">PPS
    number</a> is required for all parties serving notice of intention to
    marry, who have a current or a future address within the State</li>
</ul><p>You should download and complete the <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/bdm/marriagesinireland/DATA_SET_NOTIFICATION.pdf">Data
Capture Form (pdf)</a>, and bring it with you.</p>

<p>You will also have to pay a notification fee.</p>

<p>If you, your intended spouse, the witnesses or the solemniser has a limited
knowledge of English, the services of an interpreter is required. The
interpreter must be from an independent, verifiable translation company and be
present for both the notification and the marriage.</p>

<p>When you meet the Registrar you will be required to sign, in the Registrar's
presence, a declaration that you know of no lawful impediment to your proposed
marriage.</p>

<p>The Registrar will issue an acknowlegement to both of you and the proposed
solemniser of the marriage confirming the date of receipt of notification. This
does not give you permission to marry.</p>

<p>Under the Civil Registration Act 2004 (as amended by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/act/34/enacted/en/html">Civil
Registration (Amendment) Act 2014</a>), the Registrar has the right to
investigate and decide whether an intended marriage would be a <a href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/pressoffice/Pages/pr180815.aspx">marriage of
convenience for immigration purposes</a>. </p>

<p>If all the information required has been supplied and there is no impediment
to the marriage, the Registrar will issue you with a Marriage Registration Form
(see below).</p>

<p>You can find <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/bdm/marriagesinireland/notificationrequirements.html">more
information on notification requirements</a> on the Health Service Executive
(HSE) website.</p>

<h3>Civil partners</h3>

<p>If your civil partnership ceremony took place in the State and you now wish
to marry your civil partner, you must, by appointment, attend the Registrar at
least 5 days (or as determined by the Registrar) before the intended date of
the ceremony to sign a declaration in their presence that there is no
impediment to the marriage. You pay a reduced fee.</p>

<p>If your civil partnership ceremony took place abroad you will be required to
give the Registrar 3 months’ notice of your intention to marry and complete
the standard preliminaries for a valid marriage.</p>

<h3>Postal notification</h3>

<p>If either of you are living abroad or are unable to attend a Registration
Office due to serious illness, you should contact a Registrar to get permission
to make your 3-month notification by post. If permission is granted, the
Registrar will send you a form which you must complete and return. </p>

<p>You will still have to make arrangements to meet the Registrar at least 5
days before you get married in order to make the declaration. This is required
before a Marriage Registration Form can be issued.</p>

<h3>Court Exemption Order</h3>

<p>In certain special circumstances, for example, in the case of very serious
illness, you may be able to get a Court Exemption Order allowing the marriage
to proceed without the 3-month notification. You should contact either the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.courts.ie/offices.nsf/WebCOByJurisdiction?OpenView&amp;Start=1&amp;Count=30&amp;Expand=3#3">Circuit
Family Court</a> or the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.courts.ie/offices.nsf/WebCOByJurisdiction?OpenView&amp;Start=1&amp;Count=30&amp;Expand=2#2">High
Court</a> in the area in which either of you lives for details on how to
proceed.</p>

<p>This is an informal procedure. You may apply in person (without hiring a
solicitor). There is no court charge for an application for a Court Exemption
Order. However, if you hire a solicitor to represent you, you will have to pay
them. The court will require you to show:</p>
<ul><li>That there are good reasons for your application </li>
  <li>That the granting of such an Exemption Order is in the best interests of
    the parties to the intended marriage. </li>
</ul><p>If you are granted a Court Exemption Order, you still have to make
arrangements to meet the Registrar at least 5 days before you get married in
order to make the declaration. This is required before a Marriage Registration
Form can be issued.</p>

<h3>Marriage Registration Form</h3>

<p>A Marriage Registration Form (MRF) is like a marriage licence. It gives
authorisation for a couple to marry and you require one in order to get married
in Ireland. Providing there is no impediment to the marriage, the Registrar
will issue you with an MRF. If you bring all the documentation and information
required to the meeting with the Registrar, the Registrar may be able to issue
the MRF immediately.</p>

<p>If the marriage does not take place within 6 months of the date of marriage
given on the MRF, a new MRF will be required if you still intend to marry. You
will be required to repeat the notification process. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l20b4f">Cost</h2>

<p>The standard notification fee is €200. There is a reduced notification fee
of €50 for same-sex couples who are already in a civil partnership that is
registered in Ireland and now wish to marry.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>Three months' notification can be given to any Registrar but must be given
in person. Civil partners who do not have to give 3 month's notification must
attend the Registrar at least 5 days (or as determined by the Registrar) before
the intended date of the ceremony.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you or your partner are an Irish citizen(s) and are thinking of getting
married outside of Ireland, you should realise that <span>the legal validity of
your marriage is governed, in part, by the laws of the country in which you
marry</span>. In most, if not all cases, the legal formalities abroad are very
different to those in Ireland. For example, a church marriage abroad is usually
a purely religious ceremony <span>with no legal effect</span>. Because it is
not recognised in law in the country in which it takes place, it cannot be
regarded as a legal marriage in Ireland. This is the case even though a
marriage in the same church or denomination in Ireland can be legally
binding.</p>

<p>It is very important, therefore, that you <span>make sure to meet all the
legal requirements</span> of the country you are marrying in. You should
<span>contact the civil registration office</span> in that country to find out
what is required. </p>

<h3>Registration of marriages abroad</h3>

<p>Marriages of Irish citizens abroad are registered in the country where they
occur. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/General-Register-Office.aspx">General
Register Office</a> <span>has no function</span> in advising on, or the
registration of marriages of Irish citizens that take place abroad. Marriages
that take place outside the state are <span>not</span> normally registered in
Ireland.</p>

<p>Your foreign marriage certificate will usually be accepted for official
purposes in Ireland where you need to show evidence that you are married. If
the certificate is in a foreign language, you must provide an official
translation or a translation from a recognised translation agency.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Although you must meet the foreign requirements for formalities, you are
still bound by Irish law as far as the <a shape="rect" href="legal_prerequisites_for_marriage.html">capacity to marry is
concerned</a>. For example, your marriage abroad will not be recognised under
Irish law if one or both of you was ordinarily resident in Ireland and one or
both of you was aged under 18 at the time of the marriage and did not have a
Court Exemption Order. </p>

<p>You may require a Certificate of Freedom to Marry to get married in some
foreign countries. This may also be called "Certificate de Coutume" or
"Certificate of Nulla Osta". </p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you are not sure of the legal requirements for marriage in the country
you will be marrying in, <span>contact the civil registration office</span> in
that country in advance to find out what is required. </p>

<p>To apply for a Certificate of Freedom to Marry, Irish citizens living abroad
should contact their nearest <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/embassies/irish-embassies-abroad/">Irish embassy</a>
or <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/travel/our-services/marriage-and-civil-partnership-abroad/how-to-apply-for-certificate-of-freedom-to-marry/">apply
online</a> to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. </p>

<p>Irish citizens living in Ireland should <a href="https://www.dfa.ie/travel/our-services/marriage-and-civil-partnership-abroad/how-to-apply-for-certificate-of-freedom-to-marry/">apply
online</a> to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. If you are getting
married in Italy for example, your Certificate of Freedom to Marry will be sent
by the Department to the Irish embassy in Rome who will then forward it to the
district where you will be married. In most other cases, the Certificate of
Freedom to Marry will be issued by the Department and sent directly to you. </p>

<p>If you want to get a copy of your foreign marriage certificate, you should
contact the embassy or the civil registration office for the country
concerned.</p>

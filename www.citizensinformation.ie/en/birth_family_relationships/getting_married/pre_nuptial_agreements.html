<p>A pre-nuptial agreement (also called an ante-nuptial agreement) is an
agreement entered into by a couple before they get married. In some cases a
couple may enter into a post-nuptial agreement after they get married.</p>

<p>Pre-nuptial agreements vary according to each couple’s particular
circumstances but generally they make provision for financial and property
matters, and other issues, following the breakdown of the marriage. They can
cover issues such as lump sum payments, pensions, maintenance and custody. A
couple enters into an agreement in order to try and avoid a dispute if they
separate. Some pre-nuptial agreements cover issues arising during the marriage.
Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1965/en/act/pub/0027/sec0113.html#sec113">Section
113 of the Succession Act 1965</a> a spouse can renounce his/her <a href="../../death/the_deceaseds_estate/what_happens_the_deceaseds_estate.html">legal
right share</a> in a pre-nuptial agreement.</p>

<h3>Enforcing a pre-nuptial agreement</h3>

<p>There is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple intending to marry from
signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Such agreements can serve as guides for the
courts in <a href="../separation_and_divorce/judicial_separation.html">judicial
separation</a> and <a href="../separation_and_divorce/divorce_decrees.html">divorce</a> cases,
however, the courts are not obliged to enforce them.</p>

<p>Only pre-nuptial agreements entered into following independent legal advice
for both parties are likely to be taken into account. The court would have to
be satisfied that there had been a complete disclosure of assets before the
agreement was signed. It is also advisable for the agreement to provide for
reviews:</p>
<ul><li>Periodically</li>
  <li>If children are born</li>
  <li>If there is a major change in circumstances</li>
</ul><h3>Study Group on Pre-nuptial Agreements</h3>

<p>In December 2006 the Government set up a group to study and report on the
operation of the law with respect to pre-nuptial agreements since the
introduction of divorce in 1996, taking into account constitutional
requirements. In April 2007 the <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/PrenupRpt.pdf/Files/PrenupRpt.pdf">Report
of the Study Group on Pre-nuptial Agreements (pdf)</a> was published. The Study
Group held that pre-nuptial agreements were enforceable and capable of
variation under existing Irish legislation. The weight to be attached to an
agreement is determined by the courts in the light of the requirement for
proper provision and the relevant statutory criteria, for example, <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0033/sec0020.html#sec20">Section
20(2) of the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996</a>.</p>

<p>The report recommended that pre-nuptial agreements be legislated for by way
of introducing a new Section 16(2)A of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0026/index.html">Family
Law Act 1995</a> and new Section 20(3)A of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0033/index.html">Family
Law (Divorce) Act 1996</a> so that the courts would be required to have regard
to existing pre-nuptial agreements when making ancillary relief orders in
judicial separation and divorce proceedings. The report also recommended that
the legislation should contain procedural guidelines. A pre-nuptial agreement
would have to comply with general contractual principles and it recommended
that for it to be an enforceable agreement it must be:</p>
<ul><li>In writing, signed and witnessed</li>
  <li>Made after each party has received separate legal advice</li>
  <li>Made with full disclosure of financial information</li>
  <li>Made not less than 28 days before the marriage</li>
</ul><p>The report also recommended that pre-nuptial agreements be reviewable on
death. This is so that a court may make financial provision for a surviving
spouse who may be unfairly affected by the provisions of a pre-nuptial
agreement on the death of the other spouse in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>The report’s recommendations have not yet been implemented.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Since the commencement of <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0003/sec0045.html">Part 6
of the Civil Registration Act 2004</a> in November 2007, the registration
procedure for marriage is the same whether you are marrying in a Registry
Office or by religious or secular ceremony. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you are <a shape="rect" href="civil_marriage_ceremony.html">getting
married by civil ceremony</a> in a Registry Office or other approved place, you
should approach the Registrar of Civil Marriages for the district in which you
intend to marry for information on how to proceed. If you are <a shape="rect" href="religious_marriage_ceremonies.html">getting married by religious or
secular ceremony</a>, you should approach the authorities of the body concerned
for advice on how to proceed.</p>

<p>Since November 2007, a couple getting married are required to give
notification in person of their intention to marry to a Registrar at least 3
months before the intended date of their marriage. A couple in a civil
partnership who wish to marry should contact the Registrar who will guide them
through the process. The notification can be given to any Registrar.</p>

<p>If there is no impediment to your marriage, the Registrar will issue you
with a Marriage Registration Form (MRF) which gives you permission to marry. <a shape="rect" href="notification_requirements_for_marriage.html">Read more about
notification requirements here</a>.</p>

<p>You should give the MRF to whomever will be solemnising your marriage before
the marriage ceremony. Immediately after the marriage ceremony the MRF should
be signed by you and your spouse, the two witnesses and the person solemnising
the marriage.</p>

<h3>Registration</h3>

<p>If you get married by civil ceremony, the Registrar who solemnised the
marriage will register the marriage with the information on the MRF as soon as
possible after the ceremony. If you get married by religious or secular
ceremony, you should give the MRF within one month to a Registrar, for the
marriage to be registered. It does not have to be returned to the Registrar who
issued it.</p>

<p>Under Section 50 of the Civil Registration Act 2004, if the completed MRF is
not returned to a Registrar within 56 days of the intended date of marriage
recorded on the MRF, the Registrar can serve a notice on you requiring you to
return the MRF within 14 days of receiving the notice. If you do not comply
with this requirement, the Registrar can serve a notice on you requiring you to
attend on a particular date at the office of the Registrar (or other place
given in the notice) with the completed MRF. If you are unable to give the MRF
to the Registrar when you meet, you have a further 14 days to give it. </p>

<p>You cannot get your marriage certificate until the marriage is
registered.</p>

<h3>Registration of marriages outside Ireland</h3>

<p>Marriages of Irish citizens abroad are normally registered in the country
where they occur. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/General-Register-Office.aspx">General
Register Office</a> (central civil repository for records relating to births,
deaths and marriages in Ireland) <span>has no function</span> in the
registration of marriages of Irish citizen(s) that take place abroad, or in
advising on such marriages. Marriages that take place outside the State are
<span>not</span> registered in Ireland.</p>

<p>Your foreign marriage certificate will usually be accepted for official
purposes in Ireland where you need to show evidence that you are married. If
the certificate is in a foreign language, you must provide an official
translation or a translation from a recognised translation agency.</p>

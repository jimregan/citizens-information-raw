<p>Since the commencement of <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0003/sec0045.html#partvi">Part
6 of the Civil Registration Act 2007</a> in November 2007, to legally marry you

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you are intend getting married by religious or secular ceremony, you
should approach the authorities of the body concerned for advice on how to
proceed. You will be told what requirements that body has in order to get
married under their rites.</p>

<p>While a marriage ceremony can be performed according to the customs and
rites of the body, there are certain requirements that must be met in order for
the marriage to be legal.</p>

<h3>Register of Solemnisers</h3>

<p>The person solemnising the marriage must be on the <a shape="rect" href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/RegisterOfSolemnisers.pdf">Register
of Solemnisers (pdf)</a> which is maintained by the General Registrar. It lists
both civil registrars and the members of the various religious and secular
bodies who have been nominated by the bodies as solemnisers. It is available
for inspection at <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/bdm/contactus/">your local
registration office</a>.</p>

<h3>Witnesses</h3>

<p>The ceremony must be performed in the presence of two witnesses aged 18 or
over.</p>

<h3>Marriage Registration Form</h3>

<p>If you fulfill the <a shape="rect" href="notification_requirements_for_marriage.html">3 months notification
requirements</a> and there is no impediment to you getting married, the
Registrar will issue you with a Marriage Registration Form (MRF) giving you
permission to marry. You should give the MRF to the person who will be
solemnising the marriage in advance of the marriage ceremony.</p>

<p>Immediately after the marriage ceremony, the MRF should be signed by you and
your spouse, the two witnesses and the person who has solemnised the marriage.
The MRF should be returned within one month to a Registrar, for the <a shape="rect" href="registration_of_marriage.html">marriage to be
registered</a>. It does not have to be returned to the Registrar who issued
it.</p>

<h3>Marriage Ceremony</h3>

<p>While the marriage ceremony can be performed according to the customs and
rites of the religious or secular body, as part of the ceremony you and your
intended spouse must make two declarations:</p>
<ul><li>That you do not know of any impediment to the marriage </li>
  <li>That you accept each other as husband and wife </li>
</ul><p>The venue for the ceremony is a matter for the body. According to the
legislation the place where the solemnisation takes place must be open to the
public. This means that access to the venue for the general public must be
unrestricted.</p>

<h3>Interpretive Services</h3>

<p>If either you, your intended spouse, either of the two witness or the
solemniser does not have sufficient knowledge of the language in which the
ceremony is being held to understand the ceremony, then the services of an
interpreter must be provided. It is your responsibility to provide the
services.</p>

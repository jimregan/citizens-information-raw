<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Most couples get engaged to marry before they actually get married. At one
time, such an agreement to marry was considered a legally binding contract and
if the engagement was broken without lawful justification, the person
responsible could be sued for damages for breach of promise. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1981/en/act/pub/0022/index.html">Family
Law Act 1981</a> abolished legal action for breach of promise but it allows for
legal action where there is a dispute over property or finances between a
couple following a broken engagement or involving a third party.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the rules described here relate to engaged couples;
co-habitation in itself <strong>does not</strong> necessarily mean that they
are engaged to marry. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Gifts between an engaged couple</h3>

<p>When 2 people who are engaged give gifts (including an engagement ring) to
each other, there is a presumption that they are given on the condition that
the gifts will be returned (if requested to), should the engagement end. If one
of the engaged couple dies, however, it is presumed the gifts the deceased gave
were given without any conditions. So, the surviving fiancé(e) can keep the
gifts. It is possible to contest either of these presumptions in court if there
is evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>These presumptions only apply to gifts given during the engagement and does
not apply to gifts given before or after the engagement.</p>

<h3>Gifts from a third party</h3>

<p>Where someone gives an engaged couple or one of the couple a wedding gift,
there is a presumption (unless there is evidence to the contrary), that it is
given to both of them as joint owners. It is also presumed that the gift will
be returned (if requested to), should the engagement end and the marriage does
not take place for any reason. This includes the death of one of the engaged
couple. </p>

<p>A third party can also apply to the courts where one of a couple to a broken
engagement received a substantial benefit (not a wedding gift) from the third
party as a result of the engagement. For example, if a relative of one of the
couple carried out or paid for substantial work to improve a property which the
couple intended to use as the family home, the relative can apply to the courts
for compensation.</p>

<h3>Expenditure on preparations for marriage</h3>

<p>Where an engagement has ended and one of the couple has incurred substantial
expenses in preparation for the marriage (and hasn't benefited from the
expenses), that person may apply to the courts for compensation from their
ex-fiancé(e). One example might be expenses incurred in booking the wedding
reception, honeymoon and photographer. A third party (for example, a family
member or friend) who incurs expenditure on behalf of one of the couple in
preparation for the marriage and has not benefited, may also apply to the
courts for compensation. </p>

<h3>Property of engaged couples</h3>

<p>Under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0033/sec0044.html#zza33y1996s44">Section
44 of the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996</a> disputes about property between a
couple whose engagement has ended are treated in the same way as disputes
between a married couple who are separating or divorcing. This only applies to
property in which either or both of them had a beneficial interest while they
were engaged. It does not apply to property acquired after the engagement
ended. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l74039">Taking legal action</h2>

<p>Legal action must be taken within 3 years of the engagement ending. Such
actions are generally taken in the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/circuit_court.html">Circuit Court</a> but if very
valuable property is involved, a party to the proceedings may ask that it be
heard in the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/high_court.html">High
Court</a>. Contact a solicitor who will provide you with advice. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.lawsociety.ie/Pages/Find-a-Firm/">Contact
information for solicitors' firms throughout Ireland</a> is available from the
Law Society.</p>

<p>FLAC (Free Legal Advice Centres) is an independent, voluntary organisation
that operates a network of legal advice clinics throughout the country. These
clinics are confidential, free of charge and open to all. Contact your nearest

<p>If you are having a baby in Ireland there are various benefits and
entitlements relating to both employment and social welfare you may be able to
avail of depending on your circumstances. It is important to be aware of the
various supports available. The following information provides an overview of
this area. </p>

<h3>Health and safety</h3>

<p>If you become pregnant while in employment and you are exposed to certain
risks in the workplace, or you are involved in nightwork, (i.e. spend at least
three hours or 50% of your work between midnight-7am), you may be entitled to
<a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/health_and_safety/health_safety_work.html">health
and safety leave</a> from work. If you are entitled to health and safety leave
and you have sufficient social insurance contributions, you may also be
entitled to <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/health_safety_benefit.html">Health
and Safety Benefit</a> from the Department of Social Protection while on leave.
You may also be entitled to health and safety leave and Health and Safety
Benefit when you return to work following the birth (only if you are
breastfeeding).</p>

<h3>Antenatal classes</h3>

<p>Before the birth you are entitled to take paid time off work to attend one
set of <a shape="rect" href="before_your_baby_is_born/antenatal_visits.html">antenatal classes</a>.
This is a once-off right which covers all pregnancies while in employment. You
may also take reasonable time off for medical visits both before and after the
birth. Expectant fathers have a once-off right to attend two antenatal
classes.</p>

<h3>Maternity leave</h3>

<p>All female employees in Ireland, no matter how long they have been working,
are entitled to take <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/maternity_leave.html">maternity
leave</a> for a basic period of 26 weeks. At least two weeks have to be taken
before the end of the week of your baby's expected birth and at least four
weeks taken after. You can also avail of an additional 16 weeks unpaid
maternity leave. If a mother dies within 40 weeks of the birth, the father is
entitled to maternity leave from work.</p>

<p>During the basic period of maternity leave you may be entitled to <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/maternity_benefit.html">Maternity
Benefit</a> providing you satisfy the social insurance contribution
conditions.</p>

<h3>Paternity leave and Paternity Benefit</h3>

<p>New entitlements to <a shape="rect" href="../../employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/paternity_leave.html">paternity
leave</a> and <a href="../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/paternity_benefit.html">Paternity
Benefit</a> are available from 1 September 2016.</p>

<h3>Child benefits</h3>

<p>In general, <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child
Benefit</a> is payable from the first day of the month after the child is born.
It is paid at higher rates for multiple births such as twins or triplets. </p>

<h3>Social assistance</h3>

<p>If you are a <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical card
holder</a> you are entitled to a Maternity Cash Grant of â‚¬10.16 from the
Health Service Executive on the birth of your child. Apply to your <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/">Local Health Office</a>.</p>

<p>If your income is insufficient to meet the costs associated with your baby
you may be able to apply for an <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/exceptional_needs_payments.html">Exceptional
Needs Payment</a> from the Department of Social Protection's representative
(formerly known as the Community Welfare Officer).</p>

<p>If you are parenting alone you may be entitled to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One
Parent Family Payment</a> which is a means-tested payment from the Department
of Social Protection. You can receive Maternity Benefit at a reduced rate, if
you are getting One Parent Family Payment.</p>

<h3>Parental Leave</h3>

leave</a>. You are not entitled to pay from your employer while you are on

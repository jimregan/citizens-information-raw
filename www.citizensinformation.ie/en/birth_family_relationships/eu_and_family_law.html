<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The European Union (EU) has a limited role in family law matters. Each
individual member state has its own rules about separation, divorce,
maintenance of spouses and children, custody and guardianship and other family
law matters. The role of the EU is mainly concerned with ensuring that
decisions made in one country can be implemented in another. It also has a role
in trying to establish which country has jurisdiction to hear a particular
case. In effect, the EU does not have rules which govern, for example, who is
entitled to have custody or access but it does have rules which try to ensure
that custody and access orders made in one country can be put into effect in
another. </p>

<p>EU rules in relation to enforcement of matrimonial orders (divorce,
separation, annulment) and some parental responsibility orders (mainly custody
and access) came into effect in March 2001. A new regulation on matrimonial
matters and parental responsibility came into effect in March 2005. This did
not involve any significant change in the rules on matrimonial matters but it
did involve changes in the rules governing parental responsibility – see
'Parental responsibility' below. EU rules in relation to the enforcement of
maintenance orders came into effect in March 2002. A new regulation on
maintenance came into effect in June 2011 – see 'Maintenance' below.</p>

<h3>The problem of conflict of laws </h3>

<p>If all the parties to a family law dispute are from one country and are
living in that country then generally the dispute is heard by the courts of
that country and a decision is made and implemented in accordance with the laws
of that country. Problems arise when the parties are not living in the same
country or are not nationals of the same country. It may not be clear which
country’s courts should make the decisions, which country’s laws should be
applied and how the decisions made in one country can be implemented in
another. </p>

<p>Each country has its own rules about how this conflict of laws should be
dealt with. It is possible that several countries would have jurisdiction to
hear the dispute and that each would apply different laws. The procedures for
having judgements recognised and enforced in another country can be difficult
and sometimes impossible. Generally, if you have a judgement from a court in
one country, you have to go through another judicial process in another country
in order to have it implemented there (this process is known as
<em>exequatur</em>). </p>

<p>These problems arise between all countries and not only between EU member
states. A number of international conventions have been agreed dealing with
such conflicts of laws. These international conventions continue to apply
between EU member states and non-EU member states. The EU regulations in family
law matters apply in all the EU member states except Denmark – this means
that if there is a conflict of laws involving Denmark and another EU member
state, the matter is governed by the international conventions if they are
relevant.</p>

<h3>EU competence to deal with family law </h3>

<p>The EU is only entitled to make laws in areas where the treaties give it the
specific competence to do so. It has no specific competence to make laws in
relation to divorce, maintenance or parental responsibility. This means it
cannot make laws setting out the terms under which a divorce may be granted or
the responsibility of spouses to pay maintenance or how decisions on custody to
access to children are to be made.</p>

<p>However, the EU does have competence to promote judicial co-operation in
civil matters which have cross border implications. It has made a number of
regulations dealing with judicial co-operation in civil matters. In general,
these regulations are based on the principle of mutual recognition – that is,
that decisions lawfully made in one member state should be recognised and
enforced in other member states and the procedures for doing so should be as
simple as possible. The EU rules in the family law area generally build on the
international conventions which already existed but which were not always
implemented or did not have mechanisms to ensure implementation. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l10d0d">Maintenance</h2>

<p>The recognition and enforcement of maintenance orders in EU member states
was governed by <a shape="rect" href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_civil_matters/l33054_en.htm">Regulation
44/2001</a> of December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and
enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. This Regulation is
known as "the Brussels I Regulation" and had been in effect in Ireland since
March 2002. It replaced the <a shape="rect" href="http://curia.europa.eu/common/recdoc/convention/en/c-textes/brux-idx.htm">1968
Brussels Convention</a>. </p>

<p>In June 2011, <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1422886426094&amp;uri=URISERV:jl0024">Regulation
4/2009</a> of 18 December 2008, on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition
and enforcement of decisions and cooperation in matters relating to maintenance
obligations, amended Regulation 44/2001 by replacing the provisions of that
Regulation that apply to maintenance obligations. Regulation 4/2009, which is
commonly referred to as "the Maintenance Regulation", aims to enable a
maintenance creditor (you are owed money under a maintenance order) to obtain
easily, quickly and generally free of charge, an order which can readily be
enforced throughout the European Union. It does this by providing for common
rules in relation to jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement,
cooperation and standardised documents. It covers maintenance obligations which
arise from:</p>
<ul><li>Family relationships</li>
  <li>Parentage</li>
  <li>Marriage or affinity </li>
</ul><p>Under the Regulation, each member state has a Central Authority. The Central
Authority in Ireland is the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/Home">Department of Justice and
Equality</a>. The Central Authorities co-operate with each other in
facilitating the operation of the regulation. They also assist individuals in
relation to applications available under the Regulation, particularly with
regard to the transmission and receipt of applications, the initiation of
related proceedings for the establishment or modification of maintenance, and
for the enforcement of a maintenance decision. </p>

<p><a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_civil_matters/l33190_en.htm">Regulation
805/2004</a> of 21 April 2004 created a European Enforcement Order for
uncontested orders – including maintenance orders – that came into effect
in Ireland on 21 October 2005. Its provisions for maintenance orders were
replaced by Regulation 4/2009, except for European enforcement orders
concerning maintenance obligations issued by member states that are not bound
by the <a href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&amp;cid=133">2007
Hague Protocol</a> on the law applicable to maintenance obligations. The vast
majority of member states are bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol.</p>

<h3>Lugano Convention</h3>

<p>In 2007 the European Community signed a treaty on jurisdiction and the
recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters with
Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. The treaty is known as the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/world/agreements/prepareCreateTreatiesWorkspace/treatiesGeneralData.do?step=0&amp;redirect=true&amp;treatyId=7481">new
Lugano Convention</a> and came into force in January 2010. The Convention is
substantially the same as Regulation 44/2001 and applies between an EU member
state and one of the countries mentioned above.</p>

<h3>UN and Hague Conventions</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201268/volume-1268-A-3850-English.pdf">UN
Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance Payments (the New York
Convention)</a> was brought into effect for Ireland in November 1995 by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0028/index.html">Maintenance
Act 1994</a>. This Convention is designed to facilitate the recovery of
maintenance by a person living in one jurisdiction against a person living in
another. </p>

<p>In 2007, the Hague Conference on Private International Law adopted the
following two international instruments which are designed to facilitate the
international recovery of maintenance:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&amp;cid=131">2007
    Hague Convention</a> on the international recovery of child support and
    other forms of family maintenance. It revises two existing Hague
    Conventions relating to family support as well as the New York Convention.
    The <a href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.status&amp;cid=131">Convention
    entered into force</a> on 1 January 2013.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&amp;cid=133">2007
    Hague Protocol</a> on the law applicable to maintenance obligations. The
    European Union has applied the Protocol since 2011 on a provisional basis
    to all its member states except for Denmark and the UK. The <a href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.status&amp;cid=133">Protocol
    entered into force</a> on 1 August 2013.</li>
</ul><p>If you want to enforce a maintenance order in a country not covered by EU
Regulation 4/2009 or the Lugano Convention, you should contact the Central
Authority for Maintenance Recovery in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/Home">Department of Justice and
Equality</a> for help – see 'Where to apply' below. The Department is
responsible for transmitting and receiving maintenance.</p>

orders and agreements</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lb4507">Divorce, separation and annulment</h2>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/other/l33082_en.htm">Regulation
1347/2000</a> of 29 May 2000 (called "the Brussels II Regulation”) came into
effect in March 2001. It set out the rules on jurisdiction and the recognition
and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental
responsibility for children of both spouses. (Matrimonial matters includes
divorce, annulment and legal separation but does not include, for example, the
property consequences of marriage and the grounds for divorce.)</p>

<p>This regulation was replaced by <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1422886426094&amp;uri=URISERV:l33194">Regulation
2201/2003</a> (“the new Brussels II Regulation” or "the Brussels II bis”)
for cases arising on or after 1 March 2005 but its rules in relation to
matrimonial matters are virtually unchanged. A <a shape="rect" href="http://ec.europa.eu/civiljustice/publications/docs/guide_new_brussels_ii_en.pdf">Practice
Guide for the application of the new Brussels II Regulation (pdf)</a> is
available.</p>

<h3>Jurisdiction</h3>

<p>The Regulation does not set out one general rule about jurisdiction in
matrimonial matters. It provides that you may take a matrimonial action in the
courts of the member state where one or both of you are or were habitually
resident or the member state of your common nationality or your common
domicile. This means, of course, that it may be possible to take the action in
a number of states. The Regulation provides that once proceedings have started
in a particular member state, other states must refuse jurisdiction. The
Regulation does not deal with the question of which law applies. This is a
matter for the member state that has jurisdiction. For example, most countries
other than Ireland and the UK apply the law of the country of <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitual
residence</a> of the parties while Ireland and the UK apply the law of the
country of <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/moving_country_and_taxation/tax_residence_and_domicile_in_ireland.html">domicile</a>.</p>

<h3>Recognition of decisions </h3>

<p>The Regulation provides that a decision on a matrimonial matter made in one
member state must be recognised and enforced in the other states without any
special procedures. You do not have to go to court to have it recognised.
However, any interested party may ask the court in the other member state not
to recognise the decision. The court may refuse to recognise the decision:</p>
<ul><li>If such recognition is clearly contrary to public policy </li>
  <li>If the decision contradicts another decision </li>
  <li>If there were certain procedural defects – in particular if one party
    was not properly served with the relevant papers and did not put in an
    appearance as a result </li>
</ul><p>The court is not entitled to hear an appeal against the decision. </p>

<h3>The law applicable to international divorces </h3>

<p>As explained above, Regulation 2201/2003 does not determine what law applies
when an application for divorce is being considered. For example, if an Irish
person living in the UK wants to divorce a German spouse who is living in
France, which national law applies? </p>

<p><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:343:0010:0016:en:PDF">Regulation
1259/2010</a> of 20 December 2010 (known as "the Rome III Regulation")
implementing enhanced cooperation in the area of the law applicable to divorce
and legal separation was <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/judicialatlascivil/html/di_information_en.htm">adopted
by 14 EU member states.</a> It came into effect in those member states on 21
June 2012. Ireland and the UK have not opted into this Regulation. The
Regulation allows international couples in the member states where it applies
to agree in advance which law will apply to their divorce or legal separation,
as long as the agreed law is the law of the member state with which they have a
closer connection. In case the couple cannot agree, the judge can use a common
formula for deciding which country's law applies. This Regulation 1259/2010
does not affect the application of Regulation 2201/2003. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld8ff1">Parental responsibility</h2>

<p><a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_civil_matters/l33194_en.htm">Regulation
2201/2003</a> on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments
in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility came into
effect in March 2005. This Regulation replaced Regulation 1347/2000 which
applied from March 2001. The earlier Regulation only applied to judgments on
parental responsibility that were issued in the course of matrimonial
proceedings and it only applied to judgements in relation to the children of
both spouses. The 2003 Regulation applies to all decisions made by the courts
of member states in matters of parental responsibility. </p>

<p>The parents need not be married to each other. They need not be the
biological parents of the child in question. It is not confined to court
judgments. It also applies to agreements between parents if such agreements are
enforceable in the country where they were made. In general, such agreements
can be turned into court rulings and thereby made enforceable.</p>

<h3>What the 2003 Regulation covers</h3>

<p>The Regulation covers the following aspects of parental responsibility:</p>
<ul><li>Jurisdiction – what country should hear the case, whose laws should
    apply </li>
  <li>Recognition and enforcement – how decisions made in one country are to
    be recognised and enforced in another </li>
  <li>Co-operation between central authorities </li>
  <li>Specific rules on child abduction and access rights </li>
</ul><p>Parental responsibility includes rights of custody and rights of access,
guardianship, the placement of a child in a foster family or in institutional
care. The Regulation does not apply to proceedings which involve:</p>
<ul><li>Establishing and challenging paternity </li>
  <li>Judgments in relation to adoption </li>
  <li>The child's first and last names </li>
  <li>Age of majority </li>
  <li>Trusts and inheritance </li>
  <li>Measures taken following criminal infringements committed by children
  </li>
</ul><p>The Regulation also applies to certain measures concerning the child’s
property if they are related to the protection of the child. Measures that
relate to the child’s property, but which do not concern the protection of
the child, are covered by <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1422886426094&amp;uri=URISERV:230203_1">Regulation
1215/2012</a> known as Brussels I recast. It is for the judge to assess in the
individual case whether a measure relating to the child’s property concerns
the protection of the child or not.</p>

<h3>Jurisdiction</h3>

<p>The general rule is that the court which has jurisdiction in matters of
parental responsibility is the court of the country where the child is
habitually resident. Again, in general, once the matter is before the courts in
one country, that country continues to have jurisdiction even if the child has
lawfully changed country of residence. It is possible to have the case
transferred to the new country of residence if certain conditions are met and
if it would be in the best interests of the child.</p>

<p>The parents may agree to have the question of parental responsibility
decided in the court which has jurisdiction on the matrimonial matter or may
agree to have the case heard by the court of a country with which the child has
a close connection (for example, nationality).</p>

<p>If the child's habitual residence cannot be established, then the member
state in which the child is present has jurisdiction.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances, the court which has jurisdiction may refer the
case to another court if that other court is better placed to hear the case and
this is in the best interests of the child. This could arise, for example, if
the child’s habitual residence has changed. There are time limits on this
procedure. If a child’s habitual residence changes as a result of a wrongful
removal or retention, jurisdiction may shift only under very strict
conditions.</p>

<p>The Regulation also includes rules on what is to happen if the proceedings
are started in more than one member state.</p>

<p>In urgent cases, a court may take provisional protective measures even if
another member state has jurisdiction on the substantive issue.</p>

<h3>Co-operation between national authorities</h3>

<p>The Regulation creates a system of co-operation between central authorities
of the member states. These authorities are obliged to facilitate
communications between the courts of the relevant countries and must facilitate
agreements between parents through mediation or other means.</p>

<h3>Recognition and enforcement</h3>

<p>Judgements given in one member state must be recognised and enforced in
another member state. The court in the other member state may refuse to
recognise the order only on the grounds that:</p>
<ul><li>It would be manifestly contrary to that member state’s public policy
  </li>
  <li>The child was not given an opportunity to be heard (except in urgent
    cases) </li>
  <li>The judgment was given in the absence of a person who was not served with
    the documents instituting the proceedings in sufficient time and in such a
    way as to enable him/her to arrange for his/her defence </li>
  <li>A person claiming that the judgment infringes his/her parental
    responsibility was not given the opportunity to be heard </li>
</ul><p>If you are applying to a court in another member state for recognition and
enforcement, you are entitled to legal aid there if you were entitled in your
own state. You may also get help from the central authority in the country
where you are seeking recognition and enforcement.</p>

<p>In the cases of child abduction, it is not necessary to go through the court
procedure for recognition.</p>

<h3>Child abduction</h3>

<p>Child abduction is the unlawful removal or retention of a child. If you have
custody of a child and your child is abducted to another member state, you may
apply to that state for the return of the child. The courts of the member state
to which the child has been abducted can only refuse return of the child in
limited circumstances – for example, if there are not adequate safeguards to
ensure that there is no serious risk that return would expose the child to
harm.</p>

<p>In general, the court must order the immediate return of the child. You can
find out more in our document on <a shape="rect" href="services_and_supports_for_children/international_child_abduction.html">international
child abduction</a>.</p>

<h3>Access rights</h3>

<p>Access rights are directly enforceable in other member states. This means
that it is not necessary to go to court to declare that they are enforceable if
the court which issued the orders also issues the required certificate. (This
certificate guarantees that procedural safeguards have been respected – for
example, that all parties had an opportunity to be heard, the child had the
opportunity to be heard if that was appropriate.) It does not matter who holds
the access rights – it is usually a parent but can be a grandparent or other
family member depending on the national rules involved.</p>

<p>The certificate means that the judgement is treated in the new member state
as if it were a judgement of that state.</p>

<h3>Hague Conventions</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&amp;cid=24">Hague
Convention</a> of 25 October 1980 on the civil aspects of international child
abduction (“the 1980 Hague Convention”) and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&amp;cid=70">Hague
Convention (1996)</a> on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement
and cooperation in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the
protection of children continue to apply in cases where the 2003 Regulation
does not.</p>

<p>The European Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions
Concerning Custody of Children and on Restoration of Custody of Children <a shape="rect" href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/105.htm">(the
Luxembourg Convention)</a> applies to a number of European countries. It is now
of limited relevance because the EU Regulation or the Hague Convention covers
the relevant countries. </p>

<p>Both Conventions were signed in 1980. They were brought into effect in
Ireland in 1991 by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0006/index.html">Child
Abduction and Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1991</a>.</p>

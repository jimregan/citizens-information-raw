<p>When a child is removed from the person who has the <a shape="rect" href="../unmarried_couples/custody_of_children_and_unmarried_couples.html">legal
right to custody</a> of the child without that person’s consent it is called
child abduction. When the child is taken out of the country or is kept in
another country they are visiting it is called international child abduction.
There are two main aspects to international child abduction as follows:</p>
<ul><li>International child abduction is a criminal offence in Ireland. A parent
    or anyone else who unlawfully abducts a child may be convicted of the
    offence. (See 'Criminal offence' below) </li>
  <li>The question of arranging for the return of a child who has been abducted
    internationally is governed by international law. There are international
    Conventions and a European Union (EU) Regulation which set out the rules
    that apply. The EU Regulation applies to an abduction from one EU member
    state to another. An international Convention applies to cases to which the
    EU Regulation does not apply. (See 'Return of the child' below) </li>
</ul><h3>What is child abduction?</h3>

<p>Child abduction is the term used to describe a situation where a child is
removed from the person who has the legal right to custody without that
person’s consent. International child abduction occurs when a child is:</p>
<ul><li>Taken out of the country in which the child and the person who has the
    legal right to custody normally live (the child is unlawfully removed from
    a country)</li>
  <li>Kept in another country where the child is visiting (the child is
    unlawfully retained in a country)</li>
</ul><p>The abductor may be any person but frequently is one of the child’s
parents.</p>

<p>For example, a child who is in the custody of his mother in Ireland and who
is visited here by his father may be abducted from here and unlawfully removed
by his father. A child who is in the custody of his father in Ireland may go to
visit his mother in the USA and, if she keeps him there beyond the agreed
visiting time, he has been abducted and is unlawfully retained by his mother.
So, an abduction may involve the wrongful removal or the wrongful retention of
a child.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l825cd">Criminal offence </h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0026/index.html">Non-Fatal
Offences against the Person Act 1997</a> deals with the crime of international
child abduction.</p>

<p>Section 16 of the Act applies if you are a parent, guardian or a person to
whom custody of the child has been granted by a court. It does not apply to you
if you are a parent who is not a guardian of the child. It applies if you
unlawfully send or keep a child under the age of 16 out of the State or if you
cause a child to be unlawfully taken, sent or kept. Unlawfully means in
defiance of a court order or without the consent of the other parent or
guardian. </p>

<p>Section 17 applies to people who are not covered by Section 16 and who
unlawfully detain a child or cause a child to be detained. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lb3e6b">Return of the child</h2>

<p>The main concern in international child abduction cases is the return of the
child. The international conventions and the EU Regulation which govern the
return of the child are all based on similar principles. They are that:</p>
<ul><li>The child should be returned to his/her habitual residence as soon as
    possible</li>
  <li>The courts of the jurisdiction in which the child is habitually resident
    are the appropriate courts to decide what is in the best interests of the
    child. So, if there are any disputes about, for example, access, custody,
    maintenance, these disputes should be decided in the country where the
    child is habitually resident.</li>
</ul><p>There is a Central Authority in each country to facilitate the return of
abducted children.</p>

<h3>EU Regulation on international abduction of children</h3>

<p>The EU has a limited role in family law matters. Each individual member
state has its own rules about separation, divorce, maintenance of spouses and
children, custody and guardianship and other family law matters. The role of
the EU is mainly concerned with ensuring that decisions made in one country can
be implemented in another. It also has a role in trying to establish which
country has jurisdiction to hear a particular case. You can find out more about
EU legislation on family law in our document, <a shape="rect" href="../eu_and_family_law.html">EU and family law</a>. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R2201:EN:HTML">Council
Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003</a> on jurisdiction and the recognition and
enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental
responsibility came into effect in March 2005. The Regulation covers the
following aspects of parental responsibility:</p>
<ul><li>Jurisdiction – what country should hear the case, whose laws should
    apply </li>
  <li>Recognition and enforcement – how decisions made in one country are to
    be recognised and enforced in another </li>
  <li>Co-operation between Central Authorities </li>
  <li>Specific rules on child abduction and access rights </li>
</ul><p>The regulation does not set an age limit – that is for the individual
country to decide. In general, the age limit is 18. </p>

<p>It applies only to civil proceedings, not criminal cases. </p>

<p><strong>Jurisdiction<br></strong>The court in the member state of the child’s habitual residence
before the abduction retains jurisdiction to deal with the case except in
certain limited circumstances, for example, where all concerned have acquiesced
in the abduction.</p>

<p><strong>Co-operation between Central Authorities</strong> <br>
The Regulation creates a system of co-operation between Central Authorities of
the member states. These authorities are obliged to facilitate communications
between the courts of the relevant countries and must facilitate agreements
between parents through mediation or other means. </p>

<p><strong>Recognition and enforcement</strong><br>
Judgements given in one member state must be recognised and enforced in another
member state. The court in the other member state may refuse to recognise the
order only on certain grounds.</p>

<p>In the cases of child abduction, it is not necessary to go through the court
procedure for recognition. If you have custody of a child and your child is
abducted to another member state, you may apply to that state for the return of
the child. The court of the member state to which the child has been abducted
can only refuse return of the child in limited circumstances – for example,
if there are not adequate safeguards to ensure that there is no serious risk of
harm to the child should the child return.</p>

<p>In general, the court must order the immediate return of the child. </p>

<p>Under the Hague Convention (see below), the court is not obliged to order
the return if it would expose the child to physical or psychological harm, or
put him/her in an intolerable situation. The EU Regulation requires the return
of the child where that could expose the child to such harm, provided the
authorities in the member state of origin have made or are prepared to make
adequate arrangements to insure the protection of the child after the
return.</p>

<p>The Regulation provides for the right of the child to be heard during the
procedure unless the judge considers it inappropriate due to the child’s age
and degree of maturity. The court cannot refuse to return the child without
first giving the person who requested the return the opportunity to be
heard.</p>

<p>In general, the decision must be made within 6 weeks. </p>

<p>Further information on the EU Regulation is available in the <a shape="rect" href="http://ec.europa.eu/civiljustice/parental_resp/parental_resp_ec_vdm_en.pdf">Practice
Guide for the Application of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2201/2003 (pdf)</a>.
</p>

<h3>International Conventions</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&amp;cid=24">Hague
Convention of 25 October 1980</a> on the civil aspects of international child
abduction (the 1980 Hague Convention) and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&amp;cid=70">Hague
Convention (1996)</a> on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement
and cooperation in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the
protection of children continue to apply in cases where the EU Regulation does
not.</p>

<p>The EU Regulation prevails over the Convention in relation to those aspects
covered by the Regulation. The Convention and the Regulation are generally
similar in scope and in rules.</p>

<p>The European Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions
Concerning Custody of Children and on Restoration of Custody of Children (the
<a shape="rect" href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/105.htm">Luxembourg
Convention</a>) was signed in 1980 and applies to a number of European
countries. It is now of limited relevance because the EU Regulation or the
Hague Convention covers the relevant countries. </p>

<p>Both the Hague and Luxembourg Conventions deal with children under the age
of 16 and provide that the <em>paramountcy</em> principle applies – that
means the welfare of the child is of paramount importance.</p>

<p>The list of <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.authorities&amp;cid=24">countries
which are enforcing the Hague Convention</a> is available on the Hague
Conference on Private International Law website.</p>

<h3>Countries who have not agreed to the conventions </h3>

<p>In the case of countries which are not party to any of the international
Conventions, decisions are made on the basis of private international law. This
means that, in general, the Irish courts recognise court orders made in
jurisdictions with similar legal systems. The courts also take into account the
requirements of the Guardianship of Infants Acts that the child’s welfare and
best interests are assessed. On occasions, the Irish courts have refused to
return a child to a jurisdiction where this might involve a breach of rights
under the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Constitution
of Ireland</a>. </p>

<h3>Irish law on child abduction</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0006/index.html">Child
Abduction and Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1991</a> came into force in
Ireland in October 1991. It brought into Irish law the Hague Convention and the
Luxembourg Convention. </p>

<p>Both Conventions aim to return the child who has been abducted. The Hague
Convention can operate even if there is no court order, if the child is taken
without the consent of one parent. The Luxembourg Convention operates if there
is a court order determining custody and it provides for the mutual recognition
and enforcement of such orders in the countries which are parties to the
Convention.</p>

<p>The countries which are parties to the Conventions agree to be bound by
certain procedures in cases where children are removed from one country to
another: </p>
<ul><li>If a child (aged under 16) is taken to or from a country which is a party
    to the Conventions in defiance of a court order or against the wishes of a
    parent who has been granted custody, the Central Authority in that country
    may help to have the child returned. For Ireland, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/International_child_abduction">Central
    Authority</a> is the Department of Justice and Equality. </li>
  <li>If a child is abducted into a country which is a party to the
    Conventions, the Central Authority will take steps to trace the child, try
    to return the child or get access to the child and if necessary, take court
    proceedings to achieve that. </li>
</ul><p>If a child is abducted into Ireland, the Department of Justice and Equality
may ask the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/legal_aid_and_advice/legal_aid_board.html">Legal Aid Board</a>
to take proceedings in the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/high_court.html">High Court</a>. Legal aid will be
available. Under the Hague Convention, it is possible to negotiate a voluntary
settlement of the issues. </p>

<p>If a child has been abducted from the State, the Central Authority will help
the parent in seeking the return of the child and liaise with other Central
Authorities to that end. </p>

<p>The Act also outlines the circumstances in which a child need not be
returned and the various procedures involved in enforcement. </p>

<p>It also gives power to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/law_enforcement/garda_siochana_national_police_force.html">Gardaí</a>
to detain a child if they suspect that the child is being removed from the
State in breach of any custody order or while proceedings in relation to
custody are in train. </p>

<p>If your child has been internationally abducted, you should contact the
Central Authority in order to set in motion the procedures required in the
country to which the child has been abducted. </p>

<h3>The European Parliament Mediator for International Parental Child
Abduction</h3>

<p>The post of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=154">European
Parliament Mediator for International Parental Child Abduction</a> was created
in 1987. It has no statutory basis. It aims to help children who have been
abducted by one parent in circumstances where the parents are of different
nationality and the marriage has broken down. </p>

<p>Either parent may ask the Mediator to get involved. The Mediator tries to
find a voluntary agreement between the parents. This is done by providing
information and advice and arranging suitable mediators for the particular
case. The Mediator tries to ensure that there is the following combination of
mediators: one woman - one man, one lawyer - one non-lawyer, both speaking both
languages of the parties in the dispute. The Mediator is concerned to ensure
the best interests of the child. </p>

<p>There is no requirement for either parent to co-operate with the Mediator.
If they do co-operate and reach an agreement, that agreement may be turned into
a legally enforceable agreement. This is the case for any agreement reached
after mediation.</p>

<p>If you believe your child is at risk of abduction you should get legal
advice or contact the Gardaí. The Irish Centre for Parentally Abducted
Children (ICPAC) published an <a href="http://www.treoir.ie/cms-assets/documents/15455-417863.icpac-booklet-jan-2011.pdf">ICPAC
Prevention Pack (pdf)</a> which provides information on the steps you should
take if your child is at risk of abduction. This includes advice on gathering
important information relating to your child, which will be required if your
child is abducted, as well as on other steps you can take to reduce the risk.
Reunite International, a UK charity, also provides <a shape="rect" href="http://www.reunite.org/pages/prevention.asp">child abduction prevention

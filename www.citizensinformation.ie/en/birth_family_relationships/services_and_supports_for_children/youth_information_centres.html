<p>Youth Information Centres are centres located around Ireland that provide
free, confidential information for young people and for people who work with
young people. They hold information on subjects like education, employment,
careers, rights and entitlements, sport, leisure, travel and European
opportunities for young people. The network of Youth Information Centres is
funded by the Youth Affairs Unit of the <a href="https://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2Fyouthaffairs%2Fyouth-affairs-omyca.htm&amp;mn=youo4n&amp;nID=1">Department
of Children and Youth Affairs</a>. </p>

<p>Amongst the resources that Youth Information Centres have are newspapers,
guidebooks, leaflets, factsheets, videos, noticeboards and computer databases.
Some centres can provide you with Internet access, a low cost CV preparation
service, European Youth Cards and Hostelling cards. It is possible to have your
particular query dealt with in private by Youth Information Centre staff. </p>

<p>In general, Youth Information Centres do not produce their own leaflets,
except for some localised information. Most of their material comes from other
statutory and voluntary agencies. Youth Information Centre staff co-operate
with statutory and voluntary agencies and may refer you to them if they cannot
satisfy your query. </p>

<h3>Outreach activities</h3>

<p>Youth Information Centres also provide a range of outreach activities aimed
at bringing information to young people through information points,
publications, workshops, seminars, exhibitions, schools and youth club work,
and the local radio and press. </p>

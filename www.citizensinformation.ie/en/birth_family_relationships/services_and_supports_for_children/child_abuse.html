<p>While child abuse has always existed, most children do not experience abuse.
The Government updated <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/Publications/ChildrenFirst.pdf">Children
First, National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children (pdf)</a>
in 2011 [<a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/Child_Welfare_Protection/ChildrenFirstErrata.pdf">added
text 2012 (pdf)</a>]. It emphasises that the welfare of children is of
paramount importance. The Guidelines are intended to help in the identification
and reporting of child abuse. The government is putting Children First on a
legislative basis through the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/36/enacted/en/html">Children
First Act 2015</a> to ensure compliance by all organisations working with
children.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l665bf">What is child abuse?</h2>

<p>Under the Guidelines child abuse is categorised into four different types. A
child may experience more than one form of abuse. </p>

<p>The four types of abuse are: </p>
<ul><li>Neglect </li>
  <li>Emotional abuse </li>
  <li>Physical abuse </li>
  <li>Sexual abuse </li>
</ul><h3>Neglect </h3>

<p>Neglect occurs where a child suffers significant harm by being deprived of
such things as food, clothes, hygiene, medical care, intellectual stimulation
and supervision. The neglect generally becomes apparent in different ways over
time rather than at a specific point. Significant harm occurs where the
child’s needs are neglected to such an extent that his/her wellbeing and/or
development are severely affected. </p>

<h3>Emotional abuse </h3>

<p>Emotional abuse occurs where a child’s need for affection, approval and
security is not being met by the child’s parents or carer. Examples of this
are unreasonable disciplinary measures, premature imposition of responsibility
and exposure to domestic violence. The effects of emotional abuse on a child
are shown through the child’s behaviour, emotional state or development.</p>

<h3>Physical abuse</h3>

<p>Physical abuse occurs where a child is deliberately injured or is injured
due to the deliberate failure of the child’s carer to protect the child.
Examples of physical abuse are shaking a child, use of excessive force or
allowing a substantial risk of injury to a child. </p>

<h3>Sexual abuse </h3>

<p>Sexual abuse occurs where a child is used by someone for their own or
someone else’s gratification or sexual arousal.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l3f8af">How do you recognise child abuse?</h2>

<p>Child abuse is not always readily visible and your ability to recognise it
can depend as much on your willingness to accept the possibility of its
existence as on your knowledge of child abuse. There are usually three stages
in recognising the abuse:</p>
<ul><li>Considering the possibility of its existence, such as, where a child has
    a suspicious injury or appears distressed for no obvious reason. </li>
  <li>Observing signs of abuse, for example, where a child makes a direct or
    indirect disclosure. A pattern of signs is the most reliable indicator of
    abuse. </li>
  <li>Recording of observations and any other relevant information in order to
    establish the grounds for concern. </li>
</ul><p>Before you act on your concerns you need to consider whether any alternative
explanation might exist. </p>

<p>The Child and Family Agency, also known as Tusla, provides <a shape="rect" href="http://www.tusla.ie/services/child-protection-welfare/definitions-of-child-abuse">information
on the types of child abuse</a> on its website.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l4b602">How do I report my concerns?</h2>

<p>Anyone who suspects that a child is being abused, or is at risk of abuse,
has a duty to report their suspicions to Tusla. You should report your concerns
to the <a href="http://www.tusla.ie/services/child-protection-welfare/contact-a-social-worker">Tusla
Children and Family Services local social work duty service</a> in the area the
child lives. </p>

<p>You can report your concerns in person, by writing or by phone. While you
can report your concerns anonymously, Tusla does not normally reveal the names
of people who report suspicions of child abuse unless they have permission to
do so. If you are unsure about your concerns, you can discuss your suspicions
with the social worker before deciding to make a formal report. </p>

<p>Tusla will consider your report and decide whether it needs following up. If
it does, Tusla will look for information from other sources and will contact
the child and the child’s parents in order to establish what is going on. It
will then take whatever action is required to protect the child. </p>

<p>If you need to report your concerns outside normal office hours (weekends
and at night) you should report your concerns to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/law_enforcement/garda_siochana_national_police_force.html">Garda
Síochána</a>. </p>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0049/index.html">Protections
for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998</a>, so long as you report what you
believe to be true and you do it in good faith you cannot be sued for making a
false or malicious report.</p>

<h3>Are parents informed if concerns are reported?</h3>

<p>If you are the parent of a child being assessed following the reporting of
concerns, you should be told why and you should be afforded the opportunity to
respond. Concerns about your child should be explained to you.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tusla.ie/children-first/how-do-i-report-abuse/what-are-the-parents-rights">Information
on a parent's rights</a> is available on the Tusla website and in their leaflet
on <a href="http://www.tusla.ie/uploads/content/Leaflet_for_parents-child_protection_concerns.pdf">social
work assessment of child protection and welfare concerns (pdf)</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l9740f">Duties of organisations</h2>

<p>Every organisation that provides services to children should have somebody
who is responsible for dealing with suspected or actual child abuse and to whom
concerns can be reported. Information in relation to schools is available in
our document on <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/attendance_and_discipline_in_schools/child_abuse.html">reporting
child abuse at primary and post primary level</a>. </p>

on what organisations need to do</a> on the Tusla website.</p>

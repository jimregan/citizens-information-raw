<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The primary legislation regulating child care policy is the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0017/index.html">Child
Care Act 1991</a> which brought in considerable changes in relation to children
in care. Until the main part of the Act was implemented in 1995, child care
policy had been regulated by the 1908 Children Act.</p>

<h3>Duty of the Child and Family Agency</h3>

<p>Under the Child Care Act 1991 Act, as amended by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/act/pub/0040/index.html">Child and
Family Agency Act 2013</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../family_support_agency.html">Tusla - the Child and Family Agency</a>
has a statutory duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving
adequate care and protection. The definition of a child is a person under 18
years of age who is not or has not been married.</p>

<p>When carrying out its statutory duty, Tusla must have regard to the
following:</p>
<ul><li>It is generally in the best interests of the child to be brought up in
    his/her own family </li>
  <li>Having regard to the rights and duties of the parents, the welfare of the
    child is the first and paramount consideration and, as far as is
    practicable, the wishes of the child should be considered </li>
</ul><p>Among other things, Tusla is required to:</p>
<ul><li>Identify children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and
    co-ordinate information on children from all relevant sources </li>
  <li>Provide child care and family support services with the aim of helping
    parents to care for their children and to avoid the need for such children
    to be taken into care </li>
  <li>Prepare an annual report on the adequacy of the child care and family
    support services </li>
</ul><h3>Child Care Law Reporting Project</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.childlawproject.ie/">Child Care Law Reporting
Project</a> was launched in 2013. It was established to provide information to
the public on child care proceedings in the courts; to conduct research; to
recommend how to deal with issues in the child care system identified by the
research; and to promote confidence in the child care system.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l84f4e">Voluntary care</h2>

<p>If a child is in need of care and protection and is unlikely to receive it
at home, then Tusla must take them into care. This may happen, for example, in
the case of an orphan or an abandoned child.</p>

<p>In other cases where parents are unable to cope due to illness or other
problems, they may agree to their children being taken into the care of Tusla.
This is known as voluntary care. In these cases, while Tusla has care of the
children it must consider the parents' wishes as to how the care is provided.
Tusla is obliged to maintain these children for as long as their welfare
requires it. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lc7d44">Care orders</h2>

<p>There are a number of procedures which Tusla can use when dealing with
children who are at risk or who are in need of care. Tusla may apply to the
courts for a number of different orders. These orders give the courts a range
of powers (including decision-making), about the type of care necessary and
about access to the children for parents and other relatives. The following is
a sumary of these orders:</p>
<ul><li>Emergency care order - maximum of 8 days in care </li>
  <li>Interim care order - maximum of 29 days in care but may be extended </li>
  <li>Care order - can continue up to age 18 </li>
  <li>Supervision order - maximum of 12 months but may be renewed </li>
  <li>Interim special care order - maximum of 28 days but may be extended </li>
  <li>Special care order - maximum of 6 months but may be extended. </li>
</ul><p>In general, the various orders involve the child being taken into care by
Tusla. A supervision order however, involves the child being visited and
monitored in their own home by Tusla. See "Further information" below for more
detail on the various tyes of order.</p>

<h3>Separate representation for the child </h3>

<p>The court must make all decisions on the basis that the welfare of the child
is paramount. With this consideration in mind, the court may order that the
child be joined as a party to the care proceedings. This means that the child
has separate legal representation, paid for by Tusla. If the child is not a
party to the proceedings, the court may appoint a <em>guardian ad litem</em> to
speak for the child. (A guardian ad litem is an independent person appointed by
the court to represent the wishes and interests of a child in specified court
proceedings.)</p>

<h2>Family welfare conferences</h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Children
Act 2001</a> provided for family welfare conferences for children at risk from
their own behaviour and these provisions came into effect in July 2004. The
family welfare conference is a mechanism for early intervention and the
conference may be convened where:</p>
<ul><li>Tusla is directed to convene it by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.courts.ie/courts.ie/library3.nsf/pagecurrent/9FEE308102F3B50A80257FBC004C0472?opendocument&amp;l=en">Children
    Court</a> or </li>
  <li>Tusla is of the view that a child requires special care or protection
    which he/she is unlikely to receive unless a special care order is made
  </li>
</ul><p>The function of a family welfare conference is to decide whether the child
is in need of special care or protection and, if so, to recommend to Tusla that
it apply for a special care order. If not, the conference may make appropriate
recommendations to Tusla, including, if necessary, a recommendation that Tusla
apply for a care order or a supervision order. The conference decisions must be
unanimous and, if it is not possible to get agreement, Tusla must make the
decision.</p>

<p>The conference may be attended by the child; the parents or guardians; any
guardian ad litem; other relatives agreed by the co-ordinator after consulting
the child and the parents; Tusla officials; and any other person who could make
a positive contribution because of knowledge of the child or the family or
because of particular expertise. <br>
When Tusla receives the conference recommendation, it may:</p>
<ul><li>Apply for a special care order or </li>
  <li>Apply for a supervision order or a care order or </li>
  <li>Provide any appropriate help or service for the child or his/her family
  </li>
</ul><p>Family welfare conferences have legal privilege - this means that any
information, statement or admission disclosed at such a conference will not be
admissible in evidence in court.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l8c1d8">Children in Tusla care </h2>

<p>When a child is in the care of Tusla, there are a number of different ways
in which care can be provided. Whatever kind of care is chosen, Tusla must
facilitate reasonable access for the parents or other relatives of the children
in its care.</p>

<h3>Foster care</h3>

<p>Where possible <a shape="rect" href="../adoption_and_fostering/fostering.html">Tusla places the child with
foster parents</a>. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/si/0260.html">Child Care
(Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations 1995</a> require that a care
plan for the child be drawn up which sets out, among other things, the support
to be provided to the child and the foster parents and the arrangements for
access to the child in foster care by parents or relatives. If there is a
shortage of foster parents, children may be placed in residential care
instead.</p>

<h3>Residential care</h3>

<p>Residential care can be in a home run by Tusla, a children's residential
centre registered under the 1991 Act, a school or other suitable place of
residence. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/si/0259.html">Child Care
(Placement of Children in Residential Care) Regulations 1995</a> state the
requirements for the placing of children in residential care and the standards
for residential centres which are registered with Tusla. The centres are
subject to inspection by the <a shape="rect" href="https://www.hiqa.ie/">Health
Information and Quality Authority</a>.</p>

<h3>Special Care Units </h3>

<p>Children taken into care under special care orders or interim special care
orders are place in special care units. Tusla may provide and maintain special
care units or make arrangements with voluntary bodies to provide and operate
them. All centres are subject to the approval of the Minister for Children and
Youth Affairs. The Minister makes regulations dealing with the detailed
operation of such centres. Children who are convicted of an offence may not be
placed in special care units.</p>

<h3>Placing children with relatives</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/si/0261.html">Child Care
(Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations 1995</a> make provision for
relatives to receive an allowance for caring for a child placed with them by
Tusla. The regulations set out the arrangements for the placement and are
broadly similar to the Foster Care Regulations.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l53210">Young people leaving care</h2>

<p>Currently, Tusla can provide further assistance to young people up to the
age of 21 who have been in care. This assistance may include arranging
accommodation or contributing towards maintenance while the young person
continues at school or college. It can be extended until the young person
reaches 23 years of age, to facilitate the completion of an education
course.</p>

<p>It is intended that from 1 September 2017, <a href="https://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=4213">young people leaving care
will have the right to an aftercare plan</a> prepared by Tusla. This plan will
identify the transitional supports that the young person requires, such as
education, training, financial support and social network support. The
aftercare plan must be provided before the young person leaves care.</p>

<p>Focus Ireland has published <a href="https://www.focusireland.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pathwaysfinal.pdf">Pathways
(pdf)</a>, an aftercare guide for young people who are preparing to leave
care.</p>

<h2>Care procedures</h2>

<p>Under the 1991 Act there are a number of procedures which Tusla can use when
dealing with children who are at risk or who are in need of care. Tusla may
apply to the courts for a number of different orders which give the courts a
range of powers including decisions about the kind of care, and the access to
the children for parents and other relatives:</p>
<ul><li>Emergency care orders </li>
  <li>Care orders </li>
  <li>Supervision orders </li>
</ul><p>These orders replaced the previous fit person orders and place of safety
orders. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Children
Act 2001</a> amended the Child Care Act 1991 to allow for another sort of order
- a special care order. This is for situations where the child is at risk from
his/her own behaviour.</p>

<h3>Emergency care orders</h3>

<p>If the gardaí have reason to believe that there is an immediate and serious
risk to the health or welfare of a child which cannot wait until an emergency
care order is made, they have the power to enter the home and remove a child,
by force if necessary, to safety. The child must be given into the care of
Tusla as soon as possible. Tusla may either return the child to the
parents/guardians or may apply to the District Court for an emergency care
order. If the court is not due to sit within 3 days a special sitting must be
arranged.</p>

<p>Tusla can apply for an emergency care order for a child who is still at home
or for one who has been removed by the gardaí. This may be made without notice
being given to the parents or guardians of the child. The order will be made if
the judge considers that there is an immediate and serious risk to the health
or welfare of the child requiring him/her to be placed, or to remain in, the
care of Tusla. The child must remain in the care of Tusla for 8 days or a
shorter period if specified in the order.</p>

<h3>Care orders</h3>

<p>Tusla must apply for a care order or a supervision order (see below) if a
child needs care and protection which he/she is unlikely to receive without an
order. The District Court judge may make an interim care order while the
decision on a full care order is pending. This means that the child is placed
in the care of Tusla for 29 days. It may be extended if Tusla and the parents
agree. Generally the parents/guardians must be given notice of an interim care
order application.</p>

<p>A care order may be made when the court is satisfied that:</p>
<ul><li>The child has been or is being assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or
    sexually abused or that the child's health, development or welfare has been
    or is likely to be impaired or neglected </li>
  <li>The child needs care and protection which he/she is unlikely to receive
    without a care order </li>
</ul><p>When a care order is made the child remains in the care of Tusla for the
length of time specified by the order or until the age of 18 when he/she is no
longer a child. Tusla has the rights and duties of a parent during this
time.</p>

<h3>Supervision orders</h3>

<p>A supervision order is an alternative to children being taken into the care
of Tusla.</p>

<p>During the application for a care order the court may decide that a care
order is not necessary or appropriate, but that the child should be visited
regularly by Tusla, and a supervision order may be made. It may be made instead
of a care order or while waiting for a decision on a care order. Alternatively
Tusla may apply to the court for a supervision order instead of a care order.
</p>

<p>A supervision order gives Tusla the authority to visit and monitor the
health and welfare of the child and to give the parents any necessary advice.
The order is for up to a maximum of 12 months but may be renewed.</p>

<h3>Special care orders</h3>

<p>Tusla must apply for a special care order or an interim special care order
where a child needs special care and protection and is unlikely to get it
unless such an order is made. Tusla must convene a family welfare conference
before applying for the order.</p>

<p>The court may make a special care order if it is satisfied that:</p>
<ul><li>The child's behaviour poses a real and substantial risk to his/her
    health, safety, development or welfare and </li>
  <li>The child needs special care and protection which he/she is unlikely to
    get without such an order </li>
</ul><p>A special care order means that the child is committed to Tusla's care for
as long as it remains in force. It authorises Tusla to provide appropriate
care, education and treatment and, for that purpose, to detain the child in a
special care unit. The order will initially be for a period between 3 and 6
months and may be extended.</p>

<p>Special care orders may be varied by the court on its own initiative or by
request of Tusla. The court may make a supervision or care order in respect of
the child if appropriate.</p>

<p>Interim special care orders may be made before the normal procedure for a
special care order is complete. Such orders will mean that the child may be
detained in a special care unit for up to 28 days.</p>

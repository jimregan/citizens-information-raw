<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Since January 1995, parents of a stillborn child in Ireland have been able
to register their child's birth, even if he/she was born before that date.</p>

<p>If you wish to register the stillbirth, you should go and sign the
Stillbirths Register at the office of the Registrar of Births, Marriages and
Deaths in any district. (Before the relevant provisions of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0003/sec0028.html#sec28">Civil
Registration Act 2004</a> came into effect on 5 December 2005, a stillbirth
could only be registered in the Registrar's District in which it took place.)
You must provide written evidence of the stillbirth.</p>

<p>The registrar will give you a certificate of stillbirth at the time of
signing. If you would like a certificate at a later date, you should contact
the <a href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/General-Register-Office.aspx">General
Register Office</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>All stillbirths occurring in Ireland since 1 January 1995 must be
registered, if the baby weighs at least 500 grammes or has a gestational age of
at least 24 weeks.</p>

<p>You (the parents) can choose to register the stillbirth yourselves, but if
you are unable to do so, you may ask a relative of either parent to act as
<span>qualified informant</span> to register it on your behalf. If a stillbirth
is not registered within 12 months, the hospital, midwife or medical
practitioner who attended the birth may be asked to register it.</p>

<p>If you do wish to register the stillbirth yourselves, the medical
practitioner who attended the birth or examined the baby must give you a signed
medical certificate stating the baby's weight and gestational age, and the name
and address of the hospital or other institution where the stillbirth took
place.</p>

<p>If you wish to register a stillbirth that happened before 1 January 1995,
you can do so at any time. You will need specific evidence to prove that a
stillbirth occurred. This evidence could be an authoritative written statement
from your hospital, nursing home, medical practitioner or midwife, but the
registrar may accept other forms of evidence.</p>

<p>Again, the stillbirth can only be registered if the baby weighed at least
500 grammes or had a gestational age of at least 24 weeks.</p>

<p>If your baby was stillborn in hospital, the hospital staff will usually help
you to complete a Birth Notification Form (Form BNF/01). In the case of a home
birth, the midwife or doctor will do this. The form outlines the information to
be recorded in the Register of Stillbirths. This form will be forwarded to a
registration office to inform the registrar that the stillbirth has occurred.
The registration process will only be complete when the parent(s) or other
qualified informant attends the registrar's office in person and signs the
Stillbirths Register.</p>

<p><span>The following information is recorded in the Register of
Stillbirths:</span></p>
<ul><li>Time, date and place of birth of the child </li>
  <li>The child's gender </li>
  <li>The child's weight and gestational age </li>
  <li>The child's Personal Public Service number (PPSN) (this will be allocated
    at registration) </li>
  <li>The child's forename(s) and surname </li>
  <li>The mother's forename(s) and surname </li>
  <li>The mother's birth surname </li>
  <li>Birth surname of the mother's mother </li>
  <li>All previously used surnames of the mother (if any) </li>
  <li>The mother's normal occupation </li>
  <li>The mother's normal address at the date of birth </li>
  <li>The mother's date of birth </li>
  <li>The mother's marital status </li>
  <li>The mother's Personal Public Service number (PPSN) </li>
  <li>Similar information is entered for the father. </li>
</ul></div>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>In 2008 the High Court ruled that Ireland was in breach of the European
Convention on Human Rights in not having a process to legally recognise the
acquired gender of transsexual or transgender people. A Gender Recognition
Advisory Group was set up to advise on the legislation required to provide for
legal recognition of the changed gender of transgender people who have made the
transition from one gender to another. The <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/Report-of-the-Gender-Recognition-Advisory-Group.pdf">Advisory
Group’s report</a> was produced in 2011.</p>

<p>On 4 September 2015 the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/25/enacted/en/html">Gender
Recognition Act 2015</a> came into effect and provides for the legal
recognition of a person’s preferred gender. The effect of the legal
recognition is not retrospective. All rights, responsibilities and consequences
of actions by you prior to the date of recognition of your preferred gender
remain unaffected.</p>

<p>Under the legislation there are 3 parts to the process of obtaining a new
birth certificate which reflects your preferred gender.</p>
<ol><li>Apply for a <strong>gender recognition certificate</strong> which you can
    use as proof of gender or identity</li>
  <li>Apply to be registered in a <strong>register of gender
    recognition</strong></li>
  <li>Apply for a <strong>certified copy of your entry</strong> in the register
    of gender recognition which will satisfy any requirement where you are
    asked to provide a birth certificate</li>
</ol></div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l4f418">Gender recognition certificate</h2>

<p>You can apply for a gender recognition certificate if you are at least 18
years of age and you are:</p>
<ul><li>Registered in the register of births or</li>
  <li>Registered in the adopted children register or</li>
  <li>Registered in the register of intercountry adoptions or</li>
  <li>Recorded in a foreign births entry book or in the foreign births
  register</li>
</ul><p>Those born outside the State but ordinarily resident in the State can also
apply. Evidence of their birth is required.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>An application can be made on behalf of a child aged 16 years or over if a
court order is obtained that exempts the child from meeting the age
requirement.</p>

<h3>Name</h3>

<p>You can have the gender recognition certificate issued in a different name
to that on your birth certificate. You have to provide:</p>
<ul><li>Proof of use of the name for over two years or</li>
  <li>A <a href="problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/changing_your_name_by_deed_poll.html">deed
    poll for a change of name</a> that has been enrolled in the Central Office
    of the High Court</li>
</ul><h3>Foreign gender recognition</h3>

<p>If you have changed gender under the law of another state, you can apply for
a gender recognition certificate. You will have to provide a copy of the
relevant decision, order or certificate.</p>

<h3>Statutory Declaration</h3>

<p>When applying you have to sign a statutory declaration which is part of the
application form. It must be signed in the presence of a <a href="../justice/civil_law/peace_commissioners.html">peace commissioner</a>,
a <a href="../justice/civil_law/notaries_public.html">notary public</a>, a
<a href="../justice/civil_law/commissioners_for_oaths.html">commissioner for
oaths</a> or a <a href="../justice/courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a>.</p>

<h3>Making an application</h3>

<p>There is no charge for a gender recognition certificate. You apply using <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/GRC1.pdf">application form GRC 1 (pdf)</a>.
You must complete the form, including the statutory declaration, and send the

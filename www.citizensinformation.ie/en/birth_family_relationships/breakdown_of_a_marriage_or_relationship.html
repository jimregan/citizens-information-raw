<p>The breakdown of a marriage or other relationship is a difficult and
traumatic process. There are many different issues to be addressed such as
financial support, the family home and parenting of children. Trying to sort
out these issues can be very stressful. If the relationship has become abusive,
you may need to get a safety or barring order.</p>

<h3>Marital relationships</h3>

<p>If you are married, there are a number of <a shape="rect" href="separation_and_divorce/legal_options_following_marital_breakdown.html">legal
options following a marital breakdown</a>. The options available are:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="separation_and_divorce/separation_agreement.html">Separation
    agreements</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="separation_and_divorce/judicial_separation.html">Judicial separation
    </a></li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="separation_and_divorce/divorce_decrees.html">Divorce</a> </li>
</ul><p>A court can also grant a <a shape="rect" href="civil_annulment/nullity_of_marriage.html">nullity decree</a> which is a
declaration that a valid marriage never existed.</p>

<h4><strong>Financial matters</strong><br></h4>

<p>In a marriage, there is a legal responsibility on both spouses to maintain
each other and any children in accordance with their means. This means that any
settlement agreed or imposed by the court should include a <a shape="rect" href="separation_and_divorce/maintenance_orders_and_agreements.html">maintenance
agreement</a>. The issue of what happens to the <a shape="rect" href="separation_and_divorce/family_home.html">family home</a> also arises.</p>

<p>Separation or divorce may have tax implications. It is important to
understand the <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/sep_divorce_income_tax.html">different
taxation options available</a> and <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/maintenance_and_tax.html">how
maintenance payments affect taxation</a>. You may need to get specialist tax
advice before entering into arrangements that have <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/capital_taxes/capital_taxes_following_separation_or_divorce.html">capital
gains tax implications</a>.</p>

<h4>Children<br></h4>

<p><strong></strong>Married parents are automatically joint guardians of their
children. Separation or divorce does not change this. However, separation and
divorce do have implications for <a shape="rect" href="separation_and_divorce/separation_and_divorce_children.html">custody and
access to children</a>.</p>

<h3>Civil Partnerships</h3>

<p>The <a href="separation_and_divorce/legal_options_following_civil_partnership_breakdown.html">options
available to those in civil partnerships</a> where there is a breakdown in the
relationship are similar to those available to married couples. The courts are
able to grant a <a href="civil_annulment/nullity_of_civil_partnership.html">decree of nullity
of civil partnership</a> in broadly the same way as decrees of nullity of
marriage are granted. The courts are also able to <a href="separation_and_divorce/dissolution_decrees.html">dissolve civil
partnerships</a> in a similar way to the granting of divorce, but the rules
governing the dissolution of civil partnerships are different.</p>

<h3>Cohabiting relationships</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="unmarried_couples/rights_of_unmarried_couples.html">rights of cohabiting
couples</a> are in general not recognised in Irish law. If the relationship
breaks down, this has important implications for such things as <a href="problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/property_rights_and_the_breakdown_of_a_cohabiting_relationship.html">property
ownership</a>. There is a <a href="problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/redress_scheme_for_cohabiting_couples.html">redress
scheme for cohabiting couples</a> who have been in a long-term relationship or
who have had children.</p>

<h4>Children<br></h4>

<p><strong></strong>Where there are children, issues of <a shape="rect" href="unmarried_couples/custody_of_children_and_unmarried_couples.html">custody</a>,
<a shape="rect" href="unmarried_couples/legal_guardianship_and_unmarried_couples.html">guardianship</a>
and <a shape="rect" href="unmarried_couples/access_to_children_and_unmarried_couples.html">access
to the children</a> are likely to arise. Also, while unmarried parents do not
have a financial responsibility to maintain each other, both parents are
responsible for the <a shape="rect" href="parenting_alone/maintenance_and_unmarried_couples.html">maintenance of
their children</a>. </p>

<h3>Parenting alone</h3>

<p>A separation, divorce or breakdown of a non-marital relationship can result
in a one-parent family. There are a range of benefits and entitlements
available to lone parents as well as organisations offering support. For
example, <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent
Family Payment</a> is a payment for men and women who are bringing children up
without the support of a partner. Further information is available in our
document: <a shape="rect" href="parenting_alone/parenting_alone.html">Parenting
alone</a> </p>

<h3>Abuse and violence</h3>

<p>If the relationship is abusive or violent, a <a shape="rect" href="problems_in_marriages_and_relationships/barring_safety_and_protection_orders.html">barring,
safety or protection order</a> may be required. Information on domestic and
sexual violence as well as information on local and national support services
is available from <a shape="rect" href="http://www.cosc.ie/">Cosc - The
National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based
Violence</a>. </p>

<p>If you are concerned about violence in your home, you should contact your
local Garda Station. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.garda.ie/Stations/Default.aspx">Contact details for your local
Garda station</a> are available on the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/law_enforcement/garda_siochana_national_police_force.html">Garda
Síochána</a> website. You could also visit <a shape="rect" href="../health/gp_and_hospital_services/">your family doctor</a> who, apart
from dealing with any possible injuries, can provide information on counselling
and other supports.</p>

<p>To apply for a barring order or a safety order you must go to your local
District Court Office. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.courts.ie/offices.nsf/WebCObyJurisdiction?OpenView&amp;Start=1&amp;Count=30&amp;Expand=4#4">Contact
details for your local District Court office</a> are available from the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.courts.ie/">Courts Service</a>. </p>

<h3>Child abduction</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="services_and_supports_for_children/international_child_abduction.html">International
child abduction</a> occurs when a child is unlawfully removed from a country or
unlawfully retained in a country. The Irish Centre for Parentally Abducted
Children (ICPAC) publishes an ICPAC Prevention Pack which provides information
on the steps you should take if your child is at risk of abduction. Reunite
International, a UK charity, also provides <a shape="rect" href="http://www.reunite.org/pages/prevention.asp">child abduction prevention
guides</a> on its website.</p>

<h3>Legal and other supports</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="separation_and_divorce/family_mediation_service.html">Family Mediation
Service</a> provides a free service that helps separating couples co-operate
with each other in working out mutually acceptable arrangements. The Child and
Family Agency funds <a shape="rect" href="http://www.tusla.ie/services/family-community-support/counselling/">voluntary
organisations that provide marriage and relationship counselling</a>. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.themii.ie/">Mediators Institute of
Ireland</a> can provide a list of private accredited mediators.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/legal_aid_and_advice/civil_legal_advice_and_legal_aid.html">Legal
aid and advice</a> is available from the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/legal_aid_and_advice/legal_aid_board.html">Legal Aid Board</a>

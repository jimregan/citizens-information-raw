<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are a guardian of a child in Ireland, you have a duty to maintain and
properly care for the child and you have a right to make decisions about the
child's religious and secular education, health requirements and general
welfare. </p>

<p>Married parents of a child are <em>joint guardians</em> and have equal
rights in relation to the child. The rights of parents to guardianship are set
down in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1964/en/act/pub/0007/sec0006.html#zza7y1964s6">Section
6 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964</a>.</p>

<p>For children born outside of marriage, only the mother has automatic rights
to guardianship. (Even though a father's name may be registered on the child's
birth certificate, this does not give him any guardianship rights in respect of
his child).</p>

<p>On 18 January 2016 certain provisions of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2015/en/act/pub/0009/index.html">Children
and Family Relationships Act 2015</a> came into effect that made a number of <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR16000018">changes to the
Guardianship of Infants Act 1964</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Automatic guardianship</h3>

<p>If a child is born outside of marriage, the mother is the sole guardian. The
position of the unmarried father of the child is not so certain. An unmarried
father will automatically be a guardian if he has lived with the child's mother
for 12 consecutive months after 18 January 2016, including at least 3 months
with the mother and child following the child's birth.</p>

<h3>Guardianship by agreement</h3>

<p>If the mother agrees, the father can become a joint guardian if both parents
sign a <em>statutory declaration</em>. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/si/0005.html">statutory
declaration (SI 5 of 1998)</a> must be signed in the presence of a <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/civil_law/peace_commissioners.html">Peace
Commissioner</a> or a <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/civil_law/commissioners_for_oaths.html">Commissioner for
Oaths</a>. A <a href="http://www.treoir.ie/cms-assets/documents/11563-809564.sino5of1998.pdf">copy
of the statutory declaration (pdf)</a> is available from the National
Information Service of Treoir (see below) or on its website.</p>

<p>This declaration states the names of the parents of the child, that they are
unmarried and that they agree that the father should be appointed as a
joint-guardian. The declaration also states that the parents have agreed
arrangements regarding custody of and access to the child. If there is more
than one child, a separate statutory declaration should be made for each.</p>

<h3>Guardianship through the courts</h3>

<h4>Unmarried fathers</h4>

<p>If the mother does not agree to sign the statutory declaration or agree that
the father be appointed as joint guardian, the father must apply to the court
to be appointed as a joint-guardian. You do not require legal representation to
do this, you can make the application on your own behalf. Apply directly to the
<a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/district_court.html">District
Court</a> and contact the clerk of the court to institute proceedings. (This is
possible, irrespective of whether your name is on the child's birth certificate
or not). </p>

<p>While the mother's views are taken into account, the fact that she does not
consent to the guardianship application does not automatically mean that the
court will refuse the order sought by the father. Instead, the court will
decide what is in the best interest of the child. </p>

<p>In situations where the father has been appointed joint guardian of a child,
then his consent is required for certain things relating to the child's general
welfare and other items. (For example, for passport applications for the child
and to take the child out of the country). Read more about <a shape="rect" href="http://www.treoir.ie/cms-assets/documents/updated%20leaflets%2028th%20feb/16547-829422.passport-applications-for-children.pdf">passports
for children of unmarried parents here</a> (pdf). The father's consent is also
required for the adoption of the child by another couple (or by the mother and
her husband). Read more about <a shape="rect" href="../adoption_and_fostering/adopting_a_child.html">adoption here</a>. </p>

<h4>Other people</h4>

<p>As well as fathers, certain other people may apply to the court for
guardianship:</p>
<ul><li>A step-parent, a civil partner or a person who has cohabited with a
    parent for not less than 3 years may apply to the court to become a
    guardian where they have co-parented the child for more than 2 years.</li>
  <li>A person who has provided for the child’s day-to-day care for a
    continuous period of more than a year may apply for guardianship if the
    child has no parent or guardian who is willing or able to exercise the
    rights and responsibilities of guardianship.</li>
</ul><p>Also a parent can nominate a temporary guardian who can be appointed by the
court if the parent is suffering from a serious illness or injury which
prevents them from exercising their guardianship responsibilities in respect of
their child.</p>

<p>If the court appoints a guardian to a child where one or both parents are
alive, the guardian will not generally have the right to make certain major
decisions about the child unless that right is expressly granted by the
court.</p>

<h3>Removal of guardianship rights</h3>

<p>Fathers and others who have been appointed joint guardians by a court or by
statutory declaration can be removed from their position if the court is
satisfied it is in the child's best interest. The only way a mother can give up
her guardianship rights in Ireland, is if the child is placed for adoption. </p>

<h3>Marriage after the child is born</h3>

<p>If the parents of a child marry each other after the birth, then the father
automatically becomes a joint guardian of the child (provided that the father's
name is on the <a href="../after_your_baby_is_born/registering_birth_your_baby.html">birth
certificate</a>). There is, therefore, no need to apply for guardianship rights
nor is there any need for the father to adopt the child. </p>

<p>Where the father is joint guardian and the mother subsequently marries
another man or enters into a civil partnership, the father will remain the
joint guardian of his child. If the mother and her husband wish to adopt the
child, they must seek consent from the child's father. If the child's father
consents to the adoption, then he gives up his right to guardianship of his
child.</p>

<h3>Same-sex couples</h3>

<p>The issue of guardianship may arise if one of you has a child. You may have
guardianship rights in relation to your child and you may wish your same-sex
partner to also have guardianship rights. As mentioned above, it is possible
for your partner to apply to become a guardian of the child.</p>

<p>It is not possible for you and your same-sex partner to jointly adopt a
child, even if one of you is the birth parent of the child. While the Children
and Family Relationships Act 2015 provides for cohabiting couples, including
same-sex couples, to adopt a child, the provisions are not yet in effect. </p>

<h3>Guardians and wills</h3>

<p>It's very important if you are the guardian of a child (especially if you
are a mother and sole guardian) that you make a will, appointing a guardian to
act on your behalf in the event of your death. It's strongly advised that you
talk this over with someone who could act as guardian and that he/she gives
his/her consent to being named in your will as testamentary guardian. </p>

<p>The child's surviving guardian (if there is one) will then act jointly with
the new guardian. Read more about <a shape="rect" href="/en/death/before_a_death/making_a_will.html">making a will and what you need
to know here</a>. </p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>You do not require legal representation in order to apply for guardianship
of your child. Staff in your local district court will provide you with
assistance to help guide you through the process. </p>

<p>If you go to a family law <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a>, you will have to pay
solicitors' fees. You should be aware that solicitors' fees in Ireland are not
fixed and can vary considerably. Shop around and obtain some quotes before you
decide on a legal firm. Be aware however, that your solicitor must explain all
of the costs to you in advance. </p>

<p>If you are <a href="../../justice/legal_aid_and_advice/legal_aid_intro.html">eligible for
legal aid</a>, you must pay a contribution towards costs. </p>

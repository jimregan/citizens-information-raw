<p>Succession relates to the inheritance of a person's property on their death.
It is governed by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1965_0027.htm">Succession
Act 1965</a>. The Act gives the surviving spouse/civil partner an automatic
right to a share in the estate of their deceased spouse/civil partner. The
share to which the spouse/civil partner is entitled is often called “a legal
right share”. </p>

<p>The surviving spouse/civil partner is legally entitled to the appropriate
share regardless of the actual terms of the will. The fact that the parties may
have lived apart for many years does not of itself affect their entitlements
under the Act.</p>

<p>Succession rights can be renounced voluntarily by either or both
spouses/civil partners in a separation agreement. In granting a decree of
judicial separation, a court can extinguish a spouse's succession rights if it
is satisfied that adequate provision exists for the spouse whose rights are
being extinguished.</p>

<p>Once a decree of divorce/dissolution is granted, the parties are no longer
married or in a civil partnership, and succession rights are automatically
extinguished.</p>

<p>A divorced spouse or a civil partner whose civil partnership has been
dissolved can make an application to court seeking a share of the estate of
their former spouse/civil partner, provided that the application is made within
six months of the date of the Grant of Probate or Administration and the
divorced spouse/civil partner has not remarried or entered into a new civil
partnership.</p>

<p>A decree of divorce allows both parties to a marriage to remarry. If a court
is satisfied that the required conditions (see 'Rules' below) are met, the
court will grant the decree of divorce dissolving the marriage. When it grants
the decree of divorce, the court may also make orders in relation to <a shape="rect" href="separation_and_divorce_children.html">custody of children
and access to them</a> , the payment of <a shape="rect" href="maintenance_orders_and_agreements.html">maintenance</a> and lump sums,
the transfer of property, the extinguishment of succession rights, <a shape="rect" href="sep_divorce_pensions.html">pension</a> rights and other
matters. </p>

<p>As separating couples must have been living separate lives for a number of
years before an application for a divorce is made, many obtain a <a shape="rect" href="separation_agreement.html">separation agreement</a> or a <a shape="rect" href="judicial_separation.html">judicial separation</a> to
regulate matters between them before they seek a divorce. </p>

<p>In any application for a decree of divorce, the court can review any
previous arrangements made by the parties, such as a separation agreement,
particularly if the circumstances of either party have changed. </p>

<p>When a decree of divorce is granted, it cannot be reversed. Either party can
apply to court to have any orders made under the decree - such as maintenance -
reviewed by the court. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Before a court can grant a divorce, the following conditions must be met:</p>
<ul><li>The parties <span>must have been living apart</span> from one another for
    a period amounting to <span>four out of the previous five years</span>
    before the application is made. </li>
  <li>There must be no reasonable prospect of reconciliation. </li>
  <li>Proper arrangements must have been made or will be made for the spouse
    and any dependent members of the family such as children of either party
    and other relatives.</li>
</ul><p>Living apart is given a unique definition by the courts where parties can be
"living apart" and still reside in the same dwelling. In those circumstances,
evidence is required to show that the parties lead separate lives, for example,
sleeping apart, organising their finances separately, and caring for the
children separately.</p>

<p>The provision that the couple must live apart for 4 out of the previous 5
years is to allow parties to attempt reconciliation, during which time they may
live together for a short period.</p>

<p>If the above conditions are met, either party to a marriage may apply to
court for a decree of divorce. When applying for a divorce you must submit 4
documents to the <a shape="rect" href="../../../justice/courts_system/circuit_court.html">Circuit Court</a>:</p>
<ul><li>An application form (known as a family law civil bill). This document
    describes both you and your spouse, your occupations and where you live. It
    also sets out when you married, how long you have been living apart for and
    the names and birth dates of your children. </li>
  <li>A sworn statement of means (Form 37A). This document sets out your
    assets, your income, your debts, your liabilities and your outgoings. </li>
  <li>A sworn statement relating to the welfare of your children (Form 37B).
    This document sets out the personal details of the children of the
    marriage. It describes where they live and whot they live with. It also
    describes their education and training, their health, childcare
    arrangements and maintenance and access arrangements. </li>
  <li>A document certifying that you have been advised of the alternatives to
    divorce (Form 37D). This document is sworn by a solicitor and it certifies
    that you have been advised about alternative dispute resolution, including
    the options of mediation and separation. </li>
</ul><p>When all of the necessary documents have been filed, you will be given a
date for the court hearing. The hearing will be held in private and you will
need to show the court that you meet the requirements of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0033/index.html">Family
Law (Divorce) Act 1996</a>. You can read more about the <a shape="rect" href="factors_in_separation_divorce.html">factors considered by a court in a
divorce case here</a>. If the court is satisfied that you have grounds for a
divorce, it will grant a decree of divorce.</p>

<p>You are not legally required to use a <a href="../../justice/courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a> or a <a href="../../justice/courtroom/barristers.html">barrister</a>. In fact, if
you wish, you can choose to represent yourself. However, there may be complex
issues that may make it very difficult to apply for a divorce without any
professional help. </p>

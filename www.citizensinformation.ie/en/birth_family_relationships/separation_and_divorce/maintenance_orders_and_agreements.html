<p>There is a legal responsibility on parents, whether married or unmarried, to
maintain dependent children and on spouses/civil partners to maintain each
other in accordance with their means. Maintenance can be paid periodically
(i.e., weekly or monthly) or in a lump sum. Paying maintenance <span>does
not</span> in itself give a parent access or guardianship rights.</p>

<p>Under the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of
Cohabitants Act 2010, a financially dependent qualified cohabitant may be able
to apply to the courts for a maintenance order if the relationship ends. See
our document on the <a href="../problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/redress_scheme_for_cohabiting_couples.html">redress
scheme for cohabiting couples</a>.</p>

<h3>Voluntary maintenance</h3>

<p>In situations where parents or spouses/civil partners are separated, they
can make informal agreements regarding maintenance. This can work well where
both parties are reasonable and fair - but it is difficult to assess informally
how much maintenance should be paid. You might consider sitting down and
writing out the actual expenses (weekly, monthly, etc.). If you find it
difficult to come to an arrangement which satisfies both parties, you may find
that mediation can help. Alternatively, each side can engage their own legal
advice who will act as negotiator of an agreement. Both parties can then sign
this agreement which can later be made a rule of court. A rule of court means
that these agreements have the same effect as a maintenance order (see below).
A solicitor cannot act for both sides in this situation, given that there may
be conflicts of interest. </p>

<p>Informal agreements such as this can include a property transfer or a lump
sum payment but it <span>cannot</span> rule out the possibility of applying for
a maintenance order through the courts in the future. </p>

<h3>Maintenance orders</h3>

<p>If the parties cannot agree upon maintenance, either party can apply to
court for a maintenance order. An application for maintenance can be brought
either in the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/district_court.html">District</a> or <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/circuit_court.html">Circuit
Court</a>.</p>

<p>A person seeking a maintenance order can represent himself or herself.
However, a person seeking a maintenance order should always check to see if
they are eligible for legal aid or contact a private solicitor to assess the
cost of the application. The cost of the application can be awarded against the
party refusing to pay maintenance if a judge considers it appropriate.</p>

<p>Maintenance can be awarded to a spouse/civil partner for their own benefit
and/or for the benefit of a dependent child who is under the age of 18, or 23
if the child is in full-time education. If the child is over 18 and under 23
and the financial circumstances do not allow him/her to attend further
education, maintenance can be applied for in order to facilitate further
education. If the child has a mental or physical disability to such a degree
that it will not be possible for the child to maintain him/herself fully, then
<span>there is no age limit for seeking maintenance</span> for their support.
</p>

<p>Each party must disclose their finances to the court and the judge will
consider all of the family's circumstances when making a maintenance order.</p>

<h3>Enforcing a maintenance order</h3>

<p>In cases where a parent/spouse/civil partner fails to comply with a court
order and does not pay the amount awarded, an <span>attachment of earnings
order</span> can be sought from the court, if the person is in employment or on
a private pension. This order results in the maintenance amount being deducted
at source by the parent's/spouse's/civil partner's employer. If the
parent/spouse/civil partner is self-employed, an <span>enforcement
summons</span> can be applied for. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/bills28/acts/2011/a2311.pdf">Civil
Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011</a> has amended the legislation to give
the District Court the power to regard a failure by a parent/spouse/civil
partner to comply with a court order as contempt of court and to deal with it
accordingly, including by means of imprisonment</p>

<p>The District Court in making a maintenance order can direct that the payment
under the order be made to the District Court Clerk if the court considers that
it would be proper to do so. The Circuit Court may as part of its order direct
that a maintenance order is payable through the District Court. The District
Court has a fully computerised payments system for the receipt and transmission
of payments received. </p>

<h3>Maintenance following separation, divorce and dissolution</h3>

<p>Under Irish law, there is no clean break from the obligation to support
one's spouse/civil partner and children. A clause in a separation agreement
stating that a spouse/civil partner will not seek maintenance in the future or
seek increased maintenance is unenforceable. The spouse/civil partner can apply
for a maintenance order and a court will consider this application,
particularly if the circumstances of the parties have changed or the
spouse/civil partner who executed the agreement did not have legal advice at
the time.</p>

<p>A divorced spouse can also apply to a court for a maintenance order or a
variation of a maintenance order after the divorce decree has been granted.
Similarly, a former civil partner can apply to the court for a maintenance
order or a variation of a maintenance order after the dissolution decree has
been granted. The only bar to an application is where the the spouse/civil
partner applying for the order has remarried or entered into a new civil
partnership.</p>

<h3>Maintenance from abroad</h3>

<p>Ireland is party to various international conventions and there are also EU
Regulations which facilitate the recovery of maintenance from abroad. See our
document on the <a href="../eu_and_family_law.html">EU and family law</a>.
</p>

<p>If you wish to obtain maintenance from someone living abroad, contact the
Central Authority for Maintenance Recovery in the Department of Justice and
Equality for help - see 'Contacts' below. You must have an address for the
other party.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you wish to appeal the decision of the court about a maintenance order,
you can do so within 14 days or apply to the court for an extension of time to
appeal. You should seek legal advice regarding your appeal.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>If both parties agree, the amount of maintenance to be paid can be agreed
between the parties. If the parties cannot agree on the amount of maintenance
to be paid, it will be necessary to apply to the District or Circuit Court,
depending on the amount of maintenance that is sought. </p>

<p>At present, the District Court can award any amount up to €500 per week
for a spouse/civil partner, and €150 per week for each child. If sums greater
than these amounts are being sought, you will need to apply to the Circuit
Court. </p>

<h3>Varying the amount of maintenance</h3>

<p>It is advisable to update weekly maintenance payments annually. Where
maintenance orders have been made through the courts, either party can at a
later date apply to the court to have the amount varied. (Varied means having
the amount increased or decreased). In order to do this, you will require a
variation order. </p>

<h3>Arrears of maintenance</h3>

<p>If a parent/spouse/civil partner falls behind with payments where there is a
maintenance order in place, then it is possible to apply to the court for an
attachment of earnings summons. It is possible to get this attachment at the
time when you apply for the maintenance order if you fear there may be a
default. (In other words, you fear that the other parent/spouse/civil partner
may fail to comply with the maintenance order). If the other
parent/spouse/civil partner is self-employed, an enforcement summons can be
applied for. </p>

<p>If the other parent/spouse/civil partner lives abroad, you should contact
the Central Authority for Maintenance Recovery (see 'Contacts' below). You must
have an address for the other party. This process may be lengthy but generally
involves no legal costs. </p>

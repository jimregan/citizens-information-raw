<p>The law in Ireland distinguishes between a <em>family home</em> and a
<em>shared home.</em> </p>

<h3>Family home</h3>

<p>A family home primarily means, a dwelling in which a married couple
ordinarily resides. Whilst some family homes are held in the sole name of one
spouse, many family homes are held in the names of both spouses as a <a href="../cohabiting_couples/property_rights_and_unmarried_couples.html">joint
tenancy</a> as this is often a condition of the mortgage used to buy the house.
The Government encourages spouses to put the family home into their joint names
and there is no stamp duty or registry fees payable on the transfer of a family
home into a joint tenancy.</p>

<h3>Shared home</h3>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Civil
Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010</a> a
shared home is a dwelling where civil partners ordinarily reside. Where the
shared home is held in the name of one of the civil partners, there is no stamp
duty or registry fees payable on the transfer of the shared home into both
their names as a joint tenancy.</p>

<h3>Home protection</h3>

<p>Protection is provided for the family home of a married couple under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1976/en/act/pub/0027/index.html">Family
Home Protection Act 1976</a> as amended by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0026/index.html">Family
Law Act 1995</a>. Similar protection is provided for the shared home of civil
partners by the civil partnership legislation. </p>

<p>This legislation prevents one spouse/civil partner from selling, mortgaging,
leasing or transferring the family/shared home without the consent of the other
spouse/civil partner. The courts can dispense with the other spouse's/civil
partnerâ€™s consent where it considers that the withholding of consent is
unreasonable. A spouse/civil partner is also able to apply to the courts for
orders restraining the other spouse/civil partner from doing anything that
might reduce his or her interest in the shared home or make it unsuitable to
live in.</p>

<p>A spouse/civil partner may inform the <a href="http://www.prai.ie/">Property
Registration Authority</a> that he or she is the spouse/civil partner of a
property owner. A notice to that effect will then be registered. There is no
charge for such a registration. There is no requirement to enter such a
registration and its absence does not affect the rights of a spouse/civil
partner.</p>

<p>The protection provided by the legislation is particularly important when
the home is held in the name of only one spouse/civil partner.</p>

<h3>Property adjustment order</h3>

<p>One of the biggest problems facing separating couples/partners is what
should happen to their family/shared home. If agreement cannot be reached as to
who will occupy and own the family/shared home, the court can make an order in
relation to it. </p>

<p>An order in relation to the family/shared home is usually applied for when
applying for a decree of judicial separation, divorce or dissolution and is
referred to as a <em>property adjustment order</em>.</p>

<p>In making a property adjustment order, a court will consider all of the
family circumstances and will take into account the welfare of a dependent
spouse/civil partner and any dependent children. The court order will state the
following:</p>
<ul><li>Who has the right to live in the family/shared home and for how long</li>
  <li>Who has ownership rights in the family/shared home and what share does
    each spouse/civil partner own</li>
</ul><h3>Who has the right to live in the home and for how long?</h3>

<p>In the case of a married couple where there are children, the spouse with
whom the children live will often be given the right to live in the family home
until the youngest child reaches 18 or 23. This can provide a sense of
continuity for children who are experiencing the separation of their parents.
The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/9/enacted/en/html">Children
and Family Relationships Act 2015</a> has amended the civil partnership
legislation to provide similar protection for dependent children of civil
partners. </p>

<p>The court can make an exclusion order in relation to the spouse/civil
partner who is leaving the family/shared home. An exclusion order reflects the
recognition of the courts that it is not practical for separated
couples/partners to occupy the same house or for the spouses/civil partners who
leave to retain a key and have free access to the house. It does not imply any
unacceptable conduct on the part of the spouses/civil partners who are excluded
from the house.</p>

<h3>Who has ownership rights in the home and what share does each spouse/civil
partner own?</h3>

<p>A court can order that the house is sold and the proceeds divided equally or
in whatever shares it considers just. It can order that the sale be deferred
for a specified period of time. It can order the transfer of the house into
joint names or into the sole name of one spouse/civil partner. If the house is
held under a tenancy from a local authority, it can order the transfer of the
tenancy.</p>

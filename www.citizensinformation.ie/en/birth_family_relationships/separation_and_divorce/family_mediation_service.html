<h3>What is mediation?</h3>

<p>Mediation is a service to help couples in Ireland who have decided to <a shape="rect" href="judicial_separation.html">separate</a> or <a shape="rect" href="divorce_decrees.html">divorce</a>, or who have already separated, to
negotiate their own terms of agreement, while addressing the needs and
interests of all involved. Mediation allows people to make their own
decisions.</p>

<h3>How can mediation help?</h3>

<p>The Family Mediation Service encourages the separating couple to co-operate
with each other in working out mutually acceptable arrangements on all or any
of the following:</p>
<ul><li>Parenting the children </li>
  <li>Financial support </li>
  <li>Family home and property </li>
  <li>Other problems related to the separation </li>
</ul><p>The role of the mediator is to:</p>
<ul><li>See a couple together and help them settle their differences. </li>
  <li>Create a climate in which neither party dominates but in which both
    parties participate fully in good faith. </li>
  <li>Create and maintain an atmosphere of co-operation and responsibility.
  </li>
  <li>Help couples deal with difficult emotional issues that can prevent them
    reaching agreement. </li>
  <li>Help couples reach agreement that they believe to be fair, equitable and
    workable. </li>
</ul><h3>How does the service operate?</h3>

<p>A professionally trained mediator assists the couple to reach their own
agreement.</p>
<ul><li>Both parties attend. </li>
  <li>Discussions are confidential. </li>
  <li>The mediator does not take sides. </li>
</ul><p>For an appointment with the Family Mediation Service, both parties must
contact the service and confirm their willingness to attend.</p>

<h3>How long does it take?</h3>

<p>Mediation usually takes between 2 and 6 sessions. Each session lasts
approximately one hour.</p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>

<p>Most mediations end with a written document that sets out all the details of
the couple's agreement. This can then be taken to solicitors to be drawn into a
Legal Deed of Separation and/or Decree of Divorce.</p>

<h3>What is a family session?</h3>

<p>When a couple has reached an agreement, a session is offered to parents to
invite their children in to discuss their new family arrangements.</p>

<h3>What are the advantages of mediation?</h3>

<p>These include:</p>
<ul><li>The Family Mediation Service is a confidential service. </li>
  <li>Each mediated agreement deals with the particular needs of the people
    involved. </li>
  <li>A balanced agreement is reached that is acceptable to both parties. </li>
  <li>Parents are helped to remain as partners in childrearing by developing
    parenting plans that are personal to each family. </li>

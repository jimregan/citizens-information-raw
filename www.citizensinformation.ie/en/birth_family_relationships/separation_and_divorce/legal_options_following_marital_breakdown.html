<p>When a marriage first breaks up, many couples informally separate and live
apart. Marital breakdown affects all areas of a person' s life, and most people
go on to regulate matters between them in a legal context. There are three
different ways of doing this in Ireland:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="separation_agreement.html">Separation
  agreement</a></li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="judicial_separation.html">Judicial
  separation</a></li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="divorce_decrees.html">Divorce</a></li>
</ul><p>A separation agreement is reached through agreement between the parties,
whereas a court grants a judicial separation or a divorce. Of these, only a
decree of divorce dissolves the marriage and allows each party to remarry.</p>

<p>In specific circumstances, a court can grant a <a shape="rect" href="../civil_annulment/nullity_of_marriage.html">nullity decree</a>. The
effect of a nullity decree is that the court determines that no marriage ever
existed. The law in relation to nullity is complex, and you should always seek
legal advice to assess whether the circumstances exist for a nullity
application. A Roman Catholic <span>church annulment has no legal
effect</span>.</p>

<p>When a couple cannot agree the terms by which they will live separately, an
application to the courts for a decree of judicial separation can be made by
either party. The court must be satisfied that:</p>
<ul><li>The grounds for the application exist. </li>
  <li>The couple has been advised about counselling and <a shape="rect" href="mediated_agreements.html">mediation</a>. </li>
  <li>Proper provision has been made for the welfare of any dependants </li>
</ul><p>If it is satisfied, the court will grant a decree of judicial separation.
The decree confirms that the couple is no longer obliged to live together as a
married couple. The court may also make orders in relation to custody and
access to children, the payment of maintenance and lump sums, the transfer of
property, the extinguishment of succession rights, etc. </p>

<p>An application for a judicial separation is made either in the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/circuit_court.html">Circuit Court</a>
or the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/high_court.html">High
Court</a>. As in all family law matters, cases are heard in private and the
public is not admitted to the courtroom. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You cannot apply for a judicial separation when you already have in force a
<a href="separation_agreement.html">separation agreement</a> which has been
made an order of court. An application for a judicial separation must be based
on one of the following six grounds:</p>
<ul><li>One party has committed adultery </li>
  <li>One party has behaved in such a way that it would be unreasonable to
    expect the other spouse to continue to live with them </li>
  <li>One party has deserted the other for at least one year at the time of the
    application </li>
  <li>The parties have live apart from one another for one year up to the time
    of the application and both parties agree to the decree being granted </li>
  <li>The parties have lived apart from one another for at least three years at
    the time of the application for the decree (whether or not both parties
    agree to the decree being granted) </li>
  <li>The court considers that a normal marital relationship has not existed
    between the spouses for at least one year before the date of the
    application for the decree. </li>
</ul><p>The last is by far the most common ground on which the decree is granted, as
neither party has to be shown as being at fault.</p>

<p>When you are applying for a judicial separation you must submit four
documents to the <a shape="rect" href="../../../justice/courts_system/circuit_court_civil_juris.html">Circuit
Court</a>:</p>
<ul><li>An application form (known as a family law civil bill). This document
    describes both you and your spouse, your occupations and where you live. It
    also sets out when you married, for how long you have been living apart and
    the names and birth dates of your children. </li>
  <li>A sworn statement of means. This document sets out your assets, your
    income, your debts and liabilities and your outgoings. </li>
  <li>A sworn statement relating to the welfare of your children. This document
    sets out the personal details of the children of the marriage. It describes
    where they live and with whom. It also describes their education and
    training, their health, childcare arrangements and maintenance and access
    arrangements. </li>
  <li>A document certifying that you have been advised of the alternatives to
    judicial separation. This document is sworn by a solicitor and it certifies
    that you have discussed the options of reconciliation, <a shape="rect" href="mediated_agreements.html">mediation</a> and <a shape="rect" href="separation_agreement.html">separation agreements</a>. </li>
</ul><p>When both you and your spouse have filed all of the necessary documents, you
will be given a date for the court hearing. The hearing will be held in private
and you will need to show the court that you meet the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1989/en/act/pub/0006/index.html">requirements
of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act 1989</a>. You can read
more about the <a href="factors_in_separation_divorce.html">factors
considered by a court in a judicial separation case here</a>. If the court is
satisfied that you have grounds for a judicial separation, it will grant a
decree.</p>

<p>A decree of judicial separation does not give you the right to remarry. </p>

<p>You are not legally required to use a <a href="../../justice/courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a> or a <a href="../../justice/courtroom/barristers.html">barrister</a>. In fact, if
you wish, you can choose to represent yourself. However, there may be complex
issues which may make it very difficult to apply for a judicial separation
without any professional help.</p>

<p>A decree of dissolution allows both parties to a civil partnership to marry.
If a court is satisfied that the required conditions (see Rules below) are met,
the court will grant the decree of dissolution, dissolving the civil
partnership. When it grants the decree of dissolution, the court may also make
orders in relation to the payment of <a shape="rect" href="maintenance_orders_and_agreements.html">maintenance</a> and lump sums,
the transfer of property, the extinguishment of succession rights, <a shape="rect" href="sep_divorce_pensions.html">pension</a> rights etc. </p>

<p>The fact that the parties must have been living separate lives for a couple
of years before an application for a dissolution is made, means that separating
civil partners may enter into a <a shape="rect" href="separation_agreement.html">separation agreement</a> to regulate matters
between them before they seek a dissolution </p>

<p>In any application for a decree of dissolution, the court can review any
previous arrangements made by the parties such as a separation agreement,
particularly if the circumstances of either party has changed. </p>

<p>When a decree of dissolution is granted, it cannot be reversed. Either party
can apply to court to have any orders made under the decree - such as
maintenance - reviewed by the court. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Before a court can grant a dissolution, the following conditions must be
met:</p>
<ul><li>The parties <span>must have been living apart</span> from one another for
    a period amounting to <span>2 out of the previous 3 years</span> before the
    application is made. </li>
  <li>Proper arrangements must have been made or will be made for the civil
    partners and any dependent child of the civil partners. </li>
</ul><p>If these conditions are met, either party to a civil partnership may apply
to court for a decree of dissolution.</p>

<p>When applying for a dissolution you will be required to submit 3 documents
to the <a href="../../justice/courts_system/circuit_court.html">Circuit
Court</a>:</p>
<ul><li>An application form (known as a family law civil bill). This document
    describes both you and your civil partner, your occupations and where you
    live. It also sets out when you registered your civil partnership, for how
    long you have been living apart and the names and birth dates of your
    children.</li>
  <li>A sworn statement of means (Form 51). This document sets out your assets,
    your income, your debts, your liabilities and your outgoings.</li>
  <li>A sworn statement relating to the welfare of any dependent children (Form
    37B). This document sets out the personal details of the children. It
    describes where they live and with whom. It also describes their education
    and training, their health, childcare arrangements and maintenance and
    access arrangements. </li>
</ul><p>There is no requirement to submit a document certifying that you have been
advised of the alternatives to dissolution, as is required in divorce
applications. </p>

<p>When all of the necessary documents have been filed, you will be given a
date for the court hearing. The hearing will be held in private and you will
need to show the court that you meet the requirements of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Civil
Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010</a>. If
the court is satisfied that you have grounds for a dissolution, it will grant a
decree of dissolution. </p>

<p>You are not legally required to use a <a href="../../justice/courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a> or a <a href="../../justice/courtroom/barristers.html">barrister</a>. In fact, if
you wish, you can choose to represent yourself. However, there may be complex
issues which may make it very difficult to apply for a dissolution without any
professional help.</p>

<p>Legal advice and representation is <span>always advisable</span>. If you and
your civil partner disagree about any issue at all it is strongly advised that
you go to see a family law solicitor. You and your civil partner should not use
the same solicitor.</p>

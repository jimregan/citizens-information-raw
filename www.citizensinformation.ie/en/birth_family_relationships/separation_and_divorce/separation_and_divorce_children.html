<h3>Guardianship</h3>

<p>Guardianship describes the legal responsibility of parents to make decisions
and perform duties in relation to their child's upbringing. Married parents are
automatically joint guardians of their children. Neither separation nor divorce
changes this. (A father who is not married to the mother of his child
<span>does not have automatic guardianship rights </span>in relation to that
child. You can read more in our document about the <a shape="rect" href="../married_couples/guardianship_status_of_fathers.html">guardianship
status of fathers</a>). </p>

<h3>Custody</h3>

<p>Custody refers to the day-to-day care, residency and upbringing of children
who are regarded as dependent children. Dependent children in custody matters
are children who are under the age of 18. In cases of judicial separation or
divorce, one parent is usually granted custody. The children reside permanently
with the parent who has custody and the other parent is granted access to the
children at agreed times, which can include overnight access. It is possible
for parents to continue to have joint custody of their children after
separation or divorce and for the children to spend an equal amount of time
with each parent if the parents can agree and arrange this.</p>

<h3>Access</h3>

<p>Access refers to the right of a child to maintain direct contact with the
parent with whom the child does not reside. It can include the child staying
overnight either occasionally, on alternate weekends or during school holidays
and for the parent and child going on holidays together.</p>

<p>The parents may agree informally between themselves the arrangements for
custody and access to the child. </p>

<p>In the event that agreement cannot be reached, either parent may make an
application to the court to decide which parent will have custody of the child
and what access the non-custodial parent will have. The application can be made
to the District Court or can be made in an application for <a shape="rect" href="judicial_separation.html">judicial separation</a> or divorce in the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/circuit_court.html">Circuit
Court</a>.</p>

<p>In any application for custody or access, it is the welfare of the child
that is the most important factor that a court will consider. It is a child's
right to see both parents and access by the non-custodial parent will only be
denied if the court believes that it is not in the best interest of the child.
The court can set out the time, place and duration of access visits and can
order supervised access where another adult is present during visits if it
considers it appropriate.</p>

<p>A person seeking an access order can go to their local <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/district_court.html">District Court</a> and get
the Court Clerk to issue an application for access, which will be served on the
other spouse. Legal advice and representation is always advisable.</p>

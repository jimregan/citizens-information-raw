<p>If a married couple or civil partners can agree the terms on which they will
live separately, they may enter into a <em>separation agreement</em>. The
essence of a separation agreement is that it is an agreement. Both parties must
consent to the terms of the agreement. </p>

<p>The agreement is a legally binding contract setting out each party's rights
and obligations to the other. The terms of the agreement are usually reached
either through mediation or negotiation through solicitors. If agreement can be
reached reasonably quickly between the parties and a separation agreement drawn
up, it is cheaper and less stressful than taking a court case. Many couples
formalise their separation in this way.</p>

<h3>Mediation </h3>

<p>Mediation is not marriage counselling. Its purpose is <span>not</span> to
help a couple to reconcile. Its purpose is to aid couples who have decided to
separate to resolve any disputes they may have in relation to the key issues
such as custody and access to children, maintenance and property rights. The
mediator is neutral and encourages the separating couple to co-operate with
each other in working out mutually acceptable arrangements that they will stick
to. Any separating couple can avail of mediation, whether they are married or
not. This includes same-sex couples.</p>

<p>Mediation normally takes up to six or seven sessions but this can vary
depending on complexity. If agreement is reached, the mediator will draw up the
terms of the agreement. It is recommended that people seek independent legal
advice before signing the agreement. </p>

<p>Mediation is confidential and any communication with a mediator is not
admissible if agreement is not reached and there are subsequent court
proceedings. </p>

<p>It is advisable for couples who opt for mediation to ensure that they obtain
legal and financial advice before attending mediation so that they know their
rights and can make informed decisions. </p>

<h3>Negotiation through solicitors</h3>

<p>Where the agreement is negotiated through solicitors, each party must have
their own solicitor to ensure that they receive independent legal advice.</p>

<h3>Collaborative practice</h3>

<p>Collaborative practice is a way of resolving family law matters, including
separation and divorce. Both you and your spouse/partner work with
collaborative lawyers. Everyone signs an agreement disqualifying your
collaborative lawyers from representing you in court if the process breaks
down. Neither lawyer can act for you in any contested court proceedings.</p>

<p>Through face-to-face meetings, you and your spouse/civil partner discuss and
resolve issues such as custody and access to children, maintenance and property
rights. The process is dependent on both parties making full and frank
disclosure of all of their assets so that negotiations can be open and
honest.</p>

<p>If the process is successful you will have an agreement with your
spouse/civil partner which you will both have had responsibility for. </p>

<p>Not every lawyer is trained in collaborative law and it is likely to be more
difficult to engage in the process if one of the lawyers is not so trained. <br></p>

<h3>Deed of Separation</h3>

<p>The actual document drawn up and signed by both parties, when they reach
agreement, is often called a <em>Deed of Separation</em> and is a legally
binding written contract. The main issues dealt with in a separation agreement
are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>An agreement to live apart </li>
  <li>Agreed arrangements in relation to <a shape="rect" href="separation_and_divorce_children.html">custody and access to
    children</a> </li>
  <li>The occupation and ownership of the <a shape="rect" href="family_home.html">family/shared home</a> and any other property </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="maintenance_orders_and_agreements.html">Maintenance
    and any lump sum payments</a> </li>
  <li>Indemnity from the debts of the other spouse/civil partner </li>
  <li>Taxation </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="succession.html">Succession rights</a> . </li>
</ul><p>It can be made into a rule of court by application to the court. This
ensures that all the terms agreed upon can be legally enforced where covered by
appropriate legislation. <a href="http://www.courts.ie/Courts.ie/Library3.nsf/PageCurrent/BD2B176CE4691FDB80257FB50050A466?opendocument&amp;l=en">Information

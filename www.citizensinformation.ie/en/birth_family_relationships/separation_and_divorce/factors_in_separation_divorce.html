<p>In granting a decree of judicial separation, divorce or dissolution, a court
has the power to make a wide variety of ancillary orders. The most usual court
orders relate to the following:</p>
<ul><li>Custody of and access to children</li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="maintenance_orders_and_agreements.html">Maintenance</a> and lump sum
    payments</li>
  <li>Ownership of the <a shape="rect" href="family_home.html">family/shared
    home</a></li>
  <li>Occupation of the family/shared home</li>
  <li>Ownership of property and assets such as shares</li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="sep_divorce_pensions.html">Pension rights</a></li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="succession.html">Succession rights</a>.</li>
</ul><p>There is no standard or usual amount of maintenance payable just as there is
no standard set of circumstances in which a court will make a particular order
in relation to the family or shared home. When considering what orders to make
in each particular case, a court will consider all of the circumstances of the
family/civil partners and will look in particular at the following:</p>
<ul><li>The current and likely future income, earning capacity and assets of each
    party</li>
  <li>The current and future financial needs and obligations of each party</li>
  <li>The standard of living of the family before the break-up of the
    marriage/civil partnership – the court will take this into account, but
    in reality it will accept that, in many cases, separation will result in a
    drop in the standard of living of both parties</li>
  <li>The age of each party, the duration of the marriage/civil partnership and
    the length of time the spouses/civil partners lived together</li>
  <li>The accommodation needs of each party</li>
  <li>The input each spouse/civil partner has made and is likely to make to the
    welfare of the family – this includes any contribution made that
    increased the income and financial resources of the other party</li>
  <li>The degree to which the marriage/civil partnership affected each party's
    ability to earn</li>
  <li>The conduct of each party</li>
  <li>The value of any benefits given up by a party because of the judicial
    separation, divorce or dissolution</li>
  <li>The rights of any other person affected by the judicial separation,
    divorce or dissolution</li>
</ul></div>

<p>After the <a shape="rect" href="family_home.html">family or shared home</a>,
the most valuable asset which a separating couple/civil partners have is often
a pension. Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1995_0026.htm">Family
Law Act 1995</a>, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1996_0033.htm">Family
Law (Divorce) Act 1996</a> and the <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/en_act_2010_0024.htm">Civil
Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010</a> a
court now has the power to treat a pension <span>as an asset</span> of the
separating couple/civil partners and order that it be divided into whatever
shares it considers appropriate. Such an order is known as a <em>pension
adjustment order</em>. For example if one spouse has a substantial pension and
the other spouse who worked in the home has no pension the court can order that
part of the spouses pension be paid to the other spouse or to a dependant
child. </p>

<p>The court can also order that part of the pension fund is split and placed
into another pension fund in the name of the other spouse/civil partner. </p>

<p>The court will consider all of the financial resources available before
making a pension adjustment order. Where the court does not make a pension
adjustment order it may take into account the value of the pension and reflect
this when making other financial orders. The court can make such an order when
granting a decree of judicial separation, divorce or dissolution, or either
spouse can apply to court for such an order once a decree has been granted.</p>

<p>When a pension adjustment order is granted by a court it is served on the
trustees of the spouse's/civil partner's pension scheme who make the necessary
adjustments to the provisions of the scheme in relation to that particular
member. Pension schemes are administered by trustees who are bound to
administer the scheme by the terms set out in the trust deed and rules. The
trustees are not entitled to alter the terms of the trust and make provision
for a person who is outside the scope of the scheme even if the member requests
them to do so. For example the terms of a trust could make provision for a
member's spouse such as a survivor's pension and this will be payable to the
member's lawful spouse even though the member may have been separated for many
years and have a second partner. Terms contained in a separation agreement in
relation to pensions may not be enforceable against the trustees or legally
binding.</p>

<p>Pensions are particularly complex and specialist advice must always be
sought in relation to the value of a pension. You can find <a href="../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/">information on pensions
here</a>.</p>

<p>Before a court grants a decree of judicial separation, divorce or
dissolution each spouse/civil partner should have fully revealed all of the
financial resources to the other spouse/civil partner. This includes full
details of any pension which a spouse/civil partner may have. If a spouse/civil
partner refuses to disclose the details of their pension the other spouse/civil
partner can seek this information directly from the trustees of the pension
scheme under the provisions of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0025/index.html">Pensions
Act 1990</a>.</p>

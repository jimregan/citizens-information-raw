<p>The rules governing the presumption of paternity may have an effect when a
child is claiming an <a shape="rect" href="../married_couples/marital_status_and_inheritance.html">inheritance</a>
or <a shape="rect" href="maintenance_orders_and_agreements.html">maintenance</a>. </p>

<p>The children of parents who <span>are</span> married to each other are
presumed in law to be the child of their mother's husband. </p>

<p>Section 88 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2015/en/act/pub/0009/index.html">Children
and Family Relationships Act 2015</a> amended the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1987/en/act/pub/0026/index.html">Status of
Children Act 1987</a> so that the presumption that a womanâ€™s husband is the
father of the child no longer applies if the child is born more than 10 months
after they separated. </p>

<p>The children of parents who are <span>not</span> married to each other may
have to prove paternity in order to get their maintenance or inheritance
entitlements. This isn't necessary if the father acknowledges paternity or is
named as the child's father on the birth certificate. If he acknowledges
paternity, he can agree to have his name added to the birth certificate at a
later date. </p>

<p>If the alleged father disputes paternity, he may agree to a medical
paternity test. If he doesn't agree to this, it is up to the court (usually the
<a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/district_court.html">District
Court</a>) to decide on paternity. </p>

<p>Where someone refuses to give a sample, the court can draw whatever
conclusions it thinks proper from the refusal. For example, if the alleged
father refused to give a sample, the court may take the view that he was afraid
the tests would indicate he was the father. If the mother refused to give a
sample, the court may take the view she was afraid the test may prove the named
man was not the father.</p>

<p>Appeals from the District Court are heard in the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/circuit_court.html">Circuit Court</a>.</p>

<h3>Paternity testing</h3>

<p>Paternity testing is carried out using blood, hair or swabs from the mouth.
You can either contact the laboratory yourself (they will ask you to select a
GP to undertake the tests), or you can go to one of the specialist agencies
that will organise the test for you. It is important to be aware, that you
<span>cannot use the test results </span>to have the father's name placed on
the birth certificate without his consent. </p>

<p>If a father wants to carry out a paternity test to establish legal paternity
in order that it would stand up in court, then all 3 parties (mother, father,
child) would need to be tested, so the mother would have to agree to this
test.</p>

<p>Children must be 3 months old before blood testing can be undertaking for
paternity testing purposes. However, a mouth swab of the child can be taken
from birth and used for the test. For identification purposes, photos are
required of those giving samples.</p>

<h3>Declaration of parentage</h3>

<p>A person or persons may apply to the Circuit Court for a declaration stating
that they are or are not the father, mother or parents of a child. Similarly, a
child (as an adult) can apply for a declaration stating that a person or
persons named is or is not their father, mother or parents.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Costs of paternity testing vary, depending on the type of test selected.
(The most common methods of testing are a blood test, or oral (mouth) swab for
the mother, father and child). Paternity testing is not part of the public
health system and <span>you will have to pay </span>for any tests conducted.
</p>

<p>Depending on the circumstances of the individuals involved, the court may
make an order for costs, and the parent(s) may be required to make a
contribution to the overall cost. </p>

<p>Many women suffer "the baby blues" during the first weeks after childbirth.
Giving birth can be a highly emotional and physically traumatic experience and
the sudden drop in hormone levels following birth can leave you emotionally and
physically drained. You may feel weepy, hyper-sensitive, anxious and alone in
the world. About 80% of women feel like this and will experience "the baby
blues" at some point following the birth of their baby. These feelings will
usually pass, with some rest and physical and moral support from your partner,
family and friends. </p>

<p>However, you may be one of the 10% of women who go on to develop postnatal
depression. Postnatal depression usually begins 2 to 8 weeks following birth,
but can sometimes appear up to 6 months or even a year after birth.
Unfortunately, many women experience this form of depression without even being
aware of the symptoms or the fact that postnatal depression is a real illness.
They experience some of the following feeling: </p>
<ul><li>Deep despondency</li>
  <li>Tearfulness</li>
  <li>Feeling that you can't cope with your baby </li>
  <li>Exhausted but unable to sleep</li>
  <li>Poor appetite </li>
  <li>Excessive anxiety about your baby </li>
</ul><p>If you are experiencing some of these feelings, you may be suffering from
postnatal depression and you should ask for help. Talk to your <a shape="rect" href="../../health/gp_and_hospital_services/">family doctor (GP)</a> or <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/care_in_your_community/public_health_nurses.html">public health
nurse</a> or someone you can trust. If you don't feel up to making an
appointment to see your GP or public health nurse, ask someone to do this for
you or arrange for a home visit. </p>

<p>Healthcare professionals have experience with this type of depression - they
will listen to you, and will be able to discuss available options with you.
Postnatal depression can happen to any woman and can occur at any time after
your baby is born - treatment is very successful, so it is important to
recognise the symptoms and seek help. </p>

<p>If you have had your baby recently, the maternity hospital may be able to
help. Contact the midwife or doctor who cared for you during your pregnancy. It
is possible you may be referred to the hospital psychiatrist, who will discuss
your depression with you and will look at available supports. The hospital
social work department will also be able to help.</p>

<h3>Advice for family and friends</h3>

<p>If your partner, family member or someone you know is suffering from
postnatal depression, it is important to recognise the symptoms and remember
that this illness is very real but also very treatable. As a friend or family
member, you will need to provide lots of support and help - as with all
illnesses, recovery may be slow and there will be good and bad days. The Health
Service Executive (HSE) has produced a free booklet, <a shape="rect" href="https://www.healthpromotion.ie/hp-files/docs/HPM00043.pdf">Postnatal
Depression (pdf)</a> which may be of assistance. Any of the following
organisations can offer friendship, advice and support. </p>

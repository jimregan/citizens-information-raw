<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Under the <span>Maternity and Infant Care Scheme</span> (the scheme that
provides free antenatal and postnatal care), mother and baby are entitled to
two visits to your family doctor (<acronym title="general practitioner">GP</acronym>) after the baby is born. The first
visit is when the baby is 2 weeks old, and the second is at 6 weeks. </p>

<p>The visit at 2 weeks is primarily to re-establish contact with your GP and
to see how the mother and baby are getting on. The more widely known visit is
referred to as the "6-week check". You can either go to your GP or your
maternity hospital for this. The GP or the hospital paediatrician will examine
your baby to check his/her development. They will check the baby's weight,
length, head circumference and hips. They will discuss the baby's feeding
patterns and general health with you, and address any concerns you might
have.</p>

<p>Thereafter, your points of contact with the healthcare system will be via
your GP, who will <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/children_s_health/immunisations_for_children.html">immunise your
baby</a>, and your <a shape="rect" href="maternity_care_and_public_health_nurse.html">public health nurse</a>, who
will visit you at home. </p>

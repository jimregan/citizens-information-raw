<p>The benefits of breastfeeding for both you and your baby are enormous.
Breast milk provides all the nutrients your baby needs for growth and
development, it contains anti-bodies which can help your baby's immune system
and it assists the emotional well-being of both mother and baby. </p>

<p>Practically all mothers can breastfeed but it does take dedication and
commitment. You are more likely to succeed if you have support and all the
information you need. You will need to balance the baby's demands for milk with
your supply. This can take time, as does getting the feeding position right and
feeling comfortable with it. </p>

<p>You may find the first couple of weeks of breastfeeding uncomfortable and
very tiring, until your supply settles down and the baby learns how to feed
well, but as you gain in confidence, you become more relaxed. By the time your
baby is a couple of months old, you will be quite an expert. The HSE has useful
guides on breastfeeding at <a href="https://www.healthpromotion.ie/publication/fullListing?category=Breastfeeding&amp;searchHSE=">healthpromotion.ie</a>.

<h3>Breastfeeding and employment</h3>

<p>Under Section 9 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0028/index.html">Maternity
Protection (Amendment) Act 2004</a> certain women in employment who are
breastfeeding are entitled to take time off work each day in order to
breastfeed. The provision applies to all women in employment who have given
birth within the previous 6 months. Employers are not obliged to provide
facilities in the workplace to facilitate breastfeeding if the provision of
such facilities would give rise to considerable costs. At the choice of her
employer, the woman may therefore opt to:</p>
<ul><li>Breastfeed in the workplace or express breast milk, where facilities are
    provided in the workplace by the employer </li>
  <li>Have their working hours reduced (without loss of pay) to facilitate
    breastfeeding where facilities are not made available. </li>
</ul><p>Women who are in employment and are breastfeeding are entitled to take 1
hour (with pay) off work each day as a breastfeeding break. This time may be
taken as;</p>
<ul><li>One 60 minute break </li>
  <li>Two 30 minute breaks </li>
  <li>Three 20 minute breaks </li>
</ul><p>You should note, that breaks may be <span>longer</span> and <span>more
frequent</span> if agreed between the woman and her employer. Part-time workers
are also entitled to breastfeeding breaks, calculated on a pro-rata basis. </p>

<p>The provision for women to breastfeed at work was brought into effect
<span>on the 18th October, 2004</span> through <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/si/0654.html">SI 654 of 2004
Maternity Protection (Protection of Mothers who are Breastfeeding) Regulations
2004</a>. </p>

<p>The HSE have produced a useful guide for employers, employees and co-workers
entitled <a href="https://www.healthpromotion.ie/hp-files/docs/HPM00365.pdf">Breastfeeding
and Work (pdf)</a>. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Women that wish to exercise their rights to breastfeed in employment, must
notify their employer (in writing) of their intention to breastfeed at work.
You must confirm this information at least 4 weeks before the date you intend
to return to employment from maternity leave.</p>

<p>Employers can require the employee to supply the child’s birth certificate
(or some other document confirming the child’s date of birth). </p>

<p>If you find breastfeeding difficult, there are many people who can help and
reassure you:</p>
<ul><li>At the hospital or at home. The <span>midwife </span>will have had much
    experience with breastfeeding mothers and will be able to help you get
    started. Some are "lactation consultants" and have specific training in
    breastfeeding support. In addition, most hospitals run a weekly drop-in
    breastfeeding clinic. </li>
  <li><span>At the local health centre</span>. Breastfeeding support groups are
    run by the public health nurse. Meetings take place weekly, where you and
    other mothers can meet the nurse to discuss any problems you might have and
    to seek her advice. </li>
  <li><span>Breastfeeding counsellors</span>. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.cuidiu-ict.ie/">Cuidiu - The Irish Childbirth Trust</a>
    has a list of trained breastfeeding counsellors who will answer any queries
    you might have. They are available all over the country. Contact Cuidiu for
    the name of your nearest counsellor. In addition, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.lalecheleagueireland.com/">La Leche League</a> is a
    voluntary group which provides information and support to women who want to
    breastfeed their babies. Their services include telephone counselling and
    monthly group meetings. A list of La Leche League counsellors is provided
    in the telephone book under "La Leche League" - telephone the counsellor
    nearest you. </li>
  <li><span>Breastfeeding support groups.</span> Both Cuidiu and La Leche
    League organise breastfeeding support groups. Contact them for the number
    of your nearest group. Information on <a shape="rect" href="https://www.lalecheleagueireland.com/groups/">La Leche groups in your
    area is available here</a>. </li>

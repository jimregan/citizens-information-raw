<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Pregnancy and childbirth put a great strain on your body and it will take
time to recover, particularly if you have had a difficult labour or a Caesarean
section. You may have been ill after having your baby, or you may suffer from a
common range of minor ailments and infections that affect new mothers. Your
hospital or <a shape="rect" href="maternity_care_and_public_health_nurse.html">public health nurse </a>will
be able to supply you with details of local postnatal exercise classes.</p>

<p>If you have had a normal delivery, you will then have a check-up after
<span>2 weeks</span> and then after <span>6 weeks</span>. This will be carried
out either by your GP or by the hospital if you had your baby in hospital. Your
GP or hospital doctor will discuss any health problems with you and may take a
cervical smear. </p>

<p>For some women, <a shape="rect" href="breastfeeding.html">breastfeeding</a>
is established easily, but others find it takes longer to get comfortable. Some
find that the demands of a young baby and a new lifestyle make them feel low
and, sometimes <a shape="rect" href="supports_for_postnatal_depression.html">depressed</a>. This is quite
normal after having a baby and help is available. </p>

<p>You can find information on <a href="https://www.indi.ie/fact-sheets/fact-sheets-on-women-s-health/545-healthy-eating-during-pregnancy.html">healthy

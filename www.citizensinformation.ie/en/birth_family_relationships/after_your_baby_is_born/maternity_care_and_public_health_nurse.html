<p>If you have had your baby in hospital, your first point of contact will be
the <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/care_in_your_community/public_health_nurses.html">public health
nurse</a>, who will visit you shortly after you come home. They will have been
informed of the birth of your baby and will either call to your home or phone
you to make an appointment. (If you have had a <a shape="rect" href="../before_your_baby_is_born/home_birth.html">home birth</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../before_your_baby_is_born/flexible_maternity_services.html">domino
delivery</a>, your midwife will have already visited you).</p>

<p>Public health nurses can help you with the following :</p>
<ul><li><span>Advice and support</span>: Public health nurses have extensive
    experience of babies and children and will be able to answer any queries
    you might have. </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="breastfeeding.html">Breastfeeding</a>: Your public
    health nurse may run a <a href="http://breastfeeding.ie/support/what_help_is_available#after">breastfeeding
    support group</a> at your health centre, generally once a week. This will
    give you the opportunity to discuss any problems or queries you might have
    and to meet other breastfeeding mothers. </li>
  <li><span>Feeding:</span> When you begin to feed your baby solid food, your
    public health nurse will be able to advise you on developing a good
    balanced diet for your baby. </li>
  <li><span>Developmental Checks</span>: Examinations of your baby's
    development are provided free of charge at your local health centre. The
    public health nurse will check your baby's development against a series of
    "norms" for that age group. For example, at 9 months, the checks look at
    your baby's eyesight and hearing, motor development, vocalisation and
    general growth. </li>
</ul><p>The checks are generally carried out at 9 months, 18 months and 2 years, and
you will receive a reminder call from your public health nurse. If you do not,
call your local health centre to make an appointment. <span>The checks are not
mandatory</span>. The public health nurse is also a good first point of contact
should you have any concerns about your baby's development. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>You may find yourself parenting alone due to a variety of circumstances; it
may occur following the death, desertion or imprisonment of a spouse or
partner. A separation, divorce, dissolution or annulment of a marriage or civil
partnership can also result in a one-parent family. Parenting alone may be the
result of an unplanned pregnancy. </p>

<p>Whatever the reason you are parenting alone, there are a range of benefits
and entitlements you may be able to avail of, depending on your circumstances.
In addition, there are important legal issues you should be aware of that
affect those parenting alone. </p>

<h3>Social welfare payments</h3>

<p>If you are parenting alone you may be able to avail of certain social
welfare payments. <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child
Benefit</a> is payable for each child under 16 years of age, or under 18 years
of age if the child is in full-time education or has a disability. <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent
Family Payment</a> is a means-tested payment for men and women who are bringing
children up without the support of a partner. It is payable to an unmarried
person, a widow/widower/surviving civil partner, a prisoner's spouse/civil
partner, a separated or divorced person, one whose marriage/civil partnership
has been annulled or one whose civil partnership has been dissolved.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to a <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/death_related_benefits/widows_contrib_pension.html">Widow's,
Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension</a> if either you
or your deceased spouse has enough PRSI contributions. Under the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/occupational_injuries_benefit_overview.html">Occupational
Injuries Benefit Scheme</a>, a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's
Pension may be payable if the death was due to an occupational injury or
disease or an accident while travelling directly to or from work.</p>

<h3>Maintenance</h3>

<p>There is a legal responsibility on both spouses to maintain each other and
any dependent children in accordance with their means. Separated or divorced
parents are responsible for the maintenance of their children and may have
maintenance responsibilities in respect of each other, depending on the terms
of the separation or divorce.</p>

<p>Civil partners are also legally obliged to maintain each other and any
dependent children in accordance with their means and may have maintenance
responsibilities in respect of each other if the civil partnership is
dissolved, depending on the terms of the dissolution.</p>

<p>Cohabiting parents do not have a financial responsibility to each other but
both parents have a responsibility for the maintenance of their children. A
cohabitant who is a guardian of their partnerâ€™s child, or the child their
partner has the day-to-day care of, has a financial responsibility to the
child.</p>

<p>If a cohabiting relationship subsequently breaks down, you may have a right
to maintenance under the <a href="../problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/redress_scheme_for_cohabiting_couples.html">redress
scheme for cohabiting couples</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a shape="rect" href="maintenance_and_unmarried_couples.html">find
out about maintenance here</a>. There is also information on <a href="../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/maintenance_and_social_welfare_payments.html">how
maintenance is assessed for social welfare payments</a> and <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/maintenance_and_tax.html">how
maintenance affects your tax</a>.</p>

<h3>Taxation</h3>

<p>There are specific rules about taxation in the year of a person's death. For
example, a tax refund may be due. There are also extra credits for widowed
parents in the years following the death of a spouse. Read here for more
information about <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs_following_a_death.html">tax
in the year of death and the years following a death</a>. The Revenue
Commissioners have <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/personal/circumstances/bereavement/widows-widowers.html">information
on the tax treatment of widowed people and surviving civil partners here</a>.
Surviving civil partners are treated the same as widows/widowers for tax
purposes.</p>

here</a>.</p>

<h3>Guardianship</h3>

<p>Guardianship rights entitle the parent of a child to make important
decisions regarding that child's upbringing, for example, decisions on the
child's religion, education, medical treatment and where the child lives. All
mothers, irrespective of whether they are married or unmarried, have automatic
guardianship status in relation to their children, unless they give the child
up for adoption. </p>

<p>In addition, fathers married to the mother of their children also have
automatic guardianship rights. A father, however, who is not married to the
mother of his child does not have automatic guardianship rights in relation to
that child. Find out <a shape="rect" href="../unmarried_couples/legal_guardianship_and_unmarried_couples.html">more
about guardianship here</a>. Mothers who are sole guardians should <a shape="rect" href="/en/death/before_a_death/making_a_will.html">make a will</a>
appointing guardians of their children in the event of their own death.</p>

<h3>Custody and access</h3>

<p>Custody is the right to the physical care and control of a child. Access is
the right of a child to maintain direct contact with the parent with whom the
child does not reside. When the parents of a child separate and they cannot
agree on who should have custody of the child, the court decides. An unmarried
mother is the sole guardian of a child born outside of marriage. However, it is
not necessary for the father to have guardianship before he applies for <a shape="rect" href="../cohabiting_couples/access_to_children_and_unmarried_couples.html">access</a>
or <a href="../cohabiting_couples/custody_of_children_and_unmarried_couples.html">custody</a>.</p>

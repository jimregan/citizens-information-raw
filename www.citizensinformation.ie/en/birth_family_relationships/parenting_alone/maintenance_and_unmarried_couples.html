<h3>Spouses and partners</h3>

<p>If you are or have been married or in a civil partnership, you are entitled
to apply to the court for maintenance from your spouse/civil partner to cover
your own expenses. If you are in a cohabiting relationship, you have no such
right.</p>

<p>If the cohabiting relationship subsequently breaks down you may not apply to
the court for maintenance for yourself, unless you satisfy the eligibility
criteria for the <a href="../problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/redress_scheme_for_cohabiting_couples.html">redress
scheme for cohabiting couples</a>. You will have to show that you were/are
financially dependent on your partner. </p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>Married couples and civil partners are legally obliged to maintain their
dependent children in accordance with their means. Their maintenance
responsibilities following a judicial separation, divorce or dissolution are
determined by the courts.</p>

<p>If you have had a child outside of marriage and cannot come to an agreement
about maintenance, you may apply to the court to order the other parent to pay
child support. In most cases, it is the parent with main custody of the child
that makes such an application.</p>

<p>If the court decides that the parent of a dependent child has failed to
provide such maintenance for the child as "is proper in the circumstances", it
may order that parent to make regular maintenance payments to support the
child. The court may also order a parent to pay a lump sum.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2015/en/act/pub/0009/index.html">Children
and Family Relationships Act 2015</a> has amended the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1976/en/act/pub/0011/index.html">Family
Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976</a> so that a cohabitant who
is a <a href="../cohabiting_couples/legal_guardianship_and_unmarried_couples.html">guardian</a>
of:</p>
<ul><li>Their partner’s child or</li>
  <li>The child their partner has the day-to-day care of</li>
</ul><p>has a financial responsibility to the child. It allows for a court to order
the cohabitant to pay maintenance to support a dependent child who is under 18
years of age.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>A dependent child is a child who:</p>
<ul><li>Is under 18 years old or</li>
  <li>Is over 18 and under 23 years old but is still in full-time education
  or</li>
  <li>Is suffering from mental or physical disability to the extent that he or
    she cannot maintain himself or herself.</li>
</ul><p>When the court is deciding whether to make a maintenance order in respect of
a child, it will consider the income, earning capacity, property and other
financial resources of both parties. It will also consider whether either party
has other financial responsibilities such as a spouse or other dependent
children.</p>

<p>The children of parents who are not married to each other may have to <a shape="rect" href="../separation_and_divorce/presumption_of_paternity.html">prove
paternity</a> in order to get their maintenance or inheritance entitlements.
This is not necessary if the father acknowledges paternity or is named as the
child's father on the child’s birth certificate.</p>

on maintenance orders</a> and on the <a href="http://www.courts.ie/Courts.ie/Library3.nsf/PageCurrent/952BC25C89DD00D880257FB5004D3804?opendocument&amp;l=en">Courts

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>In Ireland, a <em>deed poll</em> is a signed declaration by a person that
binds them to a particular course of action from the date of signing. A deed
poll for a change of name contains declarations (in other words a sworn
statement or affidavit) that you are abandoning the use of your old name, that
you will use your new name at all times and that you require everyone to use
your new name.</p>

<h3>Changing your name after marriage</h3>

<p>There is <span>no legal or other obligation on anyone</span> in Ireland to
change their name on marriage. The fact that some people do, is purely based on
tradition and culture. They may, for example, wish to signify they have joined
a new family and therefore take the new name - but this is purely a social or
cultural choice and has no legal basis. </p>

<p>How you earn your name is by use and repute. Effectively this means for most
purposes, if someone wants to be known by their married name (or any other),
then they just use this name and ask people to call them by it. </p>

<h3>Changing the surname of a child</h3>

<p>The surname of a child can be changed in the <a shape="rect" href="../after_your_baby_is_born/registering_birth_your_baby.html">Register of
Births</a> but only in certain circumstances. However, the surname of a child
can also be changed by deed poll or common usage. Children aged between 14 and
17 years can execute the Deed Poll themselves but need the consent of both
parents. Where a child is under the age of 14 years, one of the child's parents
must execute the Deed Poll with the consent of the other parent.</p>

<h3>Changing your name by deed poll</h3>

<p>The advantage of changing your name by deed poll is that you then have
documentary evidence that you have changed your name. This, along with your
birth certificate, is acceptable for most administrative procedures and
provides an easy and inexpensive solution to most of the difficulties that can
arise when you change your name.</p>

<p>If you changed your name when you married, you do not need to execute a deed
poll as you have your marriage certificate as evidence of your name change.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Executing a deed poll</h3>

<p>Execution of a deed poll is a relatively simple process. You can get a
solicitor to do it or you can do it yourself. You declare that you have given
up a former name and adopted a new name for all purposes. You sign the deed
poll in the presence of a witness. The witness must also swear an affidavit
(called an ‘affidavit of attesting witness’) before a solicitor or
commissioner for oaths.</p>

<p>See ‘How to apply’ below.</p>

<h3>Enrolling the deed</h3>

<p>There is no requirement to enrol the deed poll in the Central Office of the
High Court as, generally, it has no greater effect than a deed poll which has
not been enrolled. However, some organisations, such as the National Driving
Licence Service (NDLS), will only accept a deed poll which has been enrolled.
If you are <a href="../changing_to_your_preferred_gender.html">applying for
a gender recognition certificate</a> and you wish to use a deed poll to change
your name, your deed poll must be enrolled.</p>

<p>The enrolment of a deed poll in the Central Office places your change of
name on a publicly accessible record. In addition, enrolling the deed poll
means that a record of the change of name is preserved for future
identification and a certified copy of the original enrolled deed poll can be
obtained if required.</p>

<p>To enrol your deed poll you must attend in person. You will have to bring
certain documentation as well as a completed application form. The application
form includes an acknowledgement that enrolling the deed results in it being
available for public inspection and published on the Courts Service website.</p>

<p>You also have to pay stamp duty on the deed poll.</p>

<p>See ‘How to apply’ below.</p>

<h3>Change of name licence for non-EU nationals</h3>

<p>Under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1935/en/act/pub/0014/index.html">Section 9
of the Aliens Act 1935</a>, a non-EU national aged 18 or over must get a change
of name licence from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS)
before executing a deed poll. You can obtain an application form for a change
of name licence by writing to the Change of Name Section in INIS.</p>

<p>There is more information on <a shape="rect" href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP07000033">change of name
licences</a> on the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service website.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>There is a small fee to have the affidavit of attesting witness sworn before
a <a href="../../justice/civil_law/commissioners_for_oaths.html">commissioner for
oaths</a> or a practising <a href="../../justice/courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a>.</p>

<p>There is no fixed rate of charges for legal fees, so you should enquire in
advance for information on such charges.</p>

<p>If you enroll the deed poll in the Central Office of the High Court, you
will have to pay stamp duty of €60.</p>

<p>To execute the deed poll, you can get a solicitor to do it or you can do it
yourself. You can download a <a href="http://www.courts.ie/offices.nsf/(WebFiles)/19D92A7D61354B0480257C6D005E9E4D/%24FILE/Template%20of%20Adult%20Deed%20Poll.doc">template
of an adult deed poll</a> from the Courts Service website. The deed poll must
be printed on deed paper (which is available from legal stationers). You sign
the deed poll in your old name and your new name. You must sign it in the
presence of a witness.</p>

<p>The witness must be at least 18 years of age. They must sign the deed poll
as witness. They must also swear an affidavit before a solicitor or
commissioner for oaths stating that they witnessed the signing of the deed
poll. You can download a <a href="http://www.courts.ie/offices.nsf/(WebFiles)/2FA463E1898E6E6880257C6D005F1A50/%24FILE/Affidavit%20of%20Attesting%20Witness%20for%20Adult.doc">template
of an affidavit of attesting witness</a> from the Courts Service website.</p>

<p>There is a small fee for swearing the affidavit before a solicitor or
commissioner for oaths.</p>

<p>If you want to change the name of a child by deed poll you should contact
the Central Office of the High Court and ask for examples of the necessary
documents.</p>

<h3>Enrolling</h3>

<p>There is no requirement to enrol the deed poll in the Central Office of the
High Court as it has no greater effect than a deed poll which has not been
enrolled. If you do want to enrol your deed poll you must attend the Central
Office in person. The service for personal callers to the Central Office is
available on Tuesday and Thursday mornings, from 10.00am to 12.30pm.</p>

<p>You will require:</p>
<ul><li>The deed poll executed correctly</li>
  <li>Evidence of your previous name (for example, a birth certificate,
    marriage certificate, previous name change by deed poll, certificate of
    naturalisation)</li>
  <li>A change of name licence (if you are a non-EU national)</li>
  <li>Photographic proof of identification</li>
</ul><p>You have to complete an application form. You can download an <a href="http://www.courts.ie/offices.nsf/(WebFiles)/F08B736C2C97B24B80257C6D005F3C30/%24FILE/Application%20to%20Enrol%20a%20Deed%20Poll.doc">application

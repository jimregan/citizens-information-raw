<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If a cohabiting couple splits up, the family home (and other family assets)
will belong to the person who holds the legal title to the home/assets. This
means that in the case of the family home, the person who originally bought the
house and whose name is on the <a href="../../housing/owning_a_home/buying_a_home/property_deeds.html">title
deeds</a> will usually own the house.</p>

<p>This also applies to a married couple who split up. Marriage does not
automatically give you ownership of your spouse’s assets. Where the family
home was bought and registered in both spouses’ names, they are the joint
owners. However, where the house is registered in the name of one spouse only,
it may be solely that spouse’s property.</p>

<p>You can read more about ownership in our documents on <a href="../separation_and_divorce/family_home.html">family homes</a> and <a href="../cohabiting_couples/property_rights_and_unmarried_couples.html">joint
ownership of property</a>.</p>

<p>If your relationship breaks down and your name is not on the title deeds to
the house, you may still be able to show that you have some ownership rights in
relation to the house. These rights are based on the fact that you made a
contribution to the purchase price of the house with the intention of gaining a
share in the ownership of the house. </p>

<p>Contributions to the purchase price of the house can be direct or indirect.
Direct contributions include contributions to the initial down payment for the
house or contributions to the mortgage installments. Indirect contributions may
include paying some of the other day-to-day household expenses or unpaid work
in the legal owner of the house's business. It has been held by the courts that
working in the home looking after children and money spent or work done on home
improvements are not contributions that give you any right of ownership in
relation to the house. </p>

<p>Usually, where you can show that you have made a contribution to the
purchase price of the house, you will be entitled to a share in the house in
proportion to your contribution. For example, if you have shown that you paid
off half of a mortgage that represented 90% of the purchase price, you would be
entitled to 45% of the ownership of the property. </p>

<p>As well as showing that you made a financial contribution to the purchase
price of the house, you must also show that your contribution was made with the
intention of gaining a share in the ownership of the house and that you were
not making a gift of the money to the legal owner of the house.</p>

<p>Under the <a href="redress_scheme_for_cohabiting_couples.html">redress
scheme for cohabiting couples</a> a property adjustment order is one of the
remedies available to the courts. A property adjustment order in relation to
the family or shared home is usually applied for when applying for a decree of
<a href="../separation_and_divorce/judicial_separation.html">judicial
separation</a>, <a href="../separation_and_divorce/divorce_decrees.html">divorce</a> or <a href="../separation_and_divorce/dissolution_decrees.html">dissolution</a>.</p>

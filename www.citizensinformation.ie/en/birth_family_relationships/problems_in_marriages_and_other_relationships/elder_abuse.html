<p>Elder abuse is recognised as a concern in Ireland. While most older people
do not experience abuse, unfortunately, there are some who are harmed or abused
by others.</p>

<h3>What is elder abuse?</h3>

<p>According to the <a href="http://health.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Report-of-the-Working-Group-on-Elder-Abuse.pdf">Report
of the Working Group on Elder Abuse: Protecting our Future (2002) (pdf)</a>
elder abuse is the abuse of someone aged 65 or over and it occurs within a
relationship where there is an expectation of trust. It is a single or a
repeated act, or a lack of appropriate action, that causes harm or distress to
the older person or that violates their human and civil rights.</p>

<h3>Where does it happen?</h3>

<p>Abuse can take place in any situation. It may occur when an older person
lives alone or with a relative. It may also occur within residential or
day-care settings, in hospitals, home support services and other places assumed
to be safe, or in public places.</p>

<h3>Are there different forms of elder abuse?</h3>

<p>There are different forms of elder abuse which may be carried out
deliberately, or through negligence or ignorance. An older person may
experience more than one form of abuse at any given time. The various forms of
abuse are:</p>
<ul><li>Psychological abuse</li>
  <li>Neglect and acts of omission</li>
  <li>Financial or material abuse</li>
  <li>Physical abuse</li>
  <li>Sexual abuse</li>
  <li>Discrimination</li>
</ul><p>Information on the various forms of elder abuse, and how to recognise the
signs, is available on the <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/olderpeople/elderabuse/">Health
Service Executive (HSE) website</a>.</p>

<h3>How do I report my concerns?</h3>

<p>The HSE has a dedicated elder abuse service, with <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/olderpeople/elderabuse/Protect_Yourself/SafeguarProtectTeams.html">Senior
Case Workers</a> in elder abuse working in most Local Health Office areas.</p>

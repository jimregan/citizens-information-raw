<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Domestic violence refers to the use of physical or emotional force or threat
of physical force, including sexual violence, in close adult relationships. As
well as physical violence it can also involve emotional abuse, the destruction
of property, isolation from friends, family and other potential sources of
support, threats to others including children, stalking, and control over
access to money, personal items, food, transportation and the telephone.</p>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/EN_ACT_1996_0001.PDF">Domestic
Violence Act 1996</a>, Gardaí (the Irish police force) have the power to
arrest and prosecute a violent family member. Under the law there are two main
kinds of protection available, a <span>safety order</span> and a <span>barring
order</span>. </p>

<h3>Safety order</h3>

<p>A safety order is an order of the court which prohibits the violent person
from further violence or threats of violence. It does not oblige the person to
leave the family home. If the person is not living with you it prohibits them
from watching or being near your home. A safety order can last up to 5
years.</p>

<h3>Barring order</h3>

<p>A <span>barring order</span> is an order which requires the violent person
to leave the family home. The order also prohibits the person from further
violence or threats of violence, and from watching or being near your home. A
barring order can last up to 3 years.</p>

<h3>Applying for an order</h3>

<p>To get a barring order or a safety order you must attend a District Court
hearing. While you are waiting for the court to hear your application, the
court can give you an immediate order called a <strong>protection
order</strong>. The protection order has the same effect as a safety order. In
exceptional circumstances the court can grant an <strong><span>interim barring
order</span></strong>. This is an immediate order, requiring the violent person
to leave the family home. </p>

<p>The safety order or the barring order can be renewed by applying for a
further order before the previous one has expired.</p>

<p>The court will grant an order where it believes that your safety or welfare,
or the safety or welfare of a dependant, requires that an order is granted.
Under the legislation, welfare includes both physical and psychological
welfare.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Spouses and civil partners</h3>

<p>If you are married or in a civil partnership, and you can show the court
that your spouse/civil partner is violent in any way towards you or the
children, you can get a barring or safety order against them no matter how long
you have lived together and even if they own most or all of the house.</p>

<h3>Cohabiting couples</h3>

<p>If you have lived together in an intimate and committed relationship you can
get a safety order against a violent partner. You can also get a safety order
against a person with whom you have had a child but are not living with or have
never lived with.</p>

<p>You can get a barring order against a violent partner if you have been
living together in an intimate and committed relationship for six out of the
previous nine months and your partner does not own most or all of the house you
are living in.</p>

<h3>Parents</h3>

<p>A parent can apply for a barring or safety order against domestic violence
from their own child if their child is over 18. You cannot get a barring order
if your child owns all or most of the house you are living in.</p>

<h3>Others living together</h3>

<p>Others living together, for example, two relatives, can apply for a safety
order.</p>

<h3>Child and Family Agency</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../family_support_agency.html">Child and Family
Agency</a> may seek a safety or barring order against a violent adult on behalf
of a child, whether or not that violent adult is married to the child's parent.
</p>

<h3>Penalties for offences</h3>

<p>The law in Ireland strictly provides that anyone who contravenes a safety,
barring (or interim barring) or protection order is guilty of an offence.
Furthermore, if someone prevents you or your dependents from entering or
remaining in a place to which the order relates (while the barring or interim
barring order is in effect), they are also guilty of an offence. </p>

<p>The above offences under the Domestic Violence Act 1996 are punishable by a
<a href="../../justice/criminal_law/criminal_trial/maximum_fines_on_summary_conviction.html">Class
B fine</a> and/or a prison term of 12 months. These penalties are set down in
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0001/sec0017.html#zza1y1996s17">Section
17 of the Domestic Violence Act, 1996</a>. </p>

<h3>Support</h3>

<p>If you are concerned about violence in your home, you should contact <a shape="rect" href="http://www.garda.ie/Stations/Default.aspx">your local Garda
Station</a>. Members of the Gardaí are specially trained to deal with these
situations and can offer advice, information and assistance. </p>

<p>Your local <a href="http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/">Citizens
Information Centre</a> can give you information about organisations that will
provide you with support. For example, two such organisations are Women's Aid
and Amen Support Services.</p>

<p>Women's Aid is a voluntary organisation providing support and information to
women and their children who are being physically, emotionally and sexually
abused in their own homes. If you are a woman living in a violent situation,
you should contact the Women's Aid helpline on 1800 341900.</p>

<p>Amen Support Services is a voluntary organisation which provides a
confidential helpline, a support service and information for male victims of
domestic abuse. You can contact Amen Support Services by phone at (046) 902
3718.</p>

<p>Further information on domestic and sexual violence as well as information
on local and national support services is available on the website of <a shape="rect" href="http://www.cosc.ie/en/COSC/Pages/Home">Cosc - The National
Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence</a>.

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>To apply for a barring order or a safety order you must go to your <a shape="rect" href="http://www.courts.ie/offices.nsf/webcobycounty">local
District Court Office</a>. If you live in the Dublin Area you must go to the
Dublin District Family Law Office (see 'Where to apply' below). However, you
can go to the Dublin District Court Offices in Swords if it is closer to you.
</p>

<p>When you get to the District Court Office, the Court staff will identify the
forms you need to make your application. You do not need a solicitor to make an
initial application, but it is recommend you have legal representation for a
full court hearing. You must bring proof of your identity, such as a passport
or driver's licence. You should mention any evidence you have for the full
hearing, including reports from your GP, hospital or the Gardaí.</p>

<p>If you are applying for a barring order or a safety order, the court clerk
will arrange a court date for a court hearing. You will be given your summons
for the court hearing at the time of your application. A summons will be sent
to the respondent by ordinary post. The respondent is the person you need to be
protected from or want barred from your home. </p>

<p>While you are waiting to go to court to get your barring order or safety
order, you can get a protection order or an interim barring order immediately.
If you want a protection order or an interim barring order the District Court
Judge will hear your case on the day you make your application for a barring
order or safety order. </p>

<p>If you do not want a protection order or an interim barring order
immediately, you can seek one at any time before your case is heard for a
barring or safety order.</p>

<p>When you get your barring order, safety order, protection order or interim
barring order, you show it to the Gardaí in your local Garda Station. <span>Do
not give them your order</span> (you can allow them to take a photocopy). A
copy of your order will be sent to the Superintendent of your local Garda
Station by registered post the following day. </p>

<p>A safety order, barring order, interim barring order or protection order
takes effect from the time the respondent is notified of the order. This can be
done verbally, together with the production of a copy of the order. If the
respondent is in court when the order is made the respondent is considered to
be notified. A copy of the order will be sent to the respondent by ordinary
post. In some cases, the Judge may direct the Gardaí 'to serve' the order on
the respondent . This means the Gardaí will hand the order directly to the
respondent. </p>

<p>A statutory civil partnership registration scheme for same-sex couples was
introduced in January 2011 under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Civil
Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010</a>. The
Act sets out the rights and obligations that civil partners have towards each
other. These are broadly the same as the rights and obligations of married
couples towards each. The Act did not change the law on issues relating to
children, for example, guardianship, adoption, custody, access or
maintenance.</p>

<p>Civil partners are treated in the same way as spouses under the tax and
social welfare codes. Necessary changes to the social welfare codes were made
through the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0037/index.html">Social
Welfare and Pensions Act 2010</a>. Taxation changes were made through the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0018/index.html">Finance
(No. 3) Act 2011</a>. See Revenue's <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/personal/faqs/taxation-civil-partnerships.pdf">Frequently
Asked Questions on Civil Partnership (pdf).</a></p>

<p>The Minister for Justice and Equality made orders recognising as civil
partnerships classes of legal relationships which were registered in other
countries and which met certain criteria.</p>

<h3>Marriage Act 2015</h3>

<p>Following the commencement of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/35/enacted/en/html">Marriage
Act 2015</a> on 16 November 2015 you can no longer register a civil
partnership. Couples already in a civil partnership can <a href="../getting_married/getting_married.html">apply to marry</a> or remain
as they are. If they marry their civil partnership is automatically
dissolved.</p>

<p>Partnerships registered abroad since 16 May 2016 are not recognised as civil
partnerships in Ireland.</p>

<p>You can find more information on the <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR15000577">Department of Justice and
Equality website</a>.</p>

<h3>Registering of civil partnershipships</h3>

<p>Under the scheme same-sex couples could register their relationship as a
civil partnership. The Registrar-General is obliged to maintain a register of
civil partnerships, a register of decrees of dissolution of civil partnerships
and a register of nullity of civil partnerships. The registration rules and
processes were broadly similar to those for the registration of a civil
marriage, annulments of marriage and divorce.</p>

<p>There were various reasons why you would not be allowed to become civil
partners – legally, these were known as impediments. The main ones were age,
close blood relationship and an existing valid marriage or civil
partnership.</p>

<p>The formalities were broadly similar to the formalities for marriage. Among
other things, this meant that you had to give three months’ notice of your
intention to enter into a civil partnership. A civil partnership ceremony had
to be held at an approved venue.</p>

<h3>Ending a civil partnership</h3>

<p>The courts are able to grant a <a href="../civil_annulment/nullity_of_civil_partnership.html">decree of
nullity of civil partnership</a> in broadly the same way as decrees of nullity
of marriage are granted. The courts are also able to dissolve civil
partnerships in a similar way to the granting of divorce. However, the rules
governing the <a href="../separation_and_divorce/dissolution_decrees.html">dissolution of
civil partnerships</a> are different. </p>

<p>Orders such as <a href="../problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/barring_safety_and_protection_orders.html">protection
orders</a>, <a href="../separation_and_divorce/maintenance_orders_and_agreements.html">maintenance
orders</a> and <a href="../separation_and_divorce/sep_divorce_pensions.html">pension
adjustment orders</a> may be made in the course of court proceedings for the
dissolution of civil partnerships in the same way as such orders may be made in
judicial separation and divorce proceedings.</p>

<p>Unlike divorce proceedings, the civil partners’ legal advisers are not
required to discuss the possibility of reconciliation, mediation or other
alternatives to dissolution. The court may, however, adjourn proceedings in
order to facilitate such alternatives.</p>

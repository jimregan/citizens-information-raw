<p>For the purposes of most social welfare claims (for example, <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
Allowance</a> and <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary
Welfare Allowance</a> claims) cohabiting couples, people in civil partnerships
and married couples are treated the same. However, your civil status will
affect your entitlement to <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/death_related_benefits/widows_contrib_pension.html">Widow's,
Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner’s (Contributory) Pension</a> or <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/death_related_benefits/widows_non_contrib_pen.html">Widow's,
Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner’s (Non-Contributory) Pension</a>.</p>

<p>You can only claim Widow's/Widower's/Surviving Civil Partner's Pension if
your civil partner dies. You will not be entitled to this pension if you enter
into a new civil partnership or marry.</p>

<p>If you are in doubt about how your civil status will affect your claim, you
should contact <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/ContactUs/Pages/localoffice.aspx">your local
social welfare office</a>. In the case of supplementary welfare allowance, you
should contact the Department of Social Protection's representative (formerly
known as the Community Welfare Officer) in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/maps/">your local Health Centre</a> or
local social welfare office.</p>

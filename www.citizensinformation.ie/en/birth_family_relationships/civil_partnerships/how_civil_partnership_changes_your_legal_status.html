<p>Civil partnership is a legally binding civil contract and gives rise to many
far-reaching legal consequences which are generally similar to the legal
consequences of getting married. </p>

<p>Civil partnership changes your entitlements and obligations regarding:</p>

</ul><h3>Other consequences of civil partnership</h3>

<p><strong>Civil liability: </strong>a surviving civil partner may sue in
respect of the wrongful death of their civil partner, where the death was
caused by the negligence or wrongdoing of another person and has resulted in
injury or mental distress to the survivor.</p>

<p><strong>Mental health: </strong>a civil partner may apply for the <a href="../../health/mental_health/admission_to_a_psychiatric_hospital.html">involuntary
admission to a psychiatric institution</a> of a mentally ill civil partner
(provided the parties are not separated and provided the applicant has not been
the subject of an application under the Domestic Violence Acts).</p>

<p><strong>Power of attorney: </strong>a civil partner must be informed of the
registration of an <a href="../../death/before_a_death/power_of_attorney.html">enduring power of
attorney</a>. Similarly, an enduring power of attorney in favour of a civil
partner ceases to be valid if the partnership is dissolved or there is a safety
or barring order against the civil partner.</p>

<p><strong>Property disputes: </strong>a civil partner may apply to the courts
for a decision in relation to disputes over property with his/her partner.</p>

<p><strong>Tenancies:</strong> Under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 a civil
partner may be able to take over a tenancy on the death of their partner. </p>

<h3>Former spouses who entered into civil partnerships</h3>

<p>Former spouses who entered into civil partnerships effectively lost their
status as former spouses. Under divorce legislation, former spouses continue to
have the right to apply to the courts for maintenance and property orders.
However, once they entered into a civil partnership, this changed. Maintenance
orders and pension adjustment orders in favour of a former spouse lapsed if
that spouse entered into a civil partnership. A property adjustment order may
not be made for the benefit of a former spouse if that spouse has registered in
a civil partnership.</p>

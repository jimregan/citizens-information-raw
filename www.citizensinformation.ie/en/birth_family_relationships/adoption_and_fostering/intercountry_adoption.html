<p>If you adopt a child who is living in a country outside Ireland, the process
is called intercountry adoption. Adopting a child who is resident in Ireland is
called a <a href="adopting_a_child.html">domestic adoption</a>.</p>

<p>Adoption is the process whereby a child becomes a member of a new family. It
creates a permanent, legal relationship between the adoptive parents and the
child.</p>

<p>As intercountry adoption is a complex legal process, it is helpful to be
aware of the basics of adoption law.</p>
<ul><li>An adoption order secures in law the position of the child in the
    adoptive family. The child is regarded in law as the child of the adoptive
    parents as if he/she were born to them. Legal adoption is permanent.</li>
  <li>Adoption orders are made by the <a href="http://www.aai.gov.ie/">Adoption
    Authority of Ireland</a>. It also has the power to recognise an adoption
    made outside the State. It was established in November 2010 under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0021/index.html">Adoption
    Act 2010</a>.</li>
  <li>The 2010 Act also ratified the <a href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&amp;cid=69">Convention
    on Protection of Children and Co-Operation in Respect of Intercountry
    Adoption (the ‘Hague Convention’)</a>. The only countries recognised by
    Ireland for intercountry adoption are those that have also ratified the
    Hague Convention. The Adoption Authority is the Irish Central Authority
    under the Convention.</li>
</ul><h3>Who can adopt?</h3>

<p>In order to adopt a child, you must be at least 21 years of age. You must be
ordinarily resident in the State and must have resided in the State for at
least one year before the date of the making of the adoption order.</p>

<p>The following persons are eligible to adopt:</p>
<ul><li>A married couple living together</li>
  <li>A married person alone. The other spouse's consent to adopt must be
    obtained unless the couple is living apart and separated under a court
    decree or a deed of separation, the other spouse has deserted the
    prospective adoptive parent or the other spouse's conduct has resulted in
    the prospective adoptive parent leaving them, with just cause.</li>
  <li>The mother, father or relative of the child (relative meaning a
    grandparent, brother, sister, uncle or aunt of the child and/or the spouse
    of any such person, the relationship to the child being traced through the
    mother or the father)</li>
  <li>A widow or widower</li>
  <li>A sole applicant who is not in one of the categories listed above may
    only adopt where the Adoption Authority is satisfied that, in the
    particular circumstances of the case, it is desirable. It is not possible
    for two unmarried persons to adopt jointly.</li>
</ul><p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2015/en/act/pub/0009/index.html">Children
and Family Relationships Act 2015</a> provides that civil partners and
cohabiting couples may jointly adopt a child. The relevant sections of the Act
have not yet come into effect. </p>

<p>There are no legal upper age limits for adopting parents. The Adoption
Authority has more <a href="http://aai.gov.ie/index.php/intercountry-adoption/introduction.html">information
on the eligibility and suitability of those wishing to adopt</a>.</p>

<h3>Assessment</h3>

<p>If you wish to adopt a child from another country, you are required to
undergo an assessment of your eligibility and suitability. This is carried out
by a social worker from the <a href="http://www.tusla.ie/services/alternative-care/adoption-services/intercountry-adoption/intercountry-adoption-offices/">Tusla
intercountry adoption service</a> or an accredited body. The social worker then
prepares an intercountry adoption assessment report (also called a home-study
report) which goes before the local adoption committee and a recommendation is
made.</p>

<h3>Declaration of eligibility and suitability</h3>

<p>Your application for assessment, the report and the local adoption
committee’s recommendations are sent to the Adoption Authority. If all
documents are in place and correct, and the recommendations are positive, the
Adoption Authority will grant a <a href="http://aai.gov.ie/index.php/intercountry-adoption/intercountry-adoption-process.html">declaration
of eligibility and suitability</a>.</p>

<p>The declaration may include in it a statement relating to the age or state
of health of a child whom you are considered suited to parent – this is based
on information provided in the assessment report.</p>

<p>The declaration is granted for a period of 2 years from the date it is
issued. The legislation allows for <a href="http://aai.gov.ie/adoption/intercountry/information-for-prospective-adopters-intercountry.html">a
1 year extension</a> if necessary, providing circumstances have not changed.</p>

<h3>Choosing a country of origin</h3>

<p>As part of the assessment process, you will have decided on a country from
which you wish to adopt a child. Under the Adoption Act 2010, Irish residents
can only adopt from other countries that have ratified the Hague Convention or
from Non-Hague countries with which Ireland has a bi-lateral agreement (Ireland
does not currently have any such agreements).</p>

<p>There is only a <a href="http://aai.gov.ie/index.php/intercountry-adoption/hague-country-advisories.html">small
number of Hague Convention countries</a> with which Ireland currently engages
for the purposes of intercountry adoption. Each country has its own
requirements and restrictions with regard to prospective adopters. Specific
information on country requirements may be obtained from the Irish agencies
accredited to facilitate adoptions from these countries.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>

<p>The process involved in intercountry adoption is governed by protocols set
out in the Hague Convention. Firstly, the Adoption Authority, or an agency
accredited by the Authority for such purposes, submits the intercountry
adoption assessment report and the declaration (together known as an Article 15
report) to the Central Authority or an accredited agency in the country you
wish to adopt from.</p>

<p>Matching a child with your application is done in the country of origin of
the child. When a match is made, the Central Authority or accredited body in
the country of origin of the child sends a child-study report (Article 16
report) to the Adoption Authority or the Irish-based accredited body. The
report will normally contain a background report on the child, the
birth-parents (if known), medical history of the child and proof that consents,
where applicable, were obtained in the required manner and format.</p>

<p>If the Adoption Authority is satisfied with the suitability of the match, it
issues a consent to the placement of the child with you (Article 17). You will
be informed and asked whether you wish to accept the child. If you wish, you
can travel to the country of origin to see the child before making your
decision. Either way, you can change your mind up to the time you adopt the
child.</p>

<h3>Adoption</h3>

<p>While most countries allow you to adopt the child in the country of origin,
there are some who may provide you with guardianship with a view to you
obtaining a <a href="adopting_a_child.html">domestic adoption</a> on your
return to Ireland.</p>

<p>Some countries provide guardianship with a requirement that you provide
post-placement reports for a prescribed period before finalising the adoption
in the courts of the country of origin.</p>

<h3>Immigration clearance</h3>

<p>For the child to enter the state, immigration clearance must be obtained
from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) in the Department
of Justice and Equality. To request your <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Foreign%20Adoption">Immigration
Clearance Letter</a>, you need to write to:</p>
<dl><dd>Foreign Adoption Unit,</dd>
    <dd>Residence Division,</dd>
    <dd>Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service,</dd>
    <dd>3rd Floor, 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2</dd>
    <dd>E-mail: <a href="mailto:INISfadopt@justice.ie">INISfadopt@justice.ie</a></dd>
</dl><p>You will need to enclose:</p>
<ul><li>A letter of application that includes a daytime contact number</li>
  <li>A photocopy of your passport (and your spouse's)</li>
  <li>Two passport size photographs of you (and two of your spouse)</li>
  <li>The Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability (not a copy)</li>
  <li>A letter from the Adoption Authority stating how many children you can
    adopt and from what country</li>
</ul><p>These will be returned to you with your Immigration Clearance Letter, when
approved. You will need to present this letter to an immigration officer when
you return to Ireland..</p>

<h3>Notification of Adoption Authority</h3>

<p>You must notify the Adoption Authority and Tusla when you bring the child to
Ireland for the first time after adoption in the country of origin. They must
also be notified if you bring the child to Ireland in order to <a href="http://aai.gov.ie/index.php/domestic-adoption/applying-for-an-adoption-order.html">adopt
the child here</a>.</p>

<p>This should be done as soon as you can and must be done within 3 months.</p>

<h3>Registering the adoption</h3>

<p>If the child was adopted in the country of origin, the final step in the
intercountry adoption process is the registration of the adoption. This is the
formal, legal recognition of the adoption by the Irish State.</p>

<p>You must submit an <a href="http://www.aai.gov.ie/index.php/intercountry-adoption/register-a-foreign-adoption.html">application
for registration of the adoption</a> to the Adoption Authority within 3 months
of re-entering the State, following the adoption. The Authority can register
the adoption in the Register of Intercountry Adoptions on the basis of an
Article 23 certificate<a href="http://aai.gov.ie/adoption/intercountry/information-for-prospective-adopters-intercountry.html"></a>.
(An Article 23 certificate is a certificate of assurance from the country of
origin of your child that the adoption was carried out in compliance with the
Hague Convention.)</p>

<p>The Register of Intercountry Adoptions contains details of the adopted child
and the adoptive parents and is a public document open to scrutiny by members
of the public. Certificates or copies of extracts from the Register may be
obtained from the Authority for the appropriate fee and serve for all legal
purposes as a birth certificate for your child.</p>

<h3>Post-adoption reports</h3>

<p>Some countries require that you provide information on the child’s ongoing
condition and progress following adoption. This information is usually provided
in reports known as post-adoption reports. These reports are normally compiled
by social workers or agencies accredited by the Adoption Authority to provide
such services.</p>

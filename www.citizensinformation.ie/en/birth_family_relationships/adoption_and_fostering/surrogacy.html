<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Surrogacy is a way for a childless couple or individual to have a child,
with a surrogate mother carrying the child. The surrogate mother agrees to be
artificially inseminated or to have an embryo transferred to her womb in order
to become pregnant. She then carries the child to term with the intention of
giving custody of the child to the person/couple (known as the commissioning
person/couple) with whom she has made the agreement.</p>

<p>Surrogacy can take place using any of the following:</p>
<ul><li>The commissioning mother’s ova and the commissioning father’s
  sperm</li>
  <li>The commissioning mother’s ova and donor sperm</li>
  <li>The surrogate mother’s ova and the commissioning father’s sperm</li>
  <li>The surrogate mother’s ova and donor sperm</li>
  <li>Donor ova and the commissioning father’s sperm</li>
  <li>Donor ova and sperm, or donor embryo</li>
</ul><p>Surrogacy arrangements can take place using artificial insemination (AI) or
in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques, but may also be carried out without
any medical intervention. The surrogacy arrangement may be entered into in
Ireland or abroad.</p>

<p>As the commissioning mother does not become pregnant, she is not entitled to
<a href="../../employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/maternity_leave.html">maternity
leave</a> or <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/maternity_benefit.html">Maternity
Benefit</a> if she is in employment.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l0f07b">Legal status</h2>

<p>There is no Irish legislation to cover the legal issues arising from
surrogacy. In the <a href="http://health.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Report-of-The-Commission-on-Assisted-Human-Reproduction.pdf">Report
of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction (2005) (pdf)</a>, the
Commission made a recommendation that a child born through surrogacy should be
presumed to be that of the commissioning couple. The Commission also
recommended the establishment of a regulatory body for assisted human
reproduction, including surrogacy. The recommendations have not yet been
incorporated into Irish law.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the surrogate mother is considered the legal mother of the
child and the child’s guardian, because she has given birth to the child.
Legal maternity is important for birth registration, domicile and citizenship
provisions, succession, childcare provisions, adoption, social welfare and
educational provisions as many of these services and rights depend on the
consent of the legal mother.</p>

<p>If the surrogate mother is married, then under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1987/en/act/pub/0026/sec0046.html#sec46">Section
46 of the Status of Children Act 1987</a>, the surrogate mother's husband is
presumed by law to be the father of the child, unless the contrary is proven.
If she is not married, she is the sole guardian.</p>

<h3>Adoption</h3>

<p>It would be necessary for the commissioning person(s) to <a href="adopting_a_child.html">adopt the child</a> in order to have a legal
relationship with it. If the child is being adopted, this must be done through
the Adoption Authority of Ireland, and there is no guarantee that the child of
a surrogate mother would be placed with the biological mother and/or father.
Private adoptions are not allowed, and the parent of a child is prohibited from
receiving any payment for giving away the child for adoption.</p>

<p>An adoptive mother (or a sole male adopter) is entitled to avail of <a href="../../employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/adoptive_leave.html">adoptive
leave</a> from employment. They may also be entitled to <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/adoptive_benefit.html">Adoptive
Benefit</a>.</p>

<h3>Guardianship and custody</h3>

<p>Alternatively, a commissioning man could apply for <a href="../cohabiting_couples/legal_guardianship_and_unmarried_couples.html">guardianship
of the child</a> under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 if he is the
genetic or biological father of the child. However, his partner would not have
any right to make such an application.</p>

<p>In relation to <a href="../cohabiting_couples/custody_of_children_and_unmarried_couples.html">custody
rights</a>, if the surrogate mother uses her own ova to conceive the child, it
is likely that an Irish court would hold her to be the legal mother, as she is
both the genetic and gestational mother. In the case of a surrogate mother who
carries an embryo generated from the commissioning couple’s ova and sperm,
the position is not as clear.</p>

<h3>Surrogacy arrangements abroad</h3>

<p>When surrogacy arrangements are entered into abroad, issues such as
citizenship and travel documents also arise. The Department of Justice and
Equality has published a document providing <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/20120221%20Guidance%20Document.pdf/Files/20120221%20Guidance%20Document.pdf">advice
on citizenship, parentage, guardianship and travel document issues</a> in
relation to children born as a result of surrogacy arrangements entered into
outside the State.</p>

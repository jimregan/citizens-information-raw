<p>Adoption is the process whereby a child becomes a member of a new family. It
creates a permanent, legal relationship between the adoptive parents and the
child.</p>

<p>Adopting a child who is resident in Ireland is called a domestic adoption.
If the child is living abroad, the process is called intercountry adoption.</p>

<p>An adoptive mother (or a man who is a sole adopter) is entitled to avail of
<a href="../../employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/adoptive_leave.html">adoptive
leave from employment</a>.</p>

<p>As adoption is a complex legal process, it is helpful to be aware of the
basics of adoption law.</p>
<ul><li><a href="../family_support_agency.html">Tusla - the Child and Family
    Agency</a> is the competent authority for the processing of domestic
    adoptions. Accredited bodies work with Tusla in all areas of adoption,
    undertaking those activities for which they are accredited.</li>
  <li>An adoption order secures in law the position of the child in the
    adoptive family. The child is regarded in law as the child of the adoptive
    parents as if he/she were born to them. Legal adoption is permanent.</li>
  <li>Adoption orders are made by the <a href="http://www.aai.gov.ie/">Adoption
    Authority of Ireland</a>. It was established in November 2010 under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0021/index.html">Adoption
    Act 2010</a>.</li>
  <li>The law allows the adoption of orphans and children born outside marriage
    (including, in certain circumstances, children whose natural parents
    subsequently marry each other). In exceptional cases, the High Court can
    authorise the adoption of children whose parents have failed in their duty
    of care towards them (this can include children born within marriage). See
    the <a href="http://www.tusla.ie/services/alternative-care/adoption-services/adoption/children-eligible-for-adoption/">Tusla
    website</a>.</li>
</ul><h3>Types of domestic adoption</h3>

<h4>Step-parent adoption</h4>

<p>A step-parent adoption occurs when a child is adopted by a married couple,
one of whom is the natural parent of the child (usually the mother) while the
other is not. Both the natural parent and the step-parent must adopt the child
in order to avoid the natural parent losing his/her rights and responsibilities
to the child. If a child was born within a previous marriage, where the natural
parent has now remarried following a divorce or the death of his/her spouse,
the child is not eligible for adoption.</p>

<h4>Extended family adoption</h4>

<p>An extended family adoption occurs where a member of the child’s family or
a relative adopts the child. The child would have been placed with them by the
birth mother or by the Tusla child care system.</p>

<h4>Domestic infant adoption</h4>

<p>Domestic infant adoption is where a child is placed with an alternative set
of parents. The child may only be placed with the couple by the Tusla adoption
service or registered adoption society. The Adoption Authority must approve the
placement before it takes place.</p>

<h4>Long term foster care adoption</h4>

<p>Foster care adoption occurs when a couple adopt a child who was originally
placed with them in a foster care situation.</p>

<p>There is <a href="http://aai.gov.ie/index.php/domestic-adoption/what-is-domestic-adoption.html">more
information on the different types of domestic adoption</a> on the Adoption
Authority’s website.</p>

<h3>Who can adopt?</h3>

<p>In order to adopt a child, you must be at least 21 years of age and resident
in the State. Where the child is being adopted by a married couple and one of
them is the mother or father or a relative of the child, only one of them must
have attained the age of 21 years.</p>

<p>The following persons are eligible to adopt:</p>
<ul><li>A married couple living together</li>
  <li>A married person alone. The other spouse's consent to adopt must be
    obtained unless the couple is living apart and separated under a court
    decree or a deed of separation, the other spouse has deserted the
    prospective adoptive parent or the other spouse's conduct has resulted in
    the prospective adoptive parent leaving them, with just cause.</li>
  <li>The mother, father or relative of the child (relative meaning a
    grandparent, brother, sister, uncle or aunt of the child and/or the spouse
    of any such person, the relationship to the child being traced through the
    mother or the father)</li>
  <li>A widow or widower</li>
  <li>A sole applicant who is not in one of the categories listed above may
    only adopt where the Adoption Authority is satisfied that, in the
    particular circumstances of the case, it is desirable. It is not possible
    for two unmarried persons to adopt jointly.</li>
</ul><p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2015/en/act/pub/0009/index.html">Children
and Family Relationships Act 2015</a> provides that civil partners and
cohabiting couples may jointly adopt a child. The relevant sections of the Act
have not yet come into effect. </p>

<p>There are no legal upper age limits for adopting parents. Tusla has <a href="http://www.tusla.ie/services/alternative-care/adoption-services/adoption/who-may-adopt/">more
information on who can adopt</a>.</p>

<h3>Consent</h3>

<p>The consent of the parents/guardians of the child to the adoption is a legal
requirement. If the child is born outside marriage and the father has no
guardianship rights, only the mother's consent is needed, but the father is
entitled to be consulted (if possible). However, the consent of the father is
required if he marries the mother after the birth of the child or he is
appointed guardian or is granted custody of the child by court order.</p>

<p>The mother, father (where he is guardian) or other legal guardian must give
an initial consent or agreement to the placing of a child for adoption by Tusla
or an approved adoption service. They must then give their consent to the
making of an adoption order. This consent may be withdrawn any time before the
making of the adoption order.</p>

<p>If the mother either refuses consent or withdraws consent already given, the
adopting parents may apply to the High Court for an order. If the court is
satisfied that it is in the best interests of the child, it will make an order
giving custody of the child to the adopting parents for a specified period and
authorising the Adoption Authority to dispense with the mother's consent to the
making of the adoption order.</p>

<p>If a mother changes her mind about adoption before the making of the
adoption order, but the adopting parents refuse to give up the child, she may
then institute legal proceedings to have custody of her child returned to
her.</p>

<h3>Birth Father Register</h3>

<p>A birth father, with no guardianship rights, is entitled to be consulted
about the adoption of his child. If you are concerned that your partner or
former partner intends placing your child for adoption without letting you
know, you can ask the Adoption Authority to notify you by <a href="http://aai.gov.ie/images/download/Form-F3-Natural-Father-Register-Form.pdf">recording
your details on the Birth Father Register</a>. You can do this even before your
child is born, if necessary. This register is checked against all applications
for adoption.</p>

<h3>Assessment</h3>

<p>Applicants being considered for adoption undergo a detailed assessment. The
assessment is carried out by an adoption society or Tusla social worker. It
includes a number of interviews and home visits. Where the application is in
respect of a married couple, there are both individual and joint interviews.</p>

<p>The social worker will discusses such areas as previous and/or current
relationships, motives for adopting, expectations of the child and the ability
to help a child to develop his/her knowledge and understanding of his/her
natural background. All applicants are required to undergo a medical
examination.</p>

<p>The social worker then prepares a report which goes before the local
adoption committee and a recommendation is made.</p>

<h3>Declaration of eligibility and suitability</h3>

<p>Your application for assessment, the report and the local adoption
committee’s recommendations are sent to the Adoption Authority. If all
documents are in place and correct, and the recommendations are positive, the
Adoption Authority grants a declaration of eligibility and suitability.</p>

<p>The declaration is granted for a period of 2 years from the date it is
issued. It may include in it a statement relating to the age or state of health
of a child whom you are considered suited to parent – this is based on
information provided in the assessment report.</p>

<h3>Adoption order</h3>

<p>The period of time between the granting of the declaration of eligibility
and suitability to the making of an adoption order differs from one case to
another depending on the type of adoption application being made and the
particular circumstances of the applicants and the child.</p>

<p>In the case of a step-parent adoption where the child is in situ, it is
expected that the application for the adoption order will progress during the
lifespan of the declaration of eligibility and suitability. Where it is a
domestic infant adoption, there is no guarantee that a couple will be matched
with a child during the lifetime of the declaration. Before making an adoption
order the Adoption Authority must be satisfied that the child is eligible to be
adopted.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="http://aai.gov.ie/index.php/domestic-adoption/declaration-of-eligibility-a-suitability.html">information
on the issues that may arise</a> after the declaration is issued on the
Authority’s website.</p>

<h3>Adoption hearing</h3>

<p>When the adoption order is finally being made, you go before the Board of
the Adoption Authority with the child and give sworn evidence as to your
identity and eligibility. You will have previously completed a form indicating
the name that you want on the adoption order for the child. This can be changed
at the adoption hearing but it is preferable for this to have been agreed on
before the date of the hearing.</p>

<p>Find out <a href="http://aai.gov.ie/index.php/domestic-adoption/applying-for-an-adoption-order.html">more
about the adoption hearing here</a>.</p>

<h3>Adoption certificate</h3>

<p>At the adoption hearing, you are given information on how to go about
getting a new birth certificate for the child. The new birth certificate
(adoption certificate) is normally be available through the Registrar General's
Office within 4 weeks. Although it is not an actual birth certificate, it has
the status of one for legal purposes. It gives the date of the adoption order
and the names and addresses of the adoptive parents and is similar in all
aspects to a birth certificate.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx">United
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> sets out the basic human
rights to which children everywhere are entitled. These include:</p>
<ul><li>The right to survival</li>
  <li>The right to the development of their full physical and mental
  potential</li>
  <li>The right to protection from influences that are harmful to their
    development</li>
  <li>The right to participation in family, cultural and social life</li>
</ul><p>The Convention protects these rights by setting minimum standards that
governments must meet in providing healthcare, education and legal and social
services to children in their countries.</p>

<p>The Convention entered into force in September 1990. Ireland ratified the
Convention in 1992.</p>

<p>In 2002, two Optional Protocols to the Convention came into force:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/OPSCCRC.aspx">Optional
    Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child
    pornography</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/OPACCRC.aspx">Optional
    Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict</a></li>
</ul><p>You can find a <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/UNrightsofchild/rights_leaflet1.pdf">child-friendly
leaflet on the Convention (pdf)</a> on the Department of Children and Youth
Affairs website.</p>

<h3>Committee on the Rights of the Child</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CRC/Pages/CRCIntro.aspx">Committee on
the Rights of the Child</a> is a United Nations (UN) body of 18 Independent
experts that monitors implementation of the Convention by the countries that
are party to it. It also monitors implementation of the two Optional
Protocols.</p>

<p>The countries are obliged to submit regular reports to the Committee on how
the rights are being implemented. They must submit an initial report two years
after acceding to the Convention and then periodic reports every five years.
The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and
recommendations to the country in the form of <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/UNrightsofchild/Concluding_Obs_by_UNCRC_on_Irelands_Second_Report.pdf">concluding
observations</a>. Ireland submitted its <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/publications/UNCRC_2013.pdf">most
recent report</a> in 2013.</p>

<h3>Third Optional Protocol</h3>

<p>An <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/source/signature/2012/CTC_4-11d.pdf">Optional
Protocol on a communications procedure (pdf)</a> came into effect in Ireland on
24 December 2014. The Protocol allows individual children, or those acting on
their behalf, to submit complaints regarding specific violations of their
rights under the Convention and its first two Optional Protocols directly to
the Committee on the Rights of the Child.</p>

<p>A decision by the Committee on a complaint is non-binding on a country. As a
party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Ireland is answerable to
the United Nations for its implementation of the Convention.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=6QkG1d%2fPPRiCAqhKb7yhsoUh3kKWW%2fFEO9BFOYe%2bppFa2V9WoU8FCcOoKo5pZ5AKe9uV6CYtJDqO0H2LA%2fJdRbseH5ZQHMTKtwU5gpXbW9P5Hp0cGQz%2ftJlNSIQCEXrS">rules
of the procedure</a> are available on the UN Human Rights website.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/international/20141215UNCRCBriefingNote.htm">more
information on the Protocol</a> on the Department of Children and Youth Affairs
website.</p>

<h3>Making a complaint</h3>

<p>A complaint may be submitted to the Committee by a child (or a group of
children) claiming to be a victim of a violation of the Convention and/or the
Optional Protocols. A complaint may also be submitted by their designated
representative, or by others acting on behalf of the alleged victim with their
consent. Where there is a concern that the victimâ€™s consent may be the result
of improper pressure or inducement, the Committee may request additional
information to ensure that the complaint is in the best interests of the
child.</p>

<p>A complaint may be submitted on behalf of the alleged victim without their
consent - in this case, the representative will have to justify submitting the
complaint.</p>

<p>The Committee will not accept a complaint if:</p>
<ul><li>It is anonymous</li>
  <li>It is not in writing</li>
  <li>It constitutes an abuse of the right of submission of such complaints or
    is incompatible with the provisions of the Convention and/or the Optional
    Protocols</li>
  <li>The same matter has already been examined by the Committee or has been or
    is being examined under another procedure of international investigation or
    settlement</li>
  <li>All available domestic remedies have not been exhausted unless the
    application of the remedies is unreasonably prolonged or unlikely to bring
    effective relief</li>
  <li>The complaint is manifestly ill-founded or not sufficiently
  substantiated</li>
  <li>The facts that are the subject of the complaint occurred prior to the
    entry into force of the third Protocol for the country concerned, unless
    those facts continued after that date</li>
  <li>The complaint is not submitted within one year after the exhaustion of
    domestic remedies, except in cases where it can be demonstrated that it was
    not possible to submit the communication within that time limit</li>
</ul></div>

Care Act 1991</a>, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Children
Act 2001</a> and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx">United

under the age of 18. Unless you are or were married, you cannot enter a legally
binding contract until you are aged 18, except for certain contracts such as
for apprenticeships or for necessities like food. What a child is allowed to do
is restricted by his/her age. This document provides information on such issues

<h3>Education system </h3>

<p>The Irish education system is made up of primary, second-level, third-level
and further education. Children can attend primary school from the age of 4. To
attend second-level they must be aged 12 on 1 January in the first school year
of attendance. </p>

<p>There is also an <a href="../../education/pre_school_education_and_childcare/early_childhood_care_and_education_scheme.html">Early
Childhood Care and Education Scheme</a> for children of pre-school age. To be
eligible for the scheme they must be at least 3 years of age.</p>

<h3>School Attendance</h3>

<p>Attendance at school (or receiving an education) is compulsory from the age
of 6 up to age 16 or until students have completed 3 years of second-level
education, whichever is the later. </p>

<p>There is no compulsory <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/pre_school_education_and_childcare/early_childhood_education.html">early
childhood education</a>. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.tusla.ie/">Tusla - the Child and Family
Agency -</a> is the national agency established to ensure that every child
attends school regularly, or otherwise receives an appropriate minimum
education. The Board: </p>
<ul><li>Monitors school attendance, and takes a range of measures where children
    do not attend school </li>
  <li>Maintains a register of children who are not attending a recognised
    school </li>
  <li>Maintains a register of children aged 16 and 17 who leave school early to
    take up employment and makes arrangements for their continuing education
    and training in consultation with providers and employers </li>
</ul><p>Parents and guardians have a legal obligation to ensure that their child
attends a school or otherwise receives an education. If Tusla considers that
the parents are failing in their obligation, it sends the parents a School
Attendance Notice warning and if the parents fail to comply, they may be
prosecuted. Further information is available in our document on <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/attendance_and_discipline_in_schools/school_attendance.html">school
attendance</a>. </p>

<p>The Board also intervenes in relation to proposed school expulsions. </p>

<h3>Working<a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/LocalGovernment/MotorTax/FileDownLoad,26107,en.xls"></a></h3>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0016/index.html">Protection
of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996</a> employers cannot employ children
under age 16 in regular full-time jobs. Children under age 14 cannot be
employed. Children aged 14 and 15 may be employed as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Doing light work during the school holidays – they must have at least
    21 days off work during this time </li>
  <li>As part of an approved work experience or educational programme where the
    work is not harmful to their health, safety or development </li>
  <li>In film, cultural, advertising work or sport under licences issued by the
    Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation </li>
</ul><p>Children aged 15 may do 8 hours a week light work in school term time. The
maximum working week for children outside school term time is 35 hours or up to
40 hours if they are on approved work experience. </p>

<p>The maximum working week for children aged 16 and 17 is 40 hours with a
maximum of 8 hours a day.</p>

<p>Further information is available in our documents, <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/starting_work_and_changing_job/young_people_at_work/hours_of_work_for_young_people.html">Hours

of young workers</a>. </p>

<h3>Minimum wage </h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0005/index.html">National
Minimum Wage Act 2000</a> provides that the minimum wage rate for an
experienced adult employee since January 2017 is €9.25 an hour, where an
experienced adult employee is an employee who has an employment of any kind in
any 2 years over the age of 18. An employee under age 18 is entitled to €6.48
per hour or 70% of the minimum wage. An employer can pay more. </p>

<p>An employee is entitled to 80% and 90% of the minimum wage respectively in
the first two years of employment over age 18.</p>

<p>You can find out more about the National Minimum Wage in our document, <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/pay_inc_min_wage.html">Minimum
rates of pay in Ireland</a>. </p>

<h3>Unemployment payments </h3>

<p>When working, you start paying <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social
insurance contributions</a> from 16 years of age. However, you cannot claim an
unemployment payment, such as <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker’s
Benefit</a> or <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s
Allowance</a>, until age 18. You must also meet other criteria in order to
qualify. </p>

<h3>Tax</h3>

<h3>Alcohol </h3>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2003/act/31/section/13/enacted/en/index.html">Intoxicating
Liquor Act 2003</a>, it is an offence to buy alcohol or for someone to buy it
for you, if you are under age 18. It is also an offence for you to drink
alcohol unless you are in a private residence and have your parents’ consent.
</p>

<p>It is an offence for you to be in an off-licence unless you are with a
parent or guardian. </p>

<p>Children are only allowed on licensed premises if they are with a parent or
guardian, but this provision carries certain restrictions. If accompanied by a
parent/guardian, a child may remain on the premises up to 9pm (10pm from May to
September) unless the licence holder feels this is harmful to the child's
health, safety and welfare. Children aged between 15-17 years may remain on the
premises after 9pm where they are attending a private function at which a
substantial meal is served. </p>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2008/en/act/pub/0017/sec0014.html">Intoxicating
Liquor Act 2008</a> the Gardaí have the power to seize alcohol in the
possession of a child under 18 years of age where the Gardaí have reasonable
cause to believe that the alcohol will be consumed by a child under 18 years in
a public place. </p>

Health (Tobacco) Act 2002</a> it is an offence to sell cigarettes or other
tobacco products to anyone under the age of 18.</p>

<p>If you are under 18 years of age, from January 2016 <a href="https://www.dcya.gov.ie/docs/17.12.2015_Reilly_&amp;_Varadkar_announce_start_date_for_smo/3675.htm">you

funfair from the age of 16. </p>

<h3>Films, videos and computer games </h3>

<p><strong>Films <br></strong>What films you can watch in the cinema depends on the film’s
classification. The film classifications currently in use are as follows: </p>
<ul><li>G: The film is suitable for everyone including children of school going
    age </li>
  <li>PG: While the film may be watched by unaccompanied children, parental
    guidance is recommended as to its suitability for children under 12 years
    of age </li>
  <li>12A: While the film is considered suitable only for children aged 12 or
    over, a child under age 12 may be admitted to see the film if he/she is
    accompanied by a parent or guardian </li>
  <li>15A: While the film is considered suitable only for children aged 15 or
    over, a child under age 15 may be admitted to see the film if he/she is
    accompanied by a parent or guardian </li>
  <li>16: The film is considered to be suitable for children aged 16 or over.
    Children under this age cannot be admitted to screenings </li>
  <li>18: The film is considered suitable for persons age 18 or over </li>
</ul><p>Further information is available in our document, <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/recreational_activities_in_ireland/censorship_in_ireland/censorship_of_films_in_ireland.html">Censorship
of films in Ireland</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Videos <br></strong>A similar classification system is used for renting or buying Videos
and DVDs: </p>
<ul><li>G: The video/DVD is suitable for viewers generally </li>
  <li>PG: The video/DVD is suitable for viewers generally, but parental
    guidance is recommended for children under 12 </li>
  <li>12: The video/DVD is suitable for people aged 12 or over </li>
  <li>15: The video/DVD is suitable for people aged 15 or over </li>
  <li>18: The video/DVD is suitable for persons age 18 or over </li>
</ul><p>Further information is available in our document, <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/recreational_activities_in_ireland/censorship_in_ireland/censorship_of_video_and_dvd_recordings_in_ireland.html">Censorship
of video and DVD recordings</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Computer games</strong> <br>
Ireland uses the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.pegi.info/en/index/">Pan-European Game Information (PEGI)</a>
age rating system for the classification of computer games. It is a voluntary
system that retailers selling computer games are expected to follow. The
classifications are as follows: </p>
<ul><li>3+: The game content is suitable for all age groups </li>
  <li>7+: The game content is suitable for children aged 7 or over </li>
  <li>12+: The game content is suitable for children aged 12 or over </li>
  <li>16+: The game content is suitable for children aged 16 or over </li>
  <li>18+: The game content is suitable for people aged 18 or over </li>
</ul><p>The age rating does not take into account the difficulty level or skills
required to play a game. </p>

<h3>Pet ownership </h3>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1986/en/act/pub/0032/index.html">Control
of Dogs Act 1986</a> you cannot keep a dog unless you have a dog licence for
it. A local authority does not issue a dog licence to anyone under 16 years of
age. </p>

<p>If you have your dog out in public you must keep it under control, such as
on a lead. Certain breeds of dog must be muzzled at all times in public. These
dogs must be led by someone over the age of 16 and kept on a strong chain or
lead that is no longer than 2 metres. </p>

<p>You do not require a licence to own other pets and there is no legislation
specifying a minimum age at which you can own a pet.</p>

<h3>Drones and model aircraft</h3>

<p>Drones and model aircraft weighing 1kg or more, and less than 25kg, must be
registered with the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA). When calculating the
weight, fuel is not included. However, any articles or equipment installed in
or attached to the aircraft at the start of its flight, including cargo, are
included.</p>

<p>You must be over 16 years of age to register a drone or model aircraft.
Drones and model aircraft operated by those under 16 years of age must be
registered by a parent or legal guardian. Information on registering is
available on the <a href="https://www.iaa.ie/general-aviation/drones">IAA
website</a>.</p>

<p>When operating a drone or model aircraft, you must never operate it:</p>
<ul><li>If it will be a hazard to another aircraft in flight</li>
  <li>Over a crowd of people</li>
  <li>Farther than 300 metres from you</li>
  <li>Within 120 metres of any person, vessel or structure not under your
    control</li>
  <li>Closer than 5 kilometres from an aerodrome</li>
  <li>In a negligent or reckless manner so as to endanger the life or property
    of others</li>
  <li>Over 120 metres above ground level</li>
  <li>Over urban areas</li>
  <li>In civil or military controlled airspace</li>
  <li>In restricted areas such as military installations and prisons</li>
  <li>Unless you have permission from the landowner for take-off and
  landing</li>
</ul><p>Unmanned aircraft of 25kg or more must be <a href="https://www.iaa.ie/general-aviation/aircraft-registration-leasing">registered
in a similar manner to manned aircraft</a>.</p>

<h3>Firearms</h3>

<p>You have to be aged 16 or over before you can apply for a firearms
certificate. You have to be aged 14 or over before you can apply for a firearms
training certificate. A firearms training certificate does not allow you to own
a firearm but it does allow you to possess a firearm while carrying and using
it under the supervision of the person who holds a firearm certificate for that
firearm and is over 18 years of age.</p>

<p>The requirement to have a firearm certificate also applies to crossbows,
spearguns and all airguns above a certain muzzle velocity (including paintball
markers).</p>

<h3>Knives</h3>

<p>There is no set minimum age at which you can own a knife. However, it is an
offence to have a knife in a public place without a good reason, such as for
work.</p>

<h3>Health services</h3>

<p>There is a range of services specifically for children and certain services
are provided free of charge even if their parents do not have a medical card.
These services are generally provided as part of <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/women_s_health/maternity_and_infant_welfare_services.html">maternity
and infant welfare services</a>, <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/children_s_health/health_services_for_preschool_children.html">health
services for preschool children </a>and <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/children_s_health/school_health_services.html">school health
services</a>. Children are also entitled to <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/children_s_health/immunisations_for_children.html">vaccination
and immunisation services</a> free of charge.</p>

<h3>Surgical procedures </h3>

<p>In general, parental consent is required for children to have medical and
surgical tests and procedures and to receive vaccinations and inoculations.
Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0026/sec0023.html#zza26y1997s23">Non-Fatal
Offences Against the Person Act 1997</a>, children aged 16 and over may
themselves give consent to surgical procedures. </p>

<h3>Body piercing and tattooing </h3>

<p>There is no legislation regulating body piercing and tattooing. As a result
there is no legal minimum age at which you can get a body piercing or tattoo.
</p>

<h3>Teeth whitening</h3>

<p>Under <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:283:0036:0038:en:PDF">Directive
2011/84/EU of 20 September 2011(pdf)</a> you must be aged 18 or over to have
your teeth whitened.</p>

<h3>Sunbeds</h3>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0012/index.html">Public
Health (Sunbeds) Act 2014</a> you must be aged 18 or over to use a sunbed.</p>

<h3>Giving blood </h3>

<p>You cannot become a blood donor until you are aged 18. </p>

<h3>Contraceptive services </h3>

<p>There is no set minimum age in Ireland at which <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/women_s_health/family_planning_services.html">contraceptive
advice and prescriptions</a> may be provided. The age of consent to sexual
activity is 17 and it may be a criminal offence to have sex with a person under
17 years of age. This means that providers of contraceptive services are
entitled to refuse to provide those services to people under 17. </p>

<h3>Sexual activity </h3>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2006/act/15/section/3/enacted/en/html#sec3">Section
3 of the Criminal Law (Sex Offences) Act 2006</a> as amended by <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2007/act/6/section/5/enacted/en/html#sec5">Section
5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Act 2007</a> it is a
criminal offence to engage or attempt to engage in a sexual act with a child
under 17 years of age. It is not a defence to show that the child consented to
the sexual act. However, the 2017 Act recognises the reality of under age,
consensual, peer relationships through the introduction of a ‘proximity of
age’ defence. Under this provision, a person charged with an offence of
engaging in a sexual act with a person between the ages of 15 and 17 years can
use consent as a defence if the person charged is younger or is less than two
years older. They must not be in authority over the child or be intimidatory or
exploitative. </p>

<p>The consent of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dppireland.ie/">Director
of Public Prosecutions</a> is required for any prosecution of a child under the
age of 17 years for this offence. A girl under the age of 17 who has sexual
intercourse may not be convicted of an offence on that ground alone. </p>

<p>It is an offence for a person in authority to engage or attempt to engage in
a sexual act with a child under 18 years of age.</p>

<h3>Recognition of preferred gender</h3>

<p>An application can be made for a <a href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/GRC1.aspx">gender recognition
certificate</a> on behalf of a child aged 16 years or over if a court order is
obtained that exempts the child from meeting the age requirement.</p>

<h3>Marriage</h3>

<p>If you are ordinarily resident in Ireland, the minimum age at which you can
marry is 18 years. This is the case even if you marry outside of Ireland. In
certain special circumstances, you may be able to get a Court Exemption Order
allowing a marriage to proceed even if one or both parties are under 18.
Parental consent is not required. </p>

<p>Further information is available in our documents on the legal requirements
for <a href="../getting_married/legal_prerequisites_for_marriage.html">marriage</a>.
</p>

<h3>Maintenance</h3>

<p>A parent is required to maintain a dependent child. A dependent child is a
child who:</p>
<ul><li>Is under 18 years old or </li>
  <li>Is over 18 and under 23 years old but is still in full-time education
  </li>
</ul><p>If a court decides that the parent of a dependent child has failed to
provide such maintenance for the child as is <em>proper in the
circumstances</em>, it may order that parent to make periodical maintenance
payments to support the child. The court may also order a parent to pay a lump
sum. </p>

<p>Further information is available in our documents, <a shape="rect" href="../separation_and_divorce/maintenance_orders_and_agreements.html">Maintenance
orders and agreements</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../parenting_alone/maintenance_and_unmarried_couples.html">Maintenance
and unmarried couples</a>. </p>

<h3>Leaving home </h3>

<p>You can leave home at age 16, provided you have your parents’ consent. No
consent is required at age 18. </p>

<p>If you leave home before you are 18 without your parents’ consent and you
are considered to be homeless or at risk, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.tusla.ie/">Tusla</a> may be asked to intervene. Information on
the powers available to Tusla is available in our document, <a shape="rect" href="../services_and_supports_for_children/children_in_care.html">Children in
care</a>. </p>

<h3>Tracing natural parents </h3>

<p>If you have been adopted and wish to trace your natural parents, you can
have your details entered in the Adoption Authority’s <a shape="rect" href="http://www.aai.gov.ie/index.php/tracing/contact-preference-register.html">National
Adoption Contact Preference Register</a> which facilitates contact between
adopted people and their natural families. However, you must be 18 years of age
or over. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lbb521">Legal Rights</h2>

<h3>Criminal responsibility</h3>

<p>The age of criminal responsibility is 12 years of age. This means that
children who have not reached the age of 12 cannot be charged with an offence.
There is an exception, however, for children aged 10 or 11, who can be charged
with murder, manslaughter, rape or aggravated sexual assault. </p>

<p>Where a child under 14 years of age is charged with an offence, no further
proceedings can be taken without the consent of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dppireland.ie/">Director of Public Prosecutions</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Children under 12 <br></strong>Where the Gardaí have reasonable grounds for believing that a child
under 12 years of age has committed an offence with which the child cannot be
charged due to his/her age, the Gardaí must take the child to his/her parents
or guardian. Where this is not possible, the Gardaí will arrange for the child
to be taken into the custody of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.tusla.ie/">Child and Family Agency (Tusla)</a> services for
the area in which the child normally resides. It is possible that children
under 12 years of age who commit criminal offences will be dealt with by Tusla
and not the criminal justice system. Information on the powers available to
Tusla is available in our document, <a shape="rect" href="../services_and_supports_for_children/children_in_care.html">Children in
care</a>. </p>

<h3>Detention in a Garda station</h3>

<p>When a child is <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/children_and_young_offenders/treatment_of_child_suspects_in_garda_custody.html">detained
in a Garda station</a> it is the duty of the Garda in charge of the station to
ensure that, as far as possible, the child is not allowed meet with or
associate with adult suspects being detained in the station at the same time. A
child may not be interviewed in a Garda station except in the presence of
his/her parent or guardian. It may be permitted where there are very special
circumstances, for example, where a delay in questioning would involve a risk
of death or injury. </p>

<h3>Children Court</h3>

<p>Children being charged with a crime are dealt with by the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/children_court.html">Children Court</a>. The court
can impose a period of detention on a child. Where the child is under 16 years
of age the child is detained in a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.iyjs.ie/en/IYJS/Pages/WP08000052">children detention
school</a> which are managed by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.iyjs.ie/en/IYJS/Pages/Home">Irish Youth Justice Service</a>.
Children aged 16 and 17 are detained in a <a href="http://www.iyjs.ie/en/IYJS/Pages/WP08000052#Development_of_a_National_Children_Detention_Facility">child
detention centre</a>. However, the court can only impose a detention order
where it is satisfied that it is the only suitable way to deal with the child
and, for a child under 16 years of age, that a place in a children detention
school is available.</p>

<p>Apart from detention there are also diversion programmes and community
sanctions available to the court. </p>

<p>There is more information on children and the criminal justice system in our
section on <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/children_and_young_offenders/">children and young
offenders</a>.</p>

<h3>Elections</h3>

<p>In order to vote in an <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/elections_and_referenda/">election or
referendum</a> in Ireland, you must be <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/elections_and_referenda/voting/registering_to_vote.html">registered
to vote</a>. To be eligible to be included on the Register of Electors, you
must be at least 18 years old on the day the Register comes into force (15
February). </p>

<p>You are eligible for inclusion in the supplement to the Register of Electors
on or after the day on which you reach 18 years of age. You can be included in
the supplement if this birthday falls after the closing date for applications
for the supplement but is on or before polling day. If you are within this
category, you should submit your application with a copy of your <a shape="rect" href="../after_your_baby_is_born/registering_birth_your_baby.html">birth
certificate</a>. </p>

<p>You cannot stand as a candidate in an election until you are at least 18
years of age. You must be:</p>
<ul><li>Age 18 for local elections </li>
  <li>Age 21 for national and European elections </li>
  <li>Age 35 for presidential elections </li>
</ul><h3>Contracts</h3>

<p>Unless you are or were married, you cannot enter a legally binding contract
until you are aged 18. The exception to this is <em>contracts for
necessaries</em> and <em>beneficial contracts of service</em> which are in your
best interests. <em>Contracts for necessaries</em> usually include contracts
for food, clothing and lodging, but may also cover contracts for items
connected with education and training such as school books and training
uniforms. </p>

<p>Beneficial contracts of service usually involve contracts for
apprenticeships or contracts with agents or managers. These contracts of
service are only enforceable if they are to your advantage and in your best
interests. </p>

<h3>Bank accounts</h3>

<p>Accounts for children of primary school age are usually simple, easy to use
savings or deposit accounts that pay interest and have no charges. You can open
them with a very small amount of money. </p>

<p>Accounts for secondary school students usually offer ATM cards, but you have
to keep the account in credit at all times. They do not offer an overdraft
facility and there is a limit to how much you can withdraw. Usually you do not
have to pay fees and charges. </p>

<p>You cannot open a standard current account until you are aged 18. </p>

<p>When opening an account each provider has different procedures. Some
providers require that a parent or guardian sign the account opening form if
you are under 16 years of age. Other providers only require parental permission
if you are under 13 years of age. </p>

<p>More information is available in our document, <a shape="rect" href="../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/financial_institutions/opening_and_switching_a_bank_account.html">Opening
and switching a bank account</a>. </p>

<h3>Jury service</h3>

<p>You cannot <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courtroom/jury_service.html">sit
on a jury in a court</a> until you are aged 18. Your name must be on the
Register of Electors for the Dáil. </p>

<h3>Making a will</h3>

<p>You cannot <a shape="rect" href="/en/death/before_a_death/making_a_will.html">make a will</a> until you are
aged 18 unless you are or have been married. </p>

<h3>Changing your name</h3>

<p>The surname of a child can be changed in the <a shape="rect" href="../after_your_baby_is_born/registering_birth_your_baby.html">Register of
Births</a> but only in certain circumstances. However, the surname of a child
can also be changed by deed poll or common usage. </p>

<p>Children aged between 14 and 17 years can execute the Deed Poll themselves
but need the consent of both parents. Where a child is under the age of 14
years, one of the child's parents must execute the Deed Poll with the consent
of the other parent. </p>

<p>You can <a shape="rect" href="../problems_in_marriages_and_relationships/changing_your_name_by_deed_poll.html">change
your name by deed poll</a> without consent when you are aged 18 or over. </p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.omc.gov.ie/documents/Aboutus/stratfullenglishversion.pdf">National
Children's Strategy (Our Children - their Lives)</a> was a 10-year plan which
was published by the Government in 2000. It was the blueprint for improving the
lives of children. It had 3 main goals:</p>
<ul><li>Children would have a voice in matters which affect them and their views
    would be given due weight in accordance with their age and maturity. </li>
  <li>Children's lives would be better understood; their lives would benefit
    from evaluation, research and information on their needs, rights and the
    effectiveness of services. </li>
  <li>Children would receive quality supports and services to promote all
    aspects of their development. </li>
</ul><p>The National Children's Office had overall responsibility for co-ordinating
the implementation of the strategy. In 2005 the National Children's Office
became part of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p>

<h3>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</h3>

<p>The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (OMCYA) was set up
in December 2005 to bring greater coherence to policy-making for children and
played a key role in supporting the implementation of the National Children's
Strategy. It was part of the Department of Health and Children but had units
from the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Education and
Skills co-located with it.</p>

<p>In June 2011, the <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2FAboutus%2Fintro.htm&amp;mn=abor&amp;nID=1">Department
of Children and Youth Affairs</a> was established, with the Minister for
Children and Youth Affairs becoming a full cabinet minister. Certain units from
other departments also became part of the new Department.</p>

<h3>National Children's Strategy Implementation Group</h3>

<p>As part of the 10-year social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, the
Government gave a commitment to establishing a high-level group, which would
draw together all those government departments and State agencies which develop
policies and deliver services that affect the lives of children and young
people. </p>

<p>The National Children's Strategy Implementation Group (NCSIG) was
established in 2006. Its membership was drawn from the relevant Government
Departments, the <a href="../family_support_agency.html">Child and Family
Agency</a>, representatives of local authorities, the education sector and
other key agencies. </p>

<p>The key priority of the NCSIG was to ensure implementation of all the
strategic plans and policy documents which had already been drawn up and
published in relation to children's services in Ireland. As part of the process
of achieving its goals, the NCSIG was committed to establishing a network of
Children and Young People's Services Committees. </p>

<h3>Children and Young People’s Services Committees</h3>

<p>All major organisations and agencies working locally on behalf of children
and young people are represented on <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=1394&amp;mn=chip&amp;nID=6">Children
and Young People’s Services Committees (CYPSC)</a>. The CYPSCs are
responsible for improving the lives of children and families at local and
community level, through integrated planning, working and service delivery.
They ensure that professionals and agencies work together so that children and
families receive services that are better and more accessible. There is more
information on the <a href="http://www.cypsc.ie/">CYPSC website</a>. </p>

<h3>Agenda for Children's Services</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/publications/CS_handbook%5BENGLISH%5Dlowres.pdf">Agenda
for Children's Services (pdf)</a> was published in 2007 by the Office of the
Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. It sets out the strategic direction
and key goals of public policy in relation to children's health and social
services. It draws together the various types of outcomes found in contemporary
children's policy and presents them as a single list of 7 National Service
Outcomes for Children in Ireland. These are:</p>
<ul><li>Healthy, both physically and mentally</li>
  <li>Supported in active learning</li>
  <li>Safe from accidental and intentional harm</li>
  <li>Economically secure</li>
  <li>Secure in the immediate and wider physical environment</li>
  <li>Part of positive networks of family, friends, neighbours and the
  community</li>
  <li>Included and participating in society</li>
</ul><p>This provides a single framework for the relevant government departments and
agencies in all policy considerations and services related to children and
families.</p>

<h3>Working Together for Children initiative</h3>

<p>The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the National Children's
Strategy Implementation Group and the Children's Services Committees have been
leading an initiative to develop a planning model for national and local
interagency working to improve outcomes for children. This is collectively
known as the <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/policy/Working_Together_for_Children.pdf">Working
Together for Children (pdf)</a> initiative. The objective of the initiative is
to secure better developmental outcomes for children through more effective
integration of policies and services. In April 2011 a <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/publications/Final-Governance-Framework-April-2011.doc">Governance
Framework for the Working Together for Children Initiative</a> was published.
</p>

<p>The Department of Children and Youth Affairs provides leadership for this
initiative at national level and the Child and Family Agency provides
leadership at local level. </p>

<h3>Children and Young People’s Policy Framework</h3>

<p>In April 2014 the Department of Children and Youth Affairs published <a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=3146&amp;ad=1&amp;nID=1">Better
Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and
Young People 2014 -2020</a>. It is the first national policy framework for
children and young people aged from birth to 24 years. It establishes a shared
set of outcomes for children and young people towards which all government
departments, agencies, statutory services and the voluntary and community
sectors work. These outcomes are:</p>
<ul><li>Active and healthy, with positive physical and mental wellbeing</li>
  <li>Achieving their full potential in all areas of learning and
  development</li>
  <li>Safe and protected from harm</li>
  <li>Economic security and opportunity</li>
  <li>Connected, respected and contributing to their world </li>
</ul><p>It provides the framework for the development and implementation of policy
and services for children and young people.</p>

<h3>National Youth Strategy 2015-2020</h3>

<p>In October 2015 the Department of Children and Youth Affairs published the
<a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/publications/20151008NatYouthStrat2015to2020.pdf">National
Youth Strategy 2015-2020</a>. It sets out the Government’s aim and objectives
for young people, aged 10 to 24 years, so that they can achieve the outcomes
set out in the Policy Framework.</p>

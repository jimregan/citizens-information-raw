<p>The Department of Children and Youth Affairs was established in 2011 and
brings together a number of key areas of policy and provision for children,
young people and families. It focuses on policy issues that affect children in
areas such as early childhood care and education, youth justice, child welfare
and protection, children and young people's participation, research on children
and young people and youth work. It has developed a national policy framework
for children and young people. A national strategy on participation in
decision-making and a youth strategy were developed to develop on specific
parts of the national policy framework.</p>

<h3>National Policy Framework</h3>

<p>In April 2014 the Department of Children and Youth Affairs published <a href="https://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/cypp_framework/BetterOutcomesBetterFutureReport.pdf" name="Better1" id="Better1">Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National
Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014–2020 (pdf)</a>. It is the
first national policy framework for children and young people aged from birth
to 24 years. It establishes a shared set of outcomes for children and young
people towards which all government departments, agencies, statutory services
and the voluntary and community sectors work. These outcomes are to:</p>
<ul><li>Be active and healthy, with positive physical and mental wellbeing</li>
  <li>Achieve their full potential in all areas of learning and development</li>
  <li>Be safe and protected from harm</li>
  <li>Have economic security and opportunity</li>
  <li>Be connected, respected and contributing to their world </li>
</ul><p>It provides the framework for the development and implementation of policy
and services for children and young people.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>National Strategy for Research and Data on Children’s Lives</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/publications/NSRD_main-report.pdf">National
Strategy for Research and Data on Children’s Lives 2011–2016 (pdf)</a>
recognises that good information is essential in helping us understand both how
children and young people are developing and how policies and services impact
on their lives. The strategy sets out a plan for research and data on
children’s lives in Ireland over the period 2011–2016 and after that.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>National Strategy on Children and Young People's Participation in
Decision-making</h3>

<p>In June 2015 the <a href="https://www.dcya.gov.ie/docs/national-strategy-on-children-and-young-people-s-participation-in-decision-making/3456.htm">National
Strategy on Children and Young People's Participation in Decision-making
(2015–2020)</a> was launched. It identifies the following objectives and
priority areas for action:</p>
<ul><li>Children and young people will have a voice in decisions made in their
    local communities</li>
  <li>Children and young people will have a voice in decision-making in early
    education, schools and the wider formal and non-formal education
  systems</li>
  <li>Children and young people will have a voice in decisions that affect
    their health and well-being, including on the health and social services
    delivered to them</li>
  <li>Children and young people will have a voice in the Courts and legal
  system</li>
  <li>Promoting effective leadership to champion and promote participation of
    children and young people</li>
  <li>Development of education and training for professionals working with and
    on behalf of children and young people</li>
  <li>Mainstreaming the participation of children and young people in the
    development of policy, legislation and research</li>
</ul><h3>National Youth Strategy 2015–2020</h3>

<p>In October 2015 the Department of Children and Youth Affairs published the
<a href="http://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/publications/20151008NatYouthStrat2015to2020.pdf">National
Youth Strategy 2015–2020 (pdf)</a> which builds on the National Policy
Framework – Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures. It sets out the Government’s
aim and objectives for young people, aged 10 to 24 years, so that they can
achieve the outcomes set out in the policy framework.</p>

<h3><br>
Children and Young People’s Services Committees </h3>

<p>All major organisations and agencies working locally on behalf of children
and young people are represented on Children and Young People’s Services
Committees (CYPSC). The CYPSCs are responsible for improving the lives of
children and families at local and community level, through integrated
planning, working and service delivery. They ensure that professionals and
agencies work together so that children and families receive services that are
better and more accessible. There is more information on the <a href="http://www.cypsc.ie/">CYPSC website</a>. <br></p>

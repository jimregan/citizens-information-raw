<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p>Having a baby or becoming a parent through birth, adoption or fostering is
an exciting time and a major event in life. Family life in Ireland has changed
significantly in the past few years and there are now many different types of
parents and many different types of families.</p>

<p>If you live in Ireland and will beome a parent through birth, your first
step after discovering the pregnancy should be to visit your family doctor
(GP). Your doctor will confirm your pregnancy and you will receive important
advice about your options and the health services available to you. If this is
an unplanned pregnancy, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.positiveoptions.ie">Positive Options</a> register will provide
information on the wide range of agencies and groups offering free
non-directional support and counselling services. </p>

<p>If you or your partner will be giving birth in Ireland, you may avail of the
<a shape="rect" href="/en/health/women_s_health/maternity_and_infant_welfare_services.html">Maternity
and Infant Care Scheme</a>, provided as part of the public health service.
Here, the woman registers with a <a shape="rect" href="../health/gp_and_hospital_services/">family doctor (GP)</a>, who will
monitor her pregnancy throughout the term and refer her to a hospital for
specialised checks. Most women in Ireland choose to give birth in hospital, but
there are other options available, including <a shape="rect" href="before_your_baby_is_born/home_birth.html">home birth</a>. The infant
mortality rate in Ireland is one of the lowest in the world and maternity
healthcare is of a very high standard. </p>

<p>If you will become a parent through <a shape="rect" href="adoption_and_fostering/adopting_a_child.html">adoption</a> or <a shape="rect" href="adoption_and_fostering/fostering.html">fostering</a>, you
may like to read more detailed information on these topics here. </p>

<p>If you are an unmarried parent or will be parenting alone, you should read
through our information on <a shape="rect" href="unmarried_couples/custody_of_children_and_unmarried_couples.html">custody</a>,
<a shape="rect" href="unmarried_couples/access_to_children_and_unmarried_couples.html">access</a>,
<a shape="rect" href="unmarried_couples/inheritance_rights_and_unmarried_couples.html">inheritance</a>
and <a shape="rect" href="parenting_alone/maintenance_and_unmarried_couples.html">maintenance</a>.
You may also have an interest in the issue of <a shape="rect" href="unmarried_couples/legal_guardianship_and_unmarried_couples.html">legal
guardianship</a>. </p>

<h3>Becoming a parent and employment</h3>

<p>The law in Ireland provides specific protection for pregnant employees. You
are entitled to a period of <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/maternity_leave.html">maternity
leave</a> from employment. You may also be entitled to <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/maternity_benefit.html">Maternity
Benefit</a>. In addition you are entitled to paid time-off work to attend any
medical visits associated with the pregnancy and to attend a certain number of
<a shape="rect" href="before_your_baby_is_born/antenatal_visits.html">ante-natal classes</a>.
Both parents are also entitled to <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/parental_leave.html">parental
leave</a>. <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child
Benefit</a> is also payable to either parent (usually the mother) following the
birth. </p>

<p>If you have become a parent through adoption, you are entitled to a period
of <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/adoptive_leave.html">adoptive
leave</a> from employment. If you have enough PRSI contributions you may
qualify for <a href="../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/adoptive_benefit.html">Adoptive
Benefit</a>.</p>

<p>New entitlements to <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/paternity_leave.html">paternity
leave</a> and <a href="../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/paternity_benefit.html">Paternity
Benefit</a> are available in respect of children who are born or adopted from 1
September 2016 onwards.</p>

<p>If you have experienced a <a shape="rect" href="miscarriage_and_stillbirth/bereavement_and_childbirth.html">miscarriage
or bereavement</a> following the birth of your child, there are a number of
voluntary and community agencies throughout Ireland that offer assistance and
support. Women in Ireland who have experienced a stillbirth are entitled to
full <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/maternity_leave.html">maternity
leave</a> from employment.</p>

<h3>Birth registration</h3>

<p>After your child has been born, <a shape="rect" href="after_your_baby_is_born/registering_birth_your_baby.html">you must
register his/her birth</a> within 3 months of the date of birth. <a shape="rect" href="miscarriage_and_stillbirth/registering_stillbirth.html">Parents that have
experienced a stillbirth can also register the birth</a>. Registration may take
place in the office of any <a shape="rect" href="registrar_birth_marr_death.html">Registrar of Births, Marriages and
Deaths</a>. </p>

<p>The law in Ireland makes <a shape="rect" href="separation_and_divorce/presumption_of_paternity.html">presumptions about
the paternity</a> of children born to married couples. This means the husband
is presumed by law to be the father of the child. The husband's name will be
recorded on the birth certificate and he will acquire automatic guardianship of
that child unless the mother states otherwise. Unmarried fathers are not
automatical guardians of their own children and do not have an automatic right
to have their names included on their children's birth certificates. Read about
<a shape="rect" href="unmarried_couples/legal_guardianship_and_unmarried_couples.html">guardianship
for unmarried fathers here</a>. </p>

<p>The public health service incorporates care for women and children following
a birth in Ireland. This includes the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme, the <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/care_in_your_community/public_health_nurses.html">public health
nursing</a> service, <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/children_s_health/immunisations_for_children.html">vaccinations
and immunisations</a>. </p>

<p>The social welfare system also provides assistance through the various
channels including <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/health_safety_benefit.html">Health
and Safety Benefit</a>, <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent
Family Payment</a>, etc. </p>

<h3>Child Care</h3>

<p>Choosing the right care for your child can be a difficult decision. There is
a wide range of options including day nurseries, childminders, paygroups, etc.
Your choice will depend on what your needs are. In January 2010 an <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/pre_school_education_and_childcare/early_childhood_care_and_education_scheme.html">Early
Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme</a> was introduced which aims to
provide a free year of early childhood care and education for children of
pre-school age.</p>

<p>Since 1997, nurseries, playgroups and cr√®ches providing day care for
children under 6 years in Ireland have to meet certain regulations. Read about
the <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/pre_school_education_and_childcare/health_safety_and_welfare_of_preschool_childcare_services.html">regulation
of pre-school childcare places in Ireland here</a>. </p>

<p>Registered childcare providers must be notified to the <a shape="rect" href="family_support_agency.html">Child and Family Agency</a> and inspected
by it. The childcare facility must be registered with either the National
Childminding Association of Ireland or the National Children's Nurseries
Association. County Childcare Committees have been assigned to advance the
provision of child care services within your area. Check with <a shape="rect" href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">your
local authority</a> for more information on your local Committee. </p>

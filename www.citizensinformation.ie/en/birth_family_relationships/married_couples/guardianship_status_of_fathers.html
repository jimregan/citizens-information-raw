<h2>Information</h2>

<p>All mothers, irrespective of whether they are married or unmarried, have
automatic guardianship status in relation to their children, unless they give
the child up for <a shape="rect" href="../adoption_and_fostering/adopting_a_child.html">adoption</a>. A father
who is married to the mother of his child also has automatic guardianship
rights in relation to that child. This applies even if the couple married after
the birth of the child. </p>

<p>The rights of parents to guardianship are set down in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1964_0007.htm#SEC6">Section
6</a> of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1964_0007.htm">Guardianship
of Infants Act 1964</a> as amended. Guardianship rights entitle a parent to
make important decisions regarding that child's upbringing, for example,
deciding on the child's religion, education, medical treatment and where he/she
lives. </p>

<p>A father who is not married to the mother of his child does not have
automatic guardianship rights in relation to that child. If the mother agrees
for him to be legally appointed guardian, they must sign a joint statutory
declaration. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/si/0005.html">statutory
declaration (SI 5/1998)</a> must be signed in the presence of a <a shape="rect" href="../../../justice/civil_law/peace_commissioners.html">Peace
Commissioner</a> or a <a shape="rect" href="../../../justice/civil_law/commissioners_for_oaths.html">Commissioner for
Oaths</a>. If there is more than one child, a separate statutory declaration
should be made for each.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2015/en/act/pub/0009/index.html">Children
and Family Relationships Act 2015</a> provided for a number of <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR16000018">changes to the
Guardianship of Infants Act 1964</a>. For example, an unmarried father will
automatically be a guardian if he has lived with the child's mother for 12
consecutive months after 18 January 2016, including at least 3 months with the
mother and child following the child's birth. If there is disagreement as to
whether they have been cohabiting for the required length of time, an <a href="http://www.courts.ie/Courts.ie/Library3.nsf/PageCurrent/208FE8290DDDD0A080257FB500413B16?opendocument&amp;l=en#forms">application
for the necessary declaration</a> can be made to the court. </p>

<h3>Applying to the court for guardianship</h3>

<p>If the mother does not agree for the father to have guardianship, he may <a href="http://www.courts.ie/Courts.ie/Library3.nsf/PageCurrent/208FE8290DDDD0A080257FB500413B16?opendocument&amp;l=en">apply
for guardianship to the District Court</a>.</p>

<p>As well as fathers, certain other people may apply to the court for
guardianship:</p>
<ul><li>A step-parent, a civil partner or a person who has cohabited with a
    parent for not less than 3 years may apply to the court to become a
    guardian where they have co-parented the child for more than 2 years.</li>
  <li>A person who has provided for the childâ€™s day-to-day care for a
    continuous period of more than a year may apply for guardianship if the
    child has no parent or guardian who is willing or able to exercise the
    rights and responsibilities of guardianship.</li>
</ul><p>Also a parent can nominate a temporary guardian who can be appointed by the
court if the parent is suffering from a serious illness or injury which
prevents them from exercising their guardianship responsibilities in respect of
their child.</p>

<p>A father appointed as guardian by the court may be removed as guardian at a
future date whereas a father married to the mother of the child is normally
guardian for life.</p>

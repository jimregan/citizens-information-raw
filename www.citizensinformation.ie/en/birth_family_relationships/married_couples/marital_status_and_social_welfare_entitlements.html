<p>For the purposes of most social welfare claims in Ireland (for example, <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
Allowance</a>) and <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">supplementary
welfare allowance</a> claims, unmarried couples who are living together are
treated in the same way as married couples (or civil partners). </p>

<p>Your marital status will affect your entitlement to <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/death_related_benefits/widows_non_contrib_pen.html">Widow's/Widower's
or Surviving Civil Partner's Pension</a>.</p>

<p>You can only claim Widow's/Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Pension if
your spouse or civil partner dies. You will not be entitled to this pension if
you re-marry or enter into a new civil partnership.</p>

<p>If you are in doubt about how your marital status will affect your claim,
you should contact <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/ContactUs/Pages/localoffice.aspx">your local
social welfare office</a>. In the case of supplementary welfare allowance, you
should contact the Department of Social Protection's representative (fomerly
known as the Community Welfare Officer) in <a href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/otheroffice/community-welfare-office-contact.aspx">your
local office</a>.</p>

<p>Your civil status affects your rights to inherit from your spouse/partner.
Spouses and civil partners have the same legal right to inherit and the same
rights on intestacy. A will is automatically revoked when you marry unless it
was made in contemplation of that marriage. A bequest in a will to a person who
is a witness to the will or to that personâ€™s spouse is void. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you are not married, you may only inherit from your partner if you are
left a bequest in a valid will. However, a spouse is entitled to what is called
a "legal right share" of their deceased spouse's estate even if:</p>
<ul><li>there is no will</li>
  <li>the will is invalid</li>
  <li>there is a valid will, but it leaves little or nothing to the surviving
    spouse.</li>
</ul><p>The marital status of the deceased person may also indirectly affect the
inheritance rights of his/her children. </p>

<h3>Spousal inheritance rights</h3>

<p>The amount of the surviving spouse's legal right share depends on two
factors:</p>
<ul><li>whether or not there is a valid will</li>
  <li>whether or not the deceased spouse has any children.</li>
</ul><p>You are entitled to the whole estate if:</p>
<ul><li>there is no will or the will is invalid, and</li>
  <li>the deceased spouse has no children or grandchildren.</li>
</ul><p>You are entitled to two-thirds of the estate if:</p>
<ul><li>there is no valid will, and</li>
  <li>the deceased spouse has children or grandchildren. </li>
</ul><p>You are entitled to one-half of the estate if:</p>
<ul><li>there is a valid will, and</li>
  <li>the deceased spouse has no children or grandchildren.</li>
</ul><p>You are entitled to one-third of the estate if:</p>
<ul><li>there is a valid will, and</li>
  <li>the deceased spouse has children or grandchildren.</li>
</ul><p>If you are the surviving spouse, you must be informed of this right and
should apply for your legal right share as soon as possible. You may require
that the family home be given to you in satisfaction of your legal right share,
even if the home was left to another person under the will. If the family home
is worth more than the legal right share, you will normally have to pay the
difference into the deceased's estate. However, in cases of hardship, you may
apply to the court to have the dwelling house given to you either without
paying the difference or by paying such sum as the court thinks reasonable.</p>

<h3>Children's inheritance rights</h3>

<p>Both marital and non-marital children have equal rights to inherit from
their parents. However, non-marital children may have the additional burden of
having to prove paternity if it is disputed. Children's inheritance rights
<span>may</span> be affected by their deceased parent's marital status.</p>

<p>The children (minor and adult) are entitled to the <span>entire</span>
estate divided equally between them if:</p>
<ul><li>there is no will or the will is invalid, and</li>
  <li>the deceased parent <span>is not</span> married or his/her spouse is
    already dead.</li>
</ul><p>But the children are only entitled to <span>one-third</span> of the estate
divided equally between them if:</p>
<ul><li>there is no valid will or the will is invalid, and</li>
  <li>the deceased parent <span>is</span> married and is survived by his/her
    spouse. </li>
</ul><p>Children have no absolute right to inherit their parent's estate if the
deceased parent has made a valid will. However, if a child considers that
he/she has not been adequately provided for, he/she may make an application to
court. The child need not be a minor or be dependent in order to use this
procedure. The court has to decide if the parent has "failed in his moral duty
to make proper provision for the child in accordance with his means". Each case
is decided on its merits and the court looks at the situation from the point of
view of a "prudent and just" parent. Anyone considering challenging a will on
these grounds should get legal opinion before applying to the court.</p>

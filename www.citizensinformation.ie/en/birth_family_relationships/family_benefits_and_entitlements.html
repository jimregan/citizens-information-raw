<p>There is a range of social welfare, tax and employment related benefits and
entitlements available to families in Ireland, depending on their
circumstances. The following is an overview of some of these benefits and
entitlements and leads on to more detailed information on the various supports.
</p>

<h3>Social welfare supports</h3>

<p>The Department of Social Protection provides social welfare payments to
support families including cohabiting couples and civil partnerships,
particularly those with children. These payments are both means-tested and
based on social insurance contributions. Supports are also available for those
in low-paid employment and for parents bringing children up without the support
of a partner. There are also payments for orphans. Read about the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/payments_to_families_and_children.html">various
social welfare payments that are available here</a>.</p>

<p>Under EU regulations EU/EEA citizens and Swiss nationals who are employed or
self-employed in Ireland and subject to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_welfare_system_in_ireland.html">Irish
Social Insurance system</a>, do not have to satisfy the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitual
residence condition</a> to qualify for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/">Family
Benefits</a>. </p>

<h3>Taxes</h3>

<p>In the year of marriage or registration of civil partnership, you are
treated as being single for taxation purposes. If however, you would have paid
less tax had you been treated as married or a civil partner, you can claim a
refund. For subsequent years <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/taxation_of_married_people.html">married
people and civil partners can choose from three taxation options</a>. </p>

<p>There are no specific tax reliefs for children. There is, however, an <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/incapacitated_child_tax_credit.html">Incapaciated
Child Tax Credit</a> if your child is permanently incapacitated and a Home
Carer's Tax Credit where one spouse is caring for a dependant such as a child.
The Revenue Commissioner's <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it66.pdf">leaflet on the Home
Carer's Tax Credit is available here (pdf)</a> while information on <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/">tax
reliefs for people with disabilities is available here</a>. </p>

<p>There are <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/one_parent_family_tax_credits_and_reliefs.html">specific
tax reliefs for one-parent families</a>. There are also other <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/introduction_to_income_tax_credits_and_reliefs.html">tax
credits and allowances which families can avail of</a>. </p>

<h3>Birth</h3>

<p>There are both <a shape="rect" href="benefits_and_entitlements_relating_to_birth.html">employment-related
entitlements and social welfare payments</a> that you may be able to avail of
related to the birth of a child. If you are entitled to <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/parental_leave.html">parental
leave</a> you can take unpaid leave to look after children without affecting
most of your employment rights.</p>

<h3>Death</h3>

<p>There are certain once-off payments provided by Department of Social
Protection that are available to help out <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/death_related_benefits/benefits_and_entitlements_following_a_death.html">families
around the time of bereavement</a>. There are, for example, grants to help with
funeral costs. There are also specific rules about <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs_following_a_death.html">taxation
in the year of a person's death and tax credits for widows and surviving civil
partners</a>. <br></p>

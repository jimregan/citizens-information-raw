<p>A woman who is experiencing low risk pregnancy may choose to have a home
birth. The Health Service Executive (HSE) has a <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/maternity/homebirth_services.html">National
Home Birth Service</a> for eligible expectant mothers who wish to have a home
birth under the care of a self-employed community midwife (SECM).</p>

<p>In some HSE areas the service may be available through a maternity hospital
or a HSE scheme. However in other HSE areas, only private SECMs are available
to attend a home birth – see ‘How to apply’ below.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you want to avail of the National Home Birth Service, you will first need
to contact your Local Health Office. You will be put through to the designated
official who is a qualified midwife. You will be sent an information pack.</p>

<p>You then contact a self-employed community midwife (SECM). You and the
midwife should fill out an application form for the service. You send the form
to the designated official who will assess your eligibility for the service. If
your application is accepted, this will entitle you to free antenatal, delivery
and postnatal services. The HSE will also provide you with a Home Birth Pack
with all you will need for a home delivery. You can find more information about
the process in <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/maternity/homebirth_services.html#Appendix%204">Appendix
4 Pathway of Care</a> on hse.ie.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can engage a self-employed community midwife (SECM)
privately and your antenatal, delivery and postnatal care will be provided by
them.</p>

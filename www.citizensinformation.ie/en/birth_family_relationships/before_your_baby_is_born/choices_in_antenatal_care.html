<p>If you think you are pregnant, the first step is to visit your GP. You may
already have completed a pregnancy test. They will do some preliminary tests,
such as taking your blood, and will use the date of your last monthly period to
estimate the date the baby is due (the due date). They will then discuss your
plans for antenatal care. Your GP will then provide you with a 'letter of
referral' to the maternity hospital if that is where you opt to have your baby.
(Not all hospitals insist on a letter of referral). If you wish to have your
baby at home, you can read our document on <a shape="rect" href="home_birth.html">home birth</a>.</p>

<p>You may opt for services under the <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/women_s_health/maternity_and_infant_welfare_services.html">Maternity
and Infant Care Scheme</a>, which is a system of combined care, split between
your general practitioner and a maternity unit / hospital obstetrician.
Alternatively, you may choose to visit the hospital's antenatal clinic, either
as a <span>public, semi-private or private</span> patient.</p>

<h3>Public care</h3>

<p>All expectant mothers who are ordinarily resident in the State are entitled
to free maternity care, covering antenatal visits, labour and delivery and
postnatal care. </p>

<p>When you ring the hospital to make your first appointment, you will be asked
if you intend to visit as a public, semi-private or private patient. </p>

<p>If you are a public patient, you will attend the hospital's antenatal clinic
(or hospital clinics based in the community). You may see the same doctor on
each visit, or you may not. Alternatively, if your pregnancy is uncomplicated,
you may elect to visit the midwives' clinic if the hospital has one. This is
staffed by experienced midwives and again, can ensure you continuity of
care.</p>

<p>When you come into the hospital for labour and delivery, you will be
delivered by staff midwives and may not see a doctor unless you experience
complications. You may not have met the midwives or doctors who attend your
labour and delivery. After the birth of your baby, you will be moved to the
public ward for your stay, generally about 3 days. A small number of hospitals
now offer early discharge schemes, allowing you to go home early from hospital
with follow-up care. For details, please contact your local hospital or consult
the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.bump2babe.ie/">Cuidi√∫ Consumer Guide to
Maternity Services in Ireland</a>. </p>

<h3>Semi-private and private care</h3>

<p>If you are attending as a <span>semi-private patient,</span> you may see a
consultant privately, or attend the semi-private clinic. This clinic is run by
the consultant and their team. In some hospitals a team member may deliver your
baby, or the doctor on duty at the time. After delivery, you will stay on a
semi-private ward, with approximately 3-5 other mothers.</p>

<p>If you are attending <span>privately</span>, you will be appointed your own
consultant whom you will see at each visit. Your consultant may not necessarily
be available to deliver your baby. Private care also entitles you to a private
room, although, again, this is dependent on availability.</p>

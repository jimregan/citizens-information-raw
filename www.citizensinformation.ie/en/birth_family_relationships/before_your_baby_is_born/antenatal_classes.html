<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Antenatal classes provide you with information about pregnancy, labour and
delivery, and baby care. Many of them focus on labour and delivery alone, but
others include practical advice on how to care for your baby and adjust to
parenthood. </p>

<p>Antenatal classes are provided by your hospital and you will need to
telephone them to book your place. Classes are generally offered for expectant
mothers alone, or for couples from about 30 weeks. </p>

<p>Some hospitals provide classes for couples with special needs. You will need
to contact your local hospital or the <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/how_health_is_organised/health_boards.html">Health Service
Executive (HSE)</a> for details. You can read more in our document on <a href="antenatal_visits.html">antenatal visits</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lf71d5">Time off work and antenatal classes</h2>

<p>Section 8 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0028/index.html">Maternity
Protection (Amendment) Act 2004</a> allows pregnant women to take paid time off
work to attend one set of antenatal classes (other than the last 3 classes in a
set). For example, if you are attending a set of 8 classes and this is your
first pregnancy in employment you are only entitled to be paid while attending
5 of those classes. You do not have the right to paid time off work to attend
antenatal classes each time you are pregnant and in employment. The entitlement
covers one set of classes only. If for any reason you are unable to attend some
classes due to reasons beyond your control (that is, premature birth, illness,
miscarriage or stillbirth) you can carry over your entitlement to paid time off
work to attend any untaken classes to your subsequent pregnancies (except the
last 3 in a set). </p>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/si/0653.html">Maternity Protection
(Time off for Ante–Natal Classes) Regulations 2004</a> expectant fathers have
a once-off right to paid time off work to attend the 2 antenatal classes
immediately prior to the birth. This entitlement <span>does not extend to every
pregnancy</span> while the woman is in employment – it is only a once-off
right. </p>

<p>In order to take this time off work, the employee must notify their employer
in writing at least 2 weeks before classes commence, outlining the dates and
times of the classes. Employers can request written evidence of the classes
(dates and times). </p>

<p>Classes are generally for a number of sessions and topics covered may
include:</p>
<ul><li>Looking after your health during pregnancy </li>
  <li>Growth and development of the baby during pregnancy </li>
  <li>Options for labour and delivery </li>
  <li>Pain relief during labour </li>
  <li>When to go into hospital </li>
  <li>What to expect during labour </li>
  <li>Breastfeeding support and advice </li>
  <li>Emotional aspects of becoming a parent </li>
  <li>Physical care of your baby </li>
  <li>Returning to work/childcare arrangements </li>
</ul></div>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Antenatal classes held by your local public maternity hospital are
<span>free of charge</span>. A fee is payable for private classes. Check with
your maternity hospital for more information.</p>

<p>Your midwife or doctor will probably ask you if you plan to attend an
antenatal class at the hospital. These classes are generally busy, so you will
need to book early. You can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/acutehospitals/hospitals/">find
contact information for public hospitals here</a>. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Generally, you will have approximately 8-10 antenatal appointments with your
doctor or midwife during your pregnancy. You may visit your GP, antenatal
clinic or midwife monthly until 32 weeks, fortnightly after that and you may
have weekly visits in the last month. </p>

<p>You are entitled to take paid time off from your employment to attend
antenatal appointments (this also includes some <a href="antenatal_classes.html">antenatal classes)</a>. These employment
rights are protected in Irish law through the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0034/index.html">Maternity
Protection Acts 1994 and 2004</a>, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/si/0018.html">Maternity Protection
(Time Off for Ante-Natal Care and Post-Natal Care) Regulations 1995</a>, and
the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/si/0017.html">Maternity Protection
(Disputes and Appeals) Regulations 1995</a>. </p>

<h3>The first antenatal visit</h3>

<p>Your first visit to hospital can be any time from 12-20 weeks in the
pregnancy. The purpose of this visit is to get a full picture of your health
and the health of your baby. You can expect to speak to a midwife, who will ask
a range of background questions about your health and medical history. This
will also be an opportunity for you to ask questions about your care and the
range of services that are available to you. You will be asked for a urine
sample, will have your blood pressure taken and will have blood tests. The
purpose of the blood tests will be explained to you. In some hospitals, you may
have an ultrasound scan on your first visit, at others you will have it at
around 20 weeks.</p>

<p>The visit lasts approximately 2 hours. If your pregnancy is normal,
subsequent visits will be much shorter. Visits can be shared between the
hospital and your GP or midwife. </p>

<h3>Subsequent visits</h3>

<p>At each visit you will provide a urine sample, your blood pressure will be
taken and you will be examined. If you have any questions or worries related to
your pregnancy, you should ask the midwife or doctor. Most hospitals will have
a system of parentcraft classes which you and your partner or friend can attend
near the time of birth. These sessions will provide you with an opportunity to
learn more about <a shape="rect" href="../after_your_baby_is_born/breastfeeding.html">breastfeeding</a>,
nutrition, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and preparing you and your family
for the birth of the baby.</p>

<h3>Employment and antenatal visits</h3>

<p>If you become pregnant while in employment you are entitled, under
employment law, to take time off to attend antenatal appointments. You should
apply to your employer in writing providing medical evidence of your pregnancy
and telling your employer that you need time off to attend antenatal
appointments. You should give at least 2 weeks' written notice of the date and
time of your appointments. </p>

<p>If this notice is not given for reasons not in your control, then you can
retain your entitlement, provided you write to your employer with an
explanation and with the notice. You will need to do this within one week of
the appointment. </p>

<p>For any visit after the first appointment your employer may ask to see your
appointment card. You are entitled to medical visits after the birth of your
baby for 14 weeks following the birth, including any period taken on <a href="../../employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/maternity_leave.html">maternity
leave</a> following the birth.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to take paid time off from work to attend some antenatal
classes. For expectant fathers, this is a once-off right to attend the 2
classes immediately prior to the birth. For expectant mothers, the entitlement
is to attend only one set of classes (except the last 3 in a set) over all her
pregnancies while in employment.</p>

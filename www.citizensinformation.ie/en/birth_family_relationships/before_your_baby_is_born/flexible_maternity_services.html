<p>Many hospitals now offer more flexibility in their maternity services,
operating early discharge schemes, <a href="home_birth.html">home births</a>
and midwives' clinics.</p>

<h3>Community Midwives </h3>

<p>Community Midwives enable women who are deemed at 'low risk of
complications' to see members of a dedicated midwives' team for their antenatal
visits and to have a member of this team deliver their baby, either in hospital
(Domino Scheme) or at home. Antenatal visits are made either to the Community
Midwives' Clinic or to a local health centre. Additional visits are made to the
woman's home.</p>

<p>Each woman interested in the scheme will have a routine scan at around 18-22
weeks and a full physical examination to assess suitability for the scheme. If
any problems develop during the pregnancy or in labour, you will be immediately
transferred back to full hospital care</p>

<p>With Community Midwives you are entitled to an early discharge after birth,
if you wish, and the midwife will visit you at home for up to a week after the
birth. In some areas, Community Midwives provide Domino care where you may be
transferred home 6-12 hours after giving birth in hospital, provided there are
no complications.</p>

<h3>Midwifery-led clinics</h3>

<p>Midwifery-led clinics provide healthy women, who don't have risk factors for
pregnancy and labour, a choice in how they access maternity care. A team of
experienced midwives provides the care. Mothers can give birth in a uniquely
designed birth room where they are cared for by a midwife and where they can
avail of facilities such as music, a water pool or supportive aids (for
example, gym ball or bean bags) if required. At any point where a problem is
detected or anticipated, formal contact is established with the obstetric or
paediatric team on call or the woman's GP, if appropriate.</p>

<p>Mothers can have an early discharge home and one of the team of midwives
will visit them at home, daily if necessary.</p>

<p>Nullity of civil partnership is a declaration by a court that your supposed
civil partnership is null and void, and that no valid civil partnership exists
between you and your partner. In other words, it is a declaration that
<span>the supposed civil partnership never happened</span>.</p>

<p>Nullity (or annulment) is <span>not the same as dissolution</span>.
Dissolution is a declaration ending a valid civil partnership. Nullity is a
declaration that a valid civil partnership never existed. </p>

<p>In <a href="nullity_of_marriage.html">nullity of marriage</a> law, there
are two types of marriages that may be annulled or cancelled. There are
<em>void</em> marriages and there are <em>voidable</em> marriages. If your
marriage is void, it is regarded as never having taken place. If your marriage
is voidable, it is considered to be a valid marriage until a decree of
annulment is made. </p>

<p>In nullity of civil partnership law, there are only void civil partnerships.
This means the civil partnerships are regarded as never having taken place.</p>

<p>Technically, if your civil partnership never took place, then there is no
need to go to court to obtain a decree of annulment - you may simply act as
though the civil partnership never happened. However, it is advisable to obtain
a court order declaring that your civil partnership is annulled in order to
remove any doubt.</p>

<p>A decree of annulment can only be made if one of the parties to the civil
partnership applies to the court for a decree of nullity. Any person whom the
court believes has sufficient standing to do so may also apply. If the court
decides that your civil partnership is void, it will then declare that your
civil partnership never existed.</p>

<p>You can find out about the implications of a decree of nullity in our
document on the <a href="consequences_of_a_civil_annulment_of_civil_partnership.html">consequences
of an annulment of a civil partnership</a>. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>In order to obtain an annulment (nullity) of your alleged civil partnership,
you must make an application to the <a shape="rect" href="../../../justice/courts_system/circuit_court_civil_juris.html">Circuit
Court</a> or the <a shape="rect" href="../../../justice/courts_system/high_court_civil_jurisdiction.html">High
Court</a>.</p>

<p>To prove to the court that your civil partnership is void you must show one
of the following grounds:</p>
<ul><li>At the time of the registration of the civil partnership there was a lack
    of capacity. In other words, you or your parner was incapable of entering
    into a binding contract. This may happen: 
    <p>- where one of you was already validly married or in a civil partnership
    or </p>
    <p>- where you were too closely related to each other or </p>
    <p>- where you were of opposite biological sex or</p>
    <p>- where one of you was under 18 years of age.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The formal requirements for the registration of a civil partnership were
    not followed. For example, you did not give due notice to the civil
    registrar. </li>
  <li>At the time of the registration of the civil partnership, there was a
    lack of consent. In other words, you or your partner did not give free and
    fully informed consent to the civil partnership. This may be due to duress,
    (i.e., you were forced into the civil partnership), mistake,
    misrepresentation or fraud. It may also be due to the fact that you or your
    partner was suffering from a mental illness at that time. </li>

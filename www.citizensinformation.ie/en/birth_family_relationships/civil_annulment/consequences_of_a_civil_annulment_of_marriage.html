<p>Whether or not your marriage is <a shape="rect" href="nullity_of_marriage.html">void or voidable</a>, the legal consequences
of a civil annulment of your marriage are the same. Your marriage is declared
to be invalid from the start. Therefore, your marriage never legally
happened.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The most obvious consequence of a court declaration of nullity is that you
are now entitled to marry. If you do get married after a civil annulment, you
are not committing bigamy, as your new marriage is your only valid one.</p>

<p>If you have already remarried, that is, you have married before an order of
annulment was actually made by the court, your second marriage may have
appeared invalid and bigamous. However, once the annulment order is granted,
your second marriage is validated, as your first marriage has now been declared
invalid.</p>

<p>If your marriage is annulled, it also means that you lose the rights that
you enjoyed as a married person. Therefore:</p>
<ul><li>The home that you shared with your former partner is not a <a shape="rect" href="../separation_and_divorce/family_home.html">family
    home</a>. If your former partner is the legal owner of the house, they can
    sell or lease it without your consent.</li>
  <li>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1965/en/act/pub/0027/index.html">Succession
    Act 1965</a>, when a married person dies, their spouse is <a shape="rect" href="../married_couples/marital_status_and_inheritance.html">legally
    entitled to a share of their estate</a> whether or not they have <a shape="rect" href="/en/death/before_a_death/making_a_will.html">left a
    will</a>. As your marriage never happened, you do not have any succession
    rights if your former partner dies.</li>
  <li>Once your marriage has been annulled, you do not have a right to apply to
    the court to order your former partner to pay <a shape="rect" href="../separation_and_divorce/maintenance_orders_and_agreements.html">maintenance</a>
    to support you, as only spouses may apply to a court for an order for
    maintenance. However, if there were children born during the annulled
    marriage, you may apply to the court to order your former partner to pay
    child support.</li>
  <li>If your marriage is annulled, it will also have consequences for your
    children. However, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1987/en/act/pub/0026/index.html">Status
    of Children Act 1987</a> protects the legal rights of children whose
    parents are not married to each other. Under the Succession Act 1965, if
    you die and do not provide for your child adequately in your will, that
    child may apply to the court for a share of your estate. If you die without
    a will, your children have an automatic right to a share in your estate.
    These rights apply equally to children born outside of marriage and
    children born within marriage, so an annulment of your marriage will not
    affect your children's succession rights.</li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../married_couples/guardianship_status_of_fathers.html">The right of
    a father to be a guardian of his child</a> is affected by an annulment of
    marriage. Normally, when a child is born to married parents, both parents
    are the joint guardians of the child. When a marriage is annulled, the
    father will only be regarded as a joint guardian of the child if he
    reasonably believed that his marriage ceremony was valid, and if the child
    was born before the annulment order, or less than 10 months after it.</li>
</ul><p>It is important to be aware that a church annulment does not have any legal
effect. It does not mean that you may legally remarry - although it may mean
that you can remarry in the eyes of the church.</p>

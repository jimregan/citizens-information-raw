<p>Where your civil partnership is considered <a href="nullity_of_civil_partnership.html">void</a>, the legal consequences of
an annulment of your civil partnership are that your civil partnership is
declared to be invalid from the start. Therefore, your civil partnership never
legally happened.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The most obvious consequence of a court declaration of nullity is that you
are now entitled to marry. </p>

<p>If you had already married or entered into a new civil partnership, i.e. you
had married or entered into a civil partnership before an order of annulment
was actually made by the court, your marriage or new civil partnership may have
appeared invalid. However, once the annulment order is granted, your
marriage/civil partnereship is validated , as your first civil partnership has
now been declared invalid.</p>

<p>If your civil partnership is annulled, it also means that you lose the
rights that you enjoyed as a civil partner. Therefore:</p>
<ul><li>The home that you shared with your former partner is not a <a shape="rect" href="../separation_and_divorce/family_home.html">shared
    home</a> . If your former partner is the legal owner of the house, he or
    she can sell or lease it without your consent.</li>
  <li>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1965/en/act/pub/0027/index.html">Succession
    Act 1965</a>, when a civil partner dies, the surviving civil partner is <a shape="rect" href="../civil_partnerships/civil_partnership_and_same_sex_couples.html">legally
    entitled to a share of his/her estate</a> whether or not he or she has <a shape="rect" href="/en/death/before_a_death/making_a_will.html">left a
    will</a> . As your civil partnership never happened, you do not have any
    succession rights if your former partner dies.</li>
  <li>Once your civil partnership has been annulled, you do not have a right to
    apply to the court to order your former partner to pay <a shape="rect" href="../separation_and_divorce/maintenance_orders_and_agreements.html">maintenance</a>
    to support you, as only civil partners may apply to a court for an order
    for maintenance. </li>
</ul><p></p>

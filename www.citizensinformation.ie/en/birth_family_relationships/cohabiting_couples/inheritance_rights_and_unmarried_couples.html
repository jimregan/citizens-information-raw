<p>If you are at least 18 years old and of sound mind, you may <a shape="rect" href="/en/death/before_a_death/making_a_will.html">make a will</a>. If you later
get married or enter a civil partnership, that will is automatically cancelled.
However, if you do not get married, or enter a civil partnership, and enter
into cohabitation (i.e., move in with a partner), it has no effect on your
pre-existing will. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you are married or in a civil partnership, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1965/en/act/pub/0027/index.html">Succession
Act 1965</a> gives your surviving spouse/civil partner <span>a legal
right</span> to a share of your estate when you die, no matter what you have
said or specified in your will. This does not apply to cohabiting couples. In
other words, if you are in a cohabiting relationship, there is nothing to
prevent you from leaving some or all of your property to your partner in your
will. </p>

<p>However, if you are or have been married or in a civil partnership, your
spouse/civil partner may be legally entitled to a share of your estate even
though you are now separated from him/her. </p>

<p>If you are in a cohabiting relationship and you die without a will, your
partner has <span>no right to any share of the estate</span> no matter how long
you have been together, apart from what was held jointly. Many people are not
aware of this, so it is very important to know your rights in this
situation.</p>

<p>Under the <a href="../problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/redress_scheme_for_cohabiting_couples.html">redress
scheme for cohabiting couples</a> a qualified cohabitant may apply for
provision to be made from the estate of a deceased cohabitant. Where the
partner dies in an existing relationship, it is not necessary to show financial
dependence.</p>

<p>The natural children of parents who are born inside or outside marriage and
adopted children have the same inheritance rights. </p>

<p>In the case of a cohabiting couple where the surviving partner inherits the
family home, the surviving partner may be liable for inheritance tax, unless
the surviving partner qualifies for <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/cat/leaflets/cat10.html">dwelling house tax
exemption</a>.</p>

<p>There is more information on inheritance rights in the <a shape="rect" href="/en/death/the_deceaseds_estate/what_happens_the_deceaseds_estate.html">document
on what happens the deceased's estate</a>.</p>

<p>Making a will can ensure that proper arrangements are made for your
dependants and that your property is distributed in the way you wish after you
die, subject to certain rights of spouses/civil partners and children. A
solicitor can help you draft a will or you can draft one yourself. </p>

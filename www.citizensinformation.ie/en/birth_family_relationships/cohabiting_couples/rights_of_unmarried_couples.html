<p>Cohabitants are defined in the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Civil
Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010</a> as
two same-sex or opposite-sex adults who are:</p>
<ul><li>Not married to each other and </li>
  <li>Not in a registered civil partnership and </li>
  <li>Not related within the prohibited degrees of relationship (broadly
    speaking, relationships which would make them ineligible to marry each
    other) and </li>
  <li>Living together in an intimate and committed relationship</li>
</ul><p>Cohabitants (cohabiting couples) do not possess the same legal rights and
obligations as <a href="../married_couples/how_marriage_changes_your_legal_status.html">married
couples</a> or <a href="../civil_partnerships/civil_partnership_and_same_sex_couples.html">civil
partnerships</a>. Given the limited legal recognition of your relationshipship,
this will obviously have some significant implications for various parts of
your life.</p>

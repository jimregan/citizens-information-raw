<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>The non-marital family is not recognised by the Irish Constitution and it
does not possess the same <a shape="rect" href="rights_of_unmarried_couples.html">legal rights and obligations</a> as the
family based on marriage. </p>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0021/index.html">Adoption
Act 2010</a>, a child may be <a shape="rect" href="../adoption_and_fostering/adopting_a_child.html">adopted</a> by married
couples, a mother or father of the child or a relative of the child. In
specific cases, the Adoption Authority of Ireland may decide that it is
desirable that some other person can adopt a child. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Unmarried couples may not jointly adopt a child. A joint adoption by a
couple is only possible where that couple is married and living together. This
rule prevents an unmarried couple from jointly adopting a child even where one
of the parties is the biological or legal parent of the child. There are no
proposals to change adoption law in Ireland to permit adoption by unmarried
couples.</p>

<p>Under the adoption legislation, it is possible for a single person to adopt
if the Adoption Authority considers it desirable and it must regard the welfare
of the child as its first and paramount consideration. This means that if you
are living with a same-sex or opposite-sex partner, you may apply to the
Authority to adopt a child in your own right, intending to raise the child with
your partner. However, your partner would have no legal rights in relation to
the child. The fact you are in a relationship is relevant only when evaluating
circumstances that might affect the child's welfare. </p>

<p>For a <a shape="rect" href="../adoption_and_fostering/intercountry_adoption.html">foreign
adoption</a> to be recognised in Ireland, it must comply with the definition of
adoption in Irish law. This means that the rule that only married couples may
jointly adopt will apply.</p>

<h3>Step-parent adoption</h3>

<p>Step-parent adoption refers to the adoption of a child by the birth mother
(usually) and her spouse, who is not the birth father of the child. If only her
spouse adopted the child she would lose her rights and responsibilities in
relation to the child and would no longer be the child's guardian. As mentioned
previously they must be married to each other for both of them to be able to
adopt. They will then both be adoptive parents. You can find out about <a shape="rect" href="http://aai.gov.ie/index.php/domestic-adoption/what-is-domestic-adoption.html">step-parent
adoption on the Adoption Authority's website</a>.</p>

<h3>Consent</h3>

<p>When a child is being adopted there is a requirement to consult the birth
father. If the birth father is a guardian his consent is required. You can <a shape="rect" href="../adoption_and_fostering/adopting_a_child.html">read more
about adoption and consent here</a>.</p>

<p>Surrogate motherhood happens when a woman agrees to be artificially
inseminated or to have an embryo transferred to her womb in order to become
pregnant. She then carries the child to term with the intention of giving the
custody of the child to the person/couple with whom she has made the
agreement.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the surrogate mother is considered the legal mother of the
child and is the child's guardian. Private adoptions are not permitted in
Ireland, and a parent of a child is prohibited from receiving any payment for
giving away a child for adoption. If the child is being adopted, this must be
done through the Adoption Authority of Ireland, and there is no guarantee that
the child of a surrogate mother will be placed with the biological father.</p>

<p>In theory, a man could donate sperm so that his child could be conceived by
a surrogate mother (as long as he did not pay her). He could then apply to the
Adoption Authority for permission to adopt his child. When making its decision,
the Adoption Authority must consider the welfare of the child.</p>

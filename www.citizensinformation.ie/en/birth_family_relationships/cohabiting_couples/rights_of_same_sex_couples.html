<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>In many European countries, legal recognition has been given to same-sex
partnerships to varying degrees. In 2011 a statutory civil partnership
registration scheme for same-sex couples was introduced in Ireland. Following a
vote in favour of marriage equality in a <a href="../../government_in_ireland/elections_and_referenda/referenda/referendum_commission.html">constitutional
referendum</a>, the right for same-sex couples to marry was introduced in
November 2015.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lf443a">Civil partnerships</h2>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Civil
Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010</a> a
statutory civil partnership registration scheme for same-sex couples was
introduced in January 2011. Under the scheme registered civil partners have
broadly the same rights and obligations towards each other as the rights and
obligations of married couples towards each. </p>

<p>Since 16 November 2015, no new civil partnerships can be registered unless
the couple have notified the registrar of their intention to enter a civil
partnership before that date. </p>

partnership and same-sex couples</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l2e9f9">Marriage</h2>

<p>Since 16 November 2015, it is possible for same-sex couples to become
legally married and to have the same rights and obligations towards each other
as opposite-sex married couples. It is also possible for a couple in a civil
partnership to marry. More information is available in our <a href="../getting_married/getting_married.html">document on getting
married</a>. </p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l50230">Cohabitants</h2>

<p>Under the 2010 Act cohabitants are defined as two same-sex or opposite-sex
adults who are:</p>
<ul><li>Not married to each other or in a registered civil partnership</li>
  <li>Not related within the prohibited degrees of relationship (broadly
    speaking, relationships which would make them ineligible to marry each
    other)</li>
  <li>Living together in an intimate and committed relationship. </li>
</ul><p>The Act amended a number of laws where rights are already available to
opposite-sex cohabitants in order to make such rights available to same-sex
cohabitants. These include:</p>
<ul><li>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0027/index.html">Residential
    Tenancies Act 2004</a> was amended to provide that a same-sex cohabitant of
    a deceased tenant has the same entitlement to inherit a tenancy as an
    opposite-sex cohabitant of a deceased tenant has</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1961/en/act/pub/0041/index.html">Civil
    Liability Act 1961</a> now provides that a same-sex cohabitant of a
    deceased person has the same entitlement that an opposite-sex cohabitant
    has to sue for damages in the event of the cohabitantâ€™s wrongful
  death</li>
  <li><em>Qualified cohabitants</em> as defined in the 2010 Act (see below) are
    now entitled to be informed about the registration of an enduring power of
    attorney under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0012/index.html">Powers
    of Attorney Act 1996</a></li>
</ul><h3>Redress scheme</h3>

<p>The Act also introduced a <a href="../cohabiting_couples/redress_scheme_for_cohabiting_couples.html">redress
scheme for cohabiting couples</a> including same-sex cohabiting couples. To be
a a qualified cohabitant for the scheme you must have been a cohabitant for at
least 5 years or for 2 years if you have a child with your partner. If one of
you is still married, then neither of you may be a qualified cohabitant until
the married person has been living apart from his/her spouse for at least 4 of
the previous 5 years. </p>

<h3>Tax and social welfare</h3>

<p>Cohabiting couples (whether same sex or opposite sex) are
<strong>not</strong> treated in the same way as married couples or civil
partners for tax purposes. </p>

<p>Cohabiting opposite-sex couples were already treated in the same way as
married couples in the social welfare system. Since 1 January 2010 cohabiting
same-sex couples are treated the same as cohabiting opposite-sex couples. This
follows changes introduced by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0037/index.html">Social
Welfare and Pensions Act 2010</a>. This means that one of the cohabitants will
be treated as an <a href="../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">adult
dependant</a> when the other cohabitant makes a claim for a social welfare
payment.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lad985">EU citizens and their family
members</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/si/548/made/en/print">European
Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2015</a> transpose <a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/l33152_en.htm">EU
Directive 2004/38/EC</a> into Irish law. The Regulations provide for the
facilitation of entry and residence for EU citizens and their family members.
The Regulations also provide for a wider definition of "family member" , to
include a partner with whom the EU citizen has a durable relationship, duly
attested, and the dependent parents, children under 21 and other dependent
children of that partner. This does not involve the recognition of such
partnerships for other purposes. Read more about <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/rights_of_residence_in_ireland/residence_rights_of_family_members.html">residence

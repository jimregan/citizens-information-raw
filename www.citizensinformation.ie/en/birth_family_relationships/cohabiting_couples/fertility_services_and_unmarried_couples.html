<p>There are a <a href="http://nisig.com/about-infertility/treatments-and-terminology/">number of
different types</a> of <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/women_s_health/fertility_treatment.html">fertility services</a>
available, including artificial insemination and <span>in vitro</span>
fertilisation. Part 3 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/9/enacted/en/html">Children
and Family Relationships Act 2015</a> legislates for donor-assisted human
reproduction, but has not yet been commenced. Medical practice concerning the
provision of Assisted Human Reproduction Services is governed by <a href="http://www.medicalcouncil.ie/News-and-Publications/Reports/Guide-to-Professional-Conduct-and-Ethics-8th-Edition-2016-.pdf">guidelines
issued by the Irish Medical Council (pdf)</a>. </p>

<p>Fertility services are generally available to applicants who are in a
"stable relationship". This is understood to mean married and cohabiting
opposite-sex couples. Clinics generally refuse to make assisted reproduction
available to cohabiting same-sex couples. It has not yet been decided by an
Irish court whether this refusal amounts to discrimination on the grounds of
sexual orientation under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0008/index.html">Equal
Status Act 2000</a> or the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Equality
Act 2004</a>.</p>

<p>Custody is the right to the physical care and control of a child. When the
unmarried parents of a child separate and they cannot agree on who should have
custody of the child, the court may have to decide. </p>

<p>When the court is making its decision about who should have custody of the
child, the most important factor for it is the welfare of the child. Welfare
includes the child's religious, moral, intellectual, physical and social
welfare. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>An unmarried mother is automatically the sole <a href="legal_guardianship_and_unmarried_couples.html">guardian</a> of a child
born outside of marriage and has sole custody. However, it is not necessary for
the father to have guardianship before he applies for <a href="access_to_children_and_unmarried_couples.html">access</a> or custody.
The father can apply for joint or sole custody.</p>

<p>On 18 January 2016 certain provisions of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2015/en/act/pub/0009/index.html">Children
and Family Relationships Act 2015</a> came into effect amending the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1964/act/7/enacted/en/html">Guardianship
of Infants Act 1964</a>. The changes allow for certain other people to apply to
the court for custody:</p>
<ul><li>A relative of the child</li>
  <li>A parent's spouse, civil partner or cohabitant (for at least 3 years)
    with whom the child resides and where they shared parenting of the child
    for at least 2 years</li>
  <li>A person with whom the child resides, if they have provided the child's
    day-to-day care for at least a year and there is no parent or guardian
    willing or able to exercise the powers and responsibilities of
  guardianship</li>
</ul><h3>Court decision</h3>

<p>In general, the courts tend to consider that where the parents of the child
are unmarried, it is in the child's best interests to live with its mother. The
unmarried mother has a superior legal position to the unmarried father and will
usually be granted custody. However, the courts will usually grant a right of
access to the unmarried father so that he can have regular contact with his
child.</p>

<p>As part of the decion-making process, the court will consider the moral
example given by a parent to his or her child, the influence that parent's
behaviour may have on the child's development and the manner in which the
parent's conduct is likely to affect the child's welfare.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for a judge to place restrictions on access where one
parent has a new relationship. This is done on the basis that introducing a new
partner to a child can be a delicate matter. The court may require, (or you
might want to present), a psychological assessment carried out by a child
psychiatrist or psychologist. Legal aid may pay for this assessment. Usually
where professional opinions are sought by the court, it will be greatly
influenced by the conclusions of the professional.</p>

<h3>Child placed for adoption</h3>

<p>If the unmarried mother does not want custody of the child and intends
placing it or has already placed it for adoption, the unmarried father may
still apply for custody of the child. The essential issue for the court in
deciding whether the father should have custody will be the welfare of the
child. The length of time that the child has been with the adoptive parents
will be a very important factor.</p>

<h3>Appealing a decision</h3>

<p>It's important to remember that decisions regarding custody, access and
maintenance of children are always open to review if circumstances change. You
can also appeal against decisions of the initial court if you are dissatisfied
with the result.</p>

<h3>Enforcement order</h3>

<p>The court can impose an enforcement order if you have been been unreasonably
denied the custody the court granted you. This may include: </p>
<ul><li>You getting compensatory time with the child </li>
  <li>Your expenses being reimbursed</li>
  <li>One or both of you attending parenting programmes, family counselling or
    receiving information on mediation</li>

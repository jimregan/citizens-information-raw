<p>If you have a right of access to a child, you have the right to spend time
with the child and to take the child out for specified periods of time. You may
also have the right to have the child reside with and go on holidays with you
for a proportion of the school holidays and the right to have the child stay
overnight in your house on alternate weekends. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>When the parents of a child separate and they cannot agree on access rights,
the courts will decide. The welfare of the child will be the most important
factor. In general, the courts consider that it is very important for the
welfare of a child that it should have a relationship with both its parents,
and they are slow to deny access rights to the natural parent of a child.</p>

<p>By law, unmarried mothers are the sole <a shape="rect" href="legal_guardianship_and_unmarried_couples.html">guardians</a> of children
born outside of marriage. A father may apply for access whether or not he is a
guardian. He can do this even if his name is not on the child's birth
certificate, and even where his application for joint guardianship has been
turned down.</p>

<p>If both guardianship and access are being applied for, then separate
applications must be made, but both applications will be heard by the court at
the same time.</p>

<p>Unless there are unusual circumstances, the unmarried mother is usually
granted custody of her child and the unmarried father is granted access
rights.</p>

<h3>Same-sex couples</h3>

<p>If your same-sex relationship breaks down, you may wish to continue to have
contact with your former partner's child. Section 55 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2015/en/act/pub/0009/index.html">Children
and Family Relationships Act 2015</a> has amended the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1964/act/7/enacted/en/html">Guardianship
of Infants Act 1964</a> so that a person with whom a child resides or has
previously resided can apply to the District Court for access to the child.</p>

<h3>Grandparents</h3>

<p>Section 9 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/40/enacted/en/html">Children
Act 1997</a> amended the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 so that a relative,
such as a grandparent, can apply to the District Court for access.</p>

<h3>Enforcement order</h3>

<p>The court can impose an enforcement order if you have been been unreasonably
denied the access the court granted you. This may include: </p>
<ul><li>You getting compensatory time with the child </li>
  <li>Your expenses being reimbursed</li>
  <li>One or both of you attending parenting programmes, family counselling or
    receiving information on mediation</li>
</ul></div>

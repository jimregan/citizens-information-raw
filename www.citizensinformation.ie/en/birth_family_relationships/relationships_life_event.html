<h3>Cohabiting relationships</h3>

<p><a href="cohabiting_couples/rights_of_unmarried_couples.html">Cohabiting
couples</a> do not possess the same legal rights and obligations as married
couples or civil partnerships in Irish law. This has important implications for
a number of areas in your life - including <a shape="rect" href="unmarried_couples/inheritance_rights_and_unmarried_couples.html">inheritance
rights</a>, <a shape="rect" href="unmarried_couples/property_rights_and_unmarried_couples.html">property
ownership</a>, <a shape="rect" href="unmarried_couples/custody_of_children_and_unmarried_couples.html">custody</a>
and <a shape="rect" href="unmarried_couples/legal_guardianship_and_unmarried_couples.html">guardianship
of children</a>, <a shape="rect" href="unmarried_couples/adoption_and_unmarried_couples.html">adoption</a> and
<a shape="rect" href="unmarried_couples/fostering_and_unmarried_couples.html">fostering</a>.
There is a <a href="problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/redress_scheme_for_cohabiting_couples.html">redress
scheme for cohabiting couples</a> who have been in a long-term cohabiting
relationship.</p>

<h3>Getting married</h3>

<p>CitizensInformation.ie provides information that you need if you are getting
married in Ireland and abroad, including information on <a shape="rect" href="getting_married/different_legal_ways_of_getting_married.html">different
legal ways of getting married</a>, <a shape="rect" href="married_couples/how_marriage_changes_your_legal_status.html">how marriage
will change your legal status</a>, <a shape="rect" href="getting_married/legal_prerequisites_for_marriage.html">legal
prerequisites for marriage</a>, <a shape="rect" href="getting_married/notification_requirements_for_marriage.html">notification

marriage</a> and <a shape="rect" href="getting_married/getting_married_abroad.html">getting married
abroad</a>.</p>

<h3>Same-sex relationships</h3>

<p>Before 16 November 2015 there was provision for the legal registration of
same-sex couples as <a href="civil_partnerships/civil_partnership_and_same_sex_couples.html">civil
partnerships</a>. This provision has been repealed for new civil parnerships.
However, it is now possible for same-sex couples to become legally married and
to have the same rights and obligations towards each other as opposite-sex
married couples.It is also possible for a couple in a civil partnership to
marry. CitizensInformation.ie provides information on <a href="civil_partnerships/how_civil_partnership_changes_your_legal_status.html">how
civil partnership changes your legal status</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="cohabiting_couples/rights_of_same_sex_couples.html">rights
of cohabiting same-sex couples</a> are similar to the <a href="cohabiting_couples/rights_of_unmarried_couples.html">rights of
cohabiting opposite-sex couples</a>. Our section on cohabiting couples looks at
various aspects of your life with your partner. We also examine the issue of <a shape="rect" href="same_sex_couples/surrogate_motherhood_and_same_sex_couples.html">surrogate
motherhood</a>.</p>

<h3>Separation, divorce and dissolution</h3>

<p>The end of a marriage or a civil partnership is a difficult and traumatic
process. The information provided on the Citizens Information website will help
you deal with the different practical aspects of a marriage or civil
partnership breakdown. </p>

<p>Information is available on the <a shape="rect" href="separation_and_divorce/legal_options_following_marital_breakdown.html">legal
options following a marital breakdown</a> and the legal options following a
civil partnership breakdown, such as <a shape="rect" href="separation_and_divorce/divorce_decrees.html">divorce</a>, <a shape="rect" href="separation_and_divorce/judicial_separation.html">judicial separation</a>,
<a shape="rect" href="separation_and_divorce/separation_agreement.html">separation
agreements</a> and <a href="separation_and_divorce/dissolution_decrees.html">dissolution</a>.
There is also information on what happens <a shape="rect" href="separation_and_divorce/family_home.html">the family or shared home</a>
and <a shape="rect" href="separation_and_divorce/maintenance_orders_and_agreements.html">maintenance
</a>agreements.</p>

<h3>Grandparents</h3>

<p>Grandparents also have certain rights in relation to their grandchild. Where
grandparents are having difficulty in maintaining contact with their
grandchild, they can apply for <a href="cohabiting_couples/access_to_children_and_unmarried_couples.html">access
to the child</a> through the District Court. Access can also be applied for if
a child is in the care of the HSE.</p>

<p>Any relative, including a grandparent, can apply to the court for <a href="cohabiting_couples/custody_of_children_and_unmarried_couples.html">custody
of a child</a>. The court will not normally make an order for custody without
the consent of the child’s guardians. However, it may dispense with the
consent if it is satisfied that it is in the best interest of the child to make
the order. If the grandparents are the main carers of the child and the child
is not being properly maintained financially by either or both parents, the
grandparents can apply to the District Court for a <a href="separation_and_divorce/maintenance_orders_and_agreements.html">maintenance
order</a>.</p>

<p>A parent can nominate a person (including a grandparent) to act as a
guardian if the parent is unable, through serious illness or injury, to
exercise their guardianship rights. Where parents die without making a will
appointing someone to act as guardian of their child, the grandparents can <a href="cohabiting_couples/legal_guardianship_and_unmarried_couples.html">apply
to the District Court to be appointed guardians</a>. Grandparents can also
apply for guardianship:</p>
<ul><li>If they have provided the day-to-day care of the child for a continuous
    period of 12 months or more and</li>
  <li>Where there is no parent or guardian willing or able to exercise
    guardianship rights and responsibilities in respect of the child</li>
</ul><p>The court will decide the extent of the guardianship rights the grandparents
will have.</p>

<p>Grandparents may be able to <a href="adoption_and_fostering/adopting_a_child.html">adopt</a> or <a href="adoption_and_fostering/fostering.html">foster</a> a grandchild.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="http://www.treoir.ie/target-grandparents.php">more
information on grandparent’s rights</a> on Treoir’s website. Treoir have
also published a booklet entitled <a href="http://www.treoir.ie/cms-assets/documents/35932-936244.being-there-for-them.pdf">Being
there for them (pdf)</a> for grandparents of children whose parents are not
married to each other.</p>

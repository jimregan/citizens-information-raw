<p>It is a legal requirement in Ireland that a record be kept of each birth,
marriage and death that occurs in the State. Up to 5 December 2005, these
events were recorded locally in the district where they occurred. Since that
date they can be recorded in any Registrar's District. Records of all births,
marriages and deaths are held nationally in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/General-Register-Office.aspx">General
Register Office</a>, the central civil repository for records relating to
Births, Deaths and Marriages in Ireland.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0003/index.html">Civil
Registration Act 2004</a> changed some of the rules about registering a birth
or death. These changes took effect from 5 December 2005. They took effect for
marriages from 5 November 2007</p>

<p>When a birth, marriage or death is recorded in Ireland, a certificate is
issued to the individual(s) concerned (i.e. the parents in the event of a
birth, the couple in the event of a marriage and the next-of-kin in the event
of a death). This record of the birth, death or marriage is a very important
legal document and should be kept in a safe place. A birth certificate is
required if you wish to enrol your child in school, <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/travel_abroad/passports/applying_for_or_renewing_an_irish_passport.html">apply
for an Irish passport</a>, etc. A death certificate is required if you are
dealing with the deceased person's estate, etc.</p>

<p>If you need to apply for a birth, marriage or death certificate, or a copy
of these certificates you can apply online or get in touch with the appropriate
Registrar in any Registrar's District. You can also apply to the General
Register Office in Roscommon. Adopted children's Birth Certificates are only
available from the General Register Office.</p>

<p>You will be required to <span>pay a fee</span> if you require a copy of
these certificates.</p>

<p>Records of marriages (other than Roman Catholic) held in the General
Register Office (Roscommon) date back to 1 April 1845. Records of births,
deaths and Roman Catholic marriages date back to 1 January 1864. The General
Register Office does not engage in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/GRO_Research.aspx">family history
research</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The Registrar you need to contact used to be determined by where the event
took place - not where you lived at the time, or where you live now. Since 5
December 2005 you may contact any Registrar. Birth Certificates may be
obtained, once the registration of the birth has taken place, from the
Registrar directly or from any Registrar's Office. If you have any difficulty
in determining the identity of a Registrar you should contact the local
Superintendent Registrar's Office as detailed below for the required
information.</p>

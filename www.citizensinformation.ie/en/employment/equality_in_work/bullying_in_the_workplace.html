<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Bullying is repeated inappropriate behaviour that undermines your right to
dignity at work. It can be done by one or more persons and it is aimed at an
individual or a group to make them feel inferior to other people. Bullying can
be verbal bullying, physical bullying or cyber bullying which is carried out on
the internet or mobile phones, through social networking sites, email and
texts. It can take many different forms such as: </p>
<ul><li>Social exclusion and isolation </li>
  <li>Damaging someone’s reputation by gossip or rumours </li>
  <li>Intimidation </li>
  <li>Aggressive or obscene language </li>
  <li>Repeated requests with impossible tasks or targets </li>
</ul><p>In 2005 the <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/Publications/Publication-files/Report-of-the-Expert-Advisory-Group-on-Workplace-Bullying-2005-.pdf">Expert
Advisory Group on Workplace Bullying (pdf)</a> reported that bullying is an
increasing problem in the workplace. A survey on bullying was carried out as
recommended by the Group and <a href="http://www.esri.ie/publications/bullying-in-the-workplace-survey-reports-2007/">Bullying
in the Workplace, Survey Reports 2007</a> was published. In many European
countries the term '<a href="https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/observatories/eurwork/industrial-relations-dictionary/mobbing">mobbing</a>'
is used instead of bullying to describe this type of hostile behaviour in the
workplace.</p>

<h3>Employment equality </h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0021/index.html">Employment
Equality Acts 1998-2015</a> place an obligation on all employers to prevent <a shape="rect" href="harassment_at_work.html">harassment in the workplace</a>.
Sexual harassment and harassment on any of the following grounds – civil
status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race or
membership of the Traveller community – are forms of discrimination in
relation to conditions of employment. Bullying which is not linked to one of
the discriminatory grounds above is not covered by the Employment Equality
Acts. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/si/0208.html">Code of
Practice on Sexual Harassment and Harassment at Work</a> aims to give practical
guidance to employers, and employees on how to prevent sexual harassment and
harassment at work and how to put procedures in place to deal with it. </p>

<p>If you are being bullied at work and it is not covered by the Employment
Equality Acts, you may still have legal rights – see ‘How to apply’
below.</p>

<h3>Health and safety at work<br></h3>

<p>Bullying in the workplace can affect both the safety and the health of
employees. Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0010/index.html">Safety,
Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005</a> employers have a duty to ensure the
health and safety of their employees in the workplace. Under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0010/sec0008.html#partii-chapi-sec8">section
8</a> of the Act your employer is required to“prevent any improper conduct or
behaviour likely to put the safety, health and welfare of employees at risk”.
Your duty as an employee is not to engage in improper behaviour which would
endanger the health, safety and welfare of yourself or the other employees. </p>

<p>The Health and Safety Authority works to ensure that workplace bullying is
not tolerated and that employers have procedures for dealing with bullying at
work. It provides <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Workplace_Health/Bullying_at_Work/Bullying_-_Employee_Perspective/">information
and advice on bullying</a> and is responsible for the <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Publications_and_Forms/Publications/Occupational_Health/CoP_Bullying.pdf">Code
of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention and Resolution of
Bullying at Work (pdf).</a> This Code sets out guidance notes for employees,
employers and trade unions on dealing with bullying in the workplace. </p>

<p>Your employer must take reasonable steps to prevent bullying in the
workplace. There should be an anti-bullying policy and established procedures
for dealing with complaints of bullying in the workplace. Your employer should
deal with such complaints immediately. The Workplace Relations Commission has a
<a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Good_Workplace_Relations/codes_practice/COP6/">Code
of Practice detailing Procedures for Addressing Bullying in the
Workplace</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You need to find out <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Workplace_Health/Bullying_at_Work/Are_you_being_Bullied/">what
to do if you feel you are being bullied.</a> The <a href="http://www4.dcu.ie/abc/work.shtml">National Anti-Bullying Research and
Resource Centre</a> can provide guidance on your options. You should begin by
making it very clear to the person concerned that you find their behaviour
unacceptable and undermining. If this informal approach is not enough to
resolve the issue and in situations where the bullying continues, you may need
to consider making a formal complaint. You should report the bullying to a
manager. Your employer's policy on bullying should clearly set out what will
happen when a formal complaint is made, how the complaint will be investigated
and who will carry out the investigation, taking into account issues of
confidentiality and the rights of both parties. </p>

<h3>Complaints</h3>

<p>If you feel that your complaint about bullying has not been dealt with
properly by your employer, you may make a complaint under employment equality
or health and safety legislation to the <a href="../enforcement_and_redress/labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace
Relations Commission</a>. You must use the online complaint form available on
<a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>
and complaints must be brought within 6 months. This time limit can be
increased to 12 months if “reasonable cause” for the delay can be shown </p>

<p><strong>Unfair dismissal:</strong> If the bullying becomes unbearable and
you are forced to leave your job, you may be entitled to claim <a shape="rect" href="../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/constructive_dismissal.html">constructive
dismissal</a> under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977-2007. This means that
although you left your job voluntarily, in reality you were forced to do so
because of the way that you were being treated. It is recommended that you
should obtain legal advice about your rights before leaving your job. If you
qualify under the <a href="../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfair
dismissals legislation</a>, you may make a claim to the Workplace Relations
Commission.</p>

<p><strong>Victimisation:</strong> If you bring a claim under employment
equality, health and safety, or unfair dismissals legislation you cannot then
be subjected to <a shape="rect" href="../enforcement_and_redress/victimisation_at_work.html">victimisation at
work</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Personal injury claim:</strong> If the bullying or harassment at
work is so great that it causes your health (physical or psychological) to
suffer or be affected, you may also be entitled to bring a claim for
compensation for personal injury. You cannot seek compensation from your
employer under the health and safety legislation but you can make a personal
injury claim through <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/civil_law/personal_injuries_assessment_board.html">InjuriesBoard.ie</a>.

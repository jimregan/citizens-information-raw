<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0021/index.html">Employment
Equality Acts 1998-2015</a> place an obligation on all employers to prevent
harassment in the workplace. Under this law, you are entitled to <a href="../enforcement_and_redress/equality_tribunal.html">bring a claim to
the Workplace Relations Commission</a> and your employer may be obliged to pay
you compensation if you are harassed by reason of your: </p>
<ul><li>Gender </li>
  <li>Civil status </li>
  <li>Family status, for example, as a parent of a child </li>
  <li>Sexual orientation </li>
  <li>Age </li>
  <li>Disability </li>
  <li>Race </li>
  <li>Religious belief </li>
  <li>Membership of the Traveller community </li>
</ul><h3>Harassment and sexual harassment</h3>

<p>Harassment based on any of the above grounds is a form of discrimination in
relation to conditions of employment. The Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015
define harassment as “unwanted conduct” which is related to any of the 9
discriminatory grounds above. Sexual harassment is any form of “unwanted
verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature”. In both cases it
is defined as conduct which “has the purpose or effect of violating a
person’s dignity and creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading,
humiliating or offensive environment for the person” and it is prohibited
under the Acts.</p>

<p>The “unwanted conduct” includes spoken words, gestures or the production
and display of written words, pictures and other material. This includes
offensive gestures or facial expressions, unwelcome and offensive calendars,
screen-savers, e-mails and any other offensive material. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="bullying_in_the_workplace.html">Bullying at work</a>
when it is related to one of the discriminatory grounds is covered by the
Employment Equality Acts. Harassment and bullying at work which is not linked
to a discriminatory ground is a <a shape="rect" href="../rights_and_conditions/health_and_safety/health_safety_work.html">health
and safety issue</a> - see 'How to apply' below.</p>

<p>Harassment can be by a fellow worker, your boss or someone in a superior
position, a client, a customer or any other business contact. Harassment can
take place at work or on a training course, on a work trip, at a work social
event or any other occasion connected with your job. </p>

<p>Under the Acts, your employer may also be held responsible if harassment
takes place completely outside the course of your employment but you are
treated differently at work because of your rejection or acceptance of the
harassment. If you bring a claim against your employer for harassment, your
employer may have a defence by showing that he or she took reasonably practical
steps to prevent the harassment from happening or to prevent you from being
treated differently at work. If you bring a claim under the Acts, you cannot
then be subjected to <a shape="rect" href="../enforcement_and_redress/victimisation_at_work.html">victimisation at
work.</a></p>

<p>Your employer should have a policy and procedures to deal with and prevent
harassment at work. The policy should set out what is unacceptable behaviour at
work. An effective grievance or complaints procedure should be in place to deal
with complaints about harassment. All employees must be aware of these policy
and procedures. The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/si/0208.html">Code of Practice on
Sexual Harassment and Harassment at Work</a> aims to give practical guidance to
employers,and employees on how to prevent sexual harassment and harassment at
work and how to put procedures in place to deal with it. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you wish to make a complaint about harassment, you should begin by making
it very clear to the person concerned that you find their behaviour, conduct,
material and so on, unacceptable and offensive. If you find this uncomfortable
or too difficult to do, you should seek support (or for an initial approach to
be made on your behalf) by a sympathetic friend or colleague, a designated
person at work or a trade union representative. Very often, an informal
approach like this will resolve the issue. </p>

<p>Sometimes, an informal approach is not enough to resolve the issue and in
situations where the harassment continues, you may need to consider making a
formal complaint. Your employer's policy on harassment should clearly set out
what will happen when a formal complaint is made, how the complaint will be
investigated and who will carry out the investigation, taking into account
issues of confidentiality and the rights of both parties. </p>

<p>The <a href="../enforcement_and_redress/labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace
Relations Commission</a> investigates and/or mediates disputes in relation to
the implementation of the employment equality legislation. If you feel that
your complaint about harassment on one of the discriminatory grounds has not
been dealt with properly by your employer, you can make a complaint under
employment equality legislation using the <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">online
complaint form available on workplacerelations.ie</a>.</p>

<p>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has a general remit to
promote equality and can give advice and, in some cases, legal assistance if
you wish to bring a claim of harassment under the Employment Equality Acts. </p>

<p>Complaints under the Employment Equality Acts must be brought within 6
months of the last act of harassment. This time limit can be increased to 12
months if “reasonable cause” for the delay can be shown. If a person is
unable to pursue a claim effectively because of an intellectual or
physiological disability a parent, guardian or other person acting on behalf of
the complainant can bring a complaint.</p>

<p>The Health and Safety Authority provides information and advice on <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Workplace_Health/Bullying_at_Work/Are_you_being_Bullied/">bullying
at work.</a> It is responsible for the <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Publications_and_Forms/Publications/Occupational_Health/CoP_Bullying.pdf">Code
of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention and Resolution of
Bullying at Work (pdf)</a>. It aims to ensure that workplace bullying is not
tolerated and that employers have procedures for dealing with bullying at
work.</p>

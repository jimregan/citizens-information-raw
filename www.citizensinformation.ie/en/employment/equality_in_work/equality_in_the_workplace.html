<h2>Information</h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0021/index.html">Employment
Equality Acts 1998–2015</a> outlaw discrimination in a wide range of
employment and employment-related areas. These include recruitment and
promotion; equal pay; working conditions; training or experience; dismissal and
harassment including sexual harassment. The legislation defines discrimination
as treating one person in a less favourable way than another person based on
any of the following 9 grounds:</p>
<ul><li>Gender: this means man, woman or transsexual </li>
  <li>Civil status: includes single, married, separated, divorced, widowed
    people, <a href="../../birth_family_relationships/civil_partnerships/civil_partnership_and_same_sex_couples.html">civil
    partners and former civil partners</a></li>
  <li>Family status: this refers to the parent of a person under 18 years or
    the resident primary carer or parent of a person with a disability </li>
  <li>Sexual orientation: includes gay, lesbian, bisexual and heterosexual </li>
  <li>Religion: means religious belief, background, outlook or none </li>
  <li>Age: this does not apply to a person aged under 16 </li>
  <li>Disability: includes people with physical, intellectual, learning,
    cognitive or emotional disabilities and a range of medical conditions </li>
  <li>Race: includes race, skin colour, nationality or ethnic origin </li>
  <li>Membership of the Traveller community. </li>
</ul><h3>What is discrimination?</h3>

<p>Discrimination is defined as less favourable treatment. An employee is said
to be discriminated against if they are treated less favourably than another
is, has been or would be treated in a comparable situation on any of the above
9 grounds. To establish direct discrimination, a direct comparison must be
made, for example, in the case of disability discrimination the comparison must
be between a person who has a disability and another who has not, or between
persons with different disabilities.</p>

<p>Indirect discrimination occurs when practices or policies that do not appear
to discriminate against one group more than another actually have a
discriminatory impact. It can also happen where a requirement that may appear
non-discriminatory adversely affects a particular group or class of persons.</p>

<h3>Specific situations covered by employment equality legislation</h3>

<p><strong>Disability:</strong> Employers are obliged to make reasonable
accommodations for <a shape="rect" href="../and_disability/working_with_a_disability.html">staff with
disabilities</a>. This includes providing access to employment, enabling people
with disabilities to participate in employment including promotion, and
training.</p>

<p><strong>Pregnancy:</strong> Pregnancy-related discrimination is
discrimination on the ground of gender and includes recruitment, promotion and
general conditions of employment. Women who are pregnant or have recently given
birth are also protected under <a shape="rect" href="../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/maternity_leave.html">maternity
protection</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfair
dismissals</a> legislation.</p>

<p><strong>Equal pay:</strong> Employment equality legislation provides for
equal pay for like work. <em>Like work</em> is defined as work that is the
same, similar or work of equal value. It is one of the terms that must be part
of the <a href="../employment_rights_and_conditions/contracts_of_employment/contract_of_employment.html">contract
of employment</a> as a result of laws passed by the Dail. A claim for equal pay
can be made on any of the 9 grounds listed above.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="harassment_at_work.html"><strong>Harassment</strong>
including sexual harassment</a> that is based on any of the 9 grounds is a form
of discrimination in relation to conditions of employment. <a shape="rect" href="bullying_in_the_workplace.html">Bullying at work</a> which is linked to
one of the 9 discriminatory grounds above comes under employment equality
legislation.</p>

<p><strong>Victimisation:</strong> Under employment equality legisation you are
protected against <a shape="rect" href="../enforcement_and_redress/victimisation_at_work.html">victimisation</a>
if you bring a claim or are involved in a complaint of unlawful discrimination
against your employer. This means that your employer may not penalise you by
dismissal, unfair treatment or an unfavourable change in your conditions of
employment.</p>

<h3>Enforcing your rights</h3>

<p>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Workplace Relations
Commission are separate organisations that work to ensure equality at work.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../justice/law_and_rights/irish_human_rights_commission.html">Irish
Human Rights and Equality Commission</a> is a statutory body set up to provide
information to the public on human rights and equality legislation. It can, at
its discretion, provide legal assistance to people who wish to bring claims to
the Equality Tribunal. You can find the booklet, <a href="http://www.ihrec.ie/publications/list/ihrec-employment-equality-rights-explained/">Your
Employment Equality Rights Explained</a> on ihrec.ie</p>

<p>The <a href="../enforcement_and_redress/labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace
Relations Commission</a> is the place to bring a <a href="../enforcement_and_redress/equality_tribunal.html">discrimation claim
under the Employment Equality Acts 1998–2015</a> using the online complaint
form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>).
It investigates or mediates claims of unlawful discrimination under equality
legislation. </p>

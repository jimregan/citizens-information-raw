<p>If you are changing your job, (that is, leaving your existing job and
commencing a new one), there are a number of steps you should take in relation
to tax and social insurance contributions (<acronym title="Pay-related Social Insurance">PRSI</acronym>). In addition, there are
important issues to be aware of, regarding your pension.</p>

<h3>Statement of tax</h3>

<p>Whenever you leave a job you should get a P45 certificate from your
employer. Your P45 is a statement from your employer that shows your pay, tax,
<a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">Universal
Social Charge (USC)</a>, and PRSI details for the year up to the date you
leave. When you begin work at your new job, you will need this P45 to give to
your new employer. Your new employer then takes some details from your P45 and
then sends your P45 to the tax office on your behalf. This is to notify the tax
office that you have now commenced working for a new employer and ensures that
they are deducting tax appropriately. When you give the P45 to your new
employer, they will:</p>
<ul><li>Operate PAYE in accordance with the tax credits and standard cut off
    point details shown on the P45 until they receives a tax credit certificate
    from the tax office. </li>
  <li>Notify the tax office that you have changed jobs so that a tax credit
    certificate can be issued for your new job. </li>
</ul><p>If you do not give your new employer a P45 certificate, emergency tax will
be deducted.</p>

<h3>Emergency tax</h3>

<p>If your employer has not received either a:</p>
<ul><li>Certificate of tax credits from the tax office or, </li>
  <li>P45 certificate (parts 2 and 3) from you, in respect of your previous
    employment, </li>
</ul><p>your employer will be obliged to deduct tax on an emergency basis when
paying your employee's wages or salary. This means that they will give you a
temporary tax credit for the first month of employment but tax deductions are
increased progressively from the second month onwards. The effect of emergency
basis is that after 4 weeks, no tax credits are given and tax is paid at the
higher rate from week 9, regardless of the level of pay. It makes sense
therefore to avoid the emergency basis by following the simple steps outlined
earlier when you start work in Ireland. <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/paye/guide/employers-guide-paye-calculation.html#section8">Details
of emergency tax rates</a> are on the Revenue website.</p>

<h3>Social insurance (PRSI)</h3>

<p>Most employers and employees (over 16 years of age) pay social insurance
contributions into the national Social Insurance Fund. Social insurance
contributions entitle you to a range of benefits that are administered by the
Department of Social Protection. It is important therefore to inform your new
employer of your <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">Personal
Public Service Number (PPS number)</a> as this will ensure that your combined
social welfare contributions are recorded and that your entitlement to benefits
is protected for the future. You can find more information in our document
about <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social
insurance (PRSI)</a>. </p>

<h3>Changing jobs and pensions</h3>

<p><strong>Occupational pensions:</strong> If you have an <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/occupational_pensions.html">occupational
pension</a> your benefits from the pension scheme may be preserved within the
scheme or transferred to another scheme. Legislation requires that when a
member leaves a scheme that they must be provided with a Leaving Service
Options letter within 2 months of their exit from the scheme. This letter
should detail any options relating to the members’ benefits. A preserved
benefit means that you get a pension when you reach the scheme's normal
retirement age. </p>

<p>If you have less than 2 years' contributions to the scheme, you can get a
refund of your own contributions (but not any contributions made by your
employer). This refund will be taxed, as you received tax relief when you made
the contribution. Before you leave your employment, you should talk to the
person in the company who has responsibilty for administering the pension
scheme, as each scheme has its own rules.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSA):</strong> If you have a
<a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/personal_retirement_savings_accounts.html">PRSA</a>
you can stop or start it when you choose, without charges, by contacting your
PRSA provider. Your PRSA is a contract between you and a PRSA provider in the
form of an investment account. PRSAs allow you to change employment and
continue to use the same PRSA. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Getting your first job or moving from one job to another, as well as losing
your job, are major events in your life. At such times, you may need
information to help guide you through the process and to help you make the
right choices. </p>

<p>Whether you are a <a shape="rect" href="finding_and_getting_a_job.html">jobseeker looking for employment,</a>
changing jobs, facing redundancy or simply want to know more about your rights,
there is a wide range of information relating to employment. The Department of
Social Protection offers a range of <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/employment_supports.html">employment
services</a> to jobseekers.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are returning to employment after a significant gap, there are a
number of options to consider and steps you should take before you start work.
You may need help with finding a job or you may be interested in <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/vocational_education_and_training/">further
training before starting work</a>. Your local Intreo Centre can advise you
about job opportunities - see 'Where to apply' below. You can also check <a href="https://www.jobsireland.ie/#/home">Jobs Ireland online for details of job
vacancies and training courses.</a> The Department of Social Protection is
responsible for providing employment services and guidance to jobseekers as
well as income support. </p>

<p>You can use a new <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Benefit-of-Work-Ready-Reckoner-Introduction.aspx">Benefit
of Work Ready Reckoner</a> from the Department of Social Protection to help you
assess out the financial consequences of taking up full-time work. The Reckoner
works out the total amount you would receive on taking up full-time work
(including any Family Income Supplement) and compares this to what you are
getting in jobseeker payments (including Rent Supplement).</p>

<h3>Intreo - the integrated employment and support service</h3>

<p>Intreo, the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Intreo.aspx">new service
from the Department of Social Protection</a>, provides a single point of
contact for all employment and income supports. Details of locations are
published on <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Intreo---Contact-Information.aspx">welfare.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>Other supports</h3>

<p>If you are unemployed you may be able to retain your medical card or Rent
Supplement when you take up employment - see below. If you have been unemployed
for some time and still have not found a job you may be eligible for an <a href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/">employment
scheme.</a> There are <a href="../../employment_and_disability/">employment
supports for people with disabilities.</a> </p>

<p><strong>If you have children:</strong></p>
<ul><li>You may be eligible for a <a href="https://m.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Continued-Child-Payment.aspx">13-week
    continued payment of the Increase for a Qualified Child</a>. Alternatively,
    if you are taking up a low-paid job, you may qualify for <a shape="rect" href="../../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
    Income Supplement (FIS)</a> </li>
  <li><p>The <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/back_to_work_family_dividend.html">Back
    to Work Family Dividend</a> is available for lone parent and long-term
    jobseeker families with children who find or return to work. It can be paid
    in addition to FIS. </p>
  </li>
  <li>A number of <a href="../../../education/pre_school_education_and_childcare/your_childcare_options.html">affordable
    childcare schemes</a> provide childcare for families on lower incomes and
    aim to support parents to return to work or education.</li>
</ul><h3>Tax and PRSI</h3>

<p>If you are returning to employment after a significant gap, you need to
ensure that your tax and PRSI deductions from your wages are correct. </p>

<p><strong>Tax<br></strong>Your new employer must deduct tax and <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">the
Universal Social Charge (USC)</a> from your pay under the PAYE system from the
beginning of your employment. To make sure that your tax is properly dealt with
from the start and that your employer deducts the right amount of tax from your
pay, you should do the following:</p>
<ul><li>Give your employer your <a shape="rect" href="../../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">Personal
    Public Service Number (PPS number)</a> and ask for your Employer's
    Registered Number. If you do not know your PPS number, contact your Intreo
    Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office and staff there can find your number
    for you.</li>
  <li>Register the details of your new job with <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/jobs-pensions.html">Revenue’s Jobs
    and Pensions online service</a> in <a href="https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html">myAccount</a>. If you are
    unable to use online services, you can contact your tax office for
    assistance – see ‘Where to apply’ below.</li>
</ul><p>Ideally you should take these steps as soon as you accept an offer of a job,
even if only a part-time or holiday employment. This will give your employment
and the tax office time to get things sorted out before your first pay day. </p>

<p>When you have registered the details of your new job, Revenue will send your
employer a tax credit certificate showing the tax credits that your employer
deducts from your tax bill. You can view your tax credit certificate and claim
any additional tax credits you may be due through Revenue's PAYE Anytime
service. You access PAYE Anytime through Revenue's myAccount.</p>

<p>If you have not sorted out your tax position by the time you start work your
employer will have to <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/paye/guide/employers-guide-paye-calculation.html#section8">deduct
tax on an emergency basis</a><em>.</em></p>

<p><strong>PRSI<br></strong>Providing your employer with your PPS number will allow your social
welfare contributions to be recorded along with any contributions you paid in
previous periods of employment.</p>

<p>If you have been out of the workforce for some years, you will not qualify
for short-term social welfare payments such as <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">Illness
Benefit</a> immediately. You are, however, immediately covered for Injury
Benefit, where you are unable to work due to an accident at work. How quickly
you will qualify for the various social welfare benefits will depend on the
type of benefit you are applying for and your circumstances before returning to
work. You gain <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">credited
contributions</a> if, for example, you are sick or unemployed. </p>

<h3>Retention of medical card and Rent Supplement</h3>

<p><strong>Medical card<br></strong>If you are unemployed and you are returning to full-time or part-time
work, you can keep your medical card for 3 years provided you have been getting
one of the following allowances or benefits for 12 months or more:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker's
    Benefit</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
    Allowance</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent
    Family Payment</a> </li>
  <li><a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">Illness
    Benefit </a></li>
  <li><a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/invalidity_pension.html">Invalidity
    Pension</a></li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability
    Allowance</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/blind_persons_pension.html">Blind
    Pension</a> or </li>
  <li>Have been on an employment incentive scheme or educational opportunity
    scheme </li>
</ul><p>If you take up full-time employment you will retain your medical card for 3
years from the date you start work. If you take up part-time employment the
3-year period starts from the date your income exceeds the relevant medical
card guideline. There are further details about the retention of medical cards
in the Health Service Executive's <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/mc/forms/medicalcardguidelines2015.pdf">Medical
Card/GP Visit National Assessment Guidelines (pdf)</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Rent Supplement</strong><br>
If you have been unemployed or not in full-time employment for at least 12
months and are assessed as in need of housing under the <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/local_authority_and_social_housing/rental_accommodation_scheme.html">Rental
Accommodation Scheme</a> you may be entitled to retain your <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent

<p>When you are looking for a job there is a range of information sources and
supports to help you in your search. You may looking for a job for the first
time after leaving school or college or you may be thinking of changing job or
returning to work. If you are unemployed, there are a number of services and
supports to help you find work – see below. Whether you are currently in
work, unemployed or in education, the process of finding and applying for a job
is the same. It is important to research all possible sources of information on
employment opportunities, to send in a well-prepared job application with a
relevant CV (curriculum vitae) and, if your application is not successful, to
continue the search for employment. Alternatively you should also look at other
options such as <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/returning_to_education/">returning to education</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../../types_of_employment/self_employment/">self-employment</a>. If you
are coming from outside Ireland to work you can find more information in our
document, <a shape="rect" href="../../migrant_workers/finding_a_job_when_you_move_to_ireland.html">Finding
a job in Ireland</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lba039">Sources of information</h2>

<p>To begin your job search you need to identify the different places where
jobs are advertised. You should check all the sources listed below regularly to
ensure you are aware of any new vacancies. The main ones are: </p>
<ul><li><strong></strong><strong>Your local Intreo centre/employment services
    office</strong> – see ‘Where to apply’ below – provides <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Employment-Advice-and-Support.aspx">information
    and advice for jobseekers</a> including a list of job vacancies and a <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/Jobseeker-Pack.pdf">Jobseeker
    Information Pack (pdf)</a>. Intreo is a new service from the Department of
    Social Protection which provides a single point of contact for all
    employment and income supports. You can read more in our document about <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/employment_supports.html">employment
    services for jobseekers.</a></li>
  <li><strong>Websites:</strong> The <a href="http://www.jobsireland.ie/">Jobs
    Ireland website</a> lists jobs available in Ireland and abroad. It also
    lists internships and employment programme vacancies. You can input your CV
    to the Jobs Ireland database using the website. Employers can access these
    CVs through this database and contact a jobseeker directly. </li>
  <li><strong>Newspapers:</strong> Classified jobs sections of national and
    local newspapers </li>
  <li><strong>Recruitment agencies:</strong> You will find them listed in the
    telephone directory or by doing an online search. There are specialist
    recruitment agencies if you are looking for a particular type of job. </li>
  <li><strong>Notices:</strong> Jobs are often advertised in shop and
    restaurant windows, in libraries, supermarkets and other community
    noticeboards </li>
  <li><strong>Companies:</strong> As vacancies are often only advertised on a
    company website, you should check those which are relevant to your area of
    work </li>
  <li><strong>Personal contacts:</strong> Friends or relatives may know of job
    opportunities </li>
</ul><p><strong>The Citizens Information website does not carry any information
about job vacancies for any sector of the Irish economy. It does not accept
CVs/resumés and cannot forward them to employers on your behalf.</strong> </p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lc2d1a">Applying for a job</h2>

<p>Your CV or resumé is a very important document. It is a summary of your
personal details, educational qualifications and work experience. It should
also include your key skills and other relevant information together with the
names of 2 people who will provide a reference for you. </p>

<p>When you identify a job vacancy, contact the employer to get further details
about it and the company. You should update your CV and send it with a letter
or application form as specified in the job advertisement. The information in
your CV and application letter or form should focus on the specific
requirements of the job. If you are called for a job interview it is important
to prepare for it.</p>

<p>If you are unemployed, your local employment service (LES) or Job Club can
assist you with writing CVs and job applications and with training in interview
skills – see ‘Other supports’ below.</p>

<p><strong>Employment equality:</strong> You are protected by employment
equality legislation when you are applying for a job as well as when you are in
employment. So if you are applying for a job it is unlawful for your
prospective employer to discriminate against you on any of the 9 grounds such
as race or family status. There is more information about this in our document
about the <a href="../../../justice/law_and_rights/irish_human_rights_commission.html">Irish
Human Rights and Equality Commission.</a></p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l375aa">Sources of help</h2>

<p><strong>Long-term unemployed people:</strong> There is a range of <a href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/">employment
support schemes</a> which encourage long-term unemployed people to return to
work. They are aimed at people who have been on unemployment or certain other
social welfare payments for a specific period of time. </p>

<p>Some schemes, such as <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy_support_schemes/community_employment_scheme.html">Community
Employment</a> provide community-based employment opportunities. Other schemes
such as the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_and_work/back_to_work_enterprise_allowance.html">Back
to Work Enterprise Allowance</a> allow people on certain social welfare
payments to take up self-employment while retaining some of their payment. <a href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/national_internship_scheme.html">JobBridge</a>
internships provide work experience opportunities. </p>

<h3>Other supports<br></h3>

<p><strong>Local employment services – Obair (LES)</strong> were set up to
help long-term unemployed people find work. They operate generally through
partnership companies and provide mediators who help with the job search and
liaise with local employers. <a href="http://www.localemploymentservices.ie/">LES </a> also provide guidance
counselling to look at training options and employment schemes. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Jobs-Clubs.aspx">Job Clubs</a>
provide training and support for jobseekers by assisting with preparing CVs,
training in interview skills and with the search for a job. They also provide
‘drop in’ services and formal workshops lasting from 1 to 4 weeks. To
attend a formal workshop you must be a jobseeker who has been referred by an
employment services office or a local employment service. You may get €20 per
week to help with any additional costs you incur while attending the formal
workshops. </p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Training-Support-Grant.aspx">Training
Support Grant (TSG)</a> is available to jobseekers and people getting certain
other payments. The TSG provides quick access to short-term training that is
not immediately available from a State provider or that will help you get a job
quickly. Your case officer can approve a grant under this scheme if it meets
your identified needs (for example, as set out in your Personal Progression
Plan) and is not available from another State provider. </p>

Unemployed.</a></p>

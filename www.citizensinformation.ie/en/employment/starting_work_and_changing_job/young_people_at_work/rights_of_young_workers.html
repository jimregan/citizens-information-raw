<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0016/index.html">Protection
of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996</a> is designed to protect the health of
young workers and ensure that work carried out during school years does not put
young people's education at risk. The Act sets minimum age limits for
employment, rest intervals and maximum working hours and prohibits the
employment of anyone under 18 on late night work. The Act also requires
employers to keep specified records for workers under 18. <br></p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The Act generally applies to employees under 18 years of age. It defines
children as being aged under 16 and young persons refers to those aged 16 and
17. You can read more information in our document on <a shape="rect" href="hours_of_work_for_young_people.html">working hours and rest breaks for
children and young people</a>.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>Under the Act, employers cannot employ children aged under 16 in regular
full-time jobs. Children aged 14 and 15 may be employed as follows: </p>
<ul><li>Doing light work during the school holidays – they must have at least
    21 days off work during this time </li>
  <li>As part of an approved work experience or educational programme where the
    work is not harmful to their health, safety or development </li>
  <li>In film, cultural, advertising work or sport under <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/What_You_Should_Know/Employment_of_Children_and_Young_Persons/">licences
    issued by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</a> </li>
</ul><p>Children aged 15 may do 8 hours a week light work in school term time. The
maximum working week for children outside school term time is 35 hours or up to
40 hours if they are on approved work experience. </p>

<h3>Young people</h3>

<p>The maximum working week for young people aged 16 and 17 is 40 hours with a
maximum of 8 hours a day. If a young person under 18 works for more than one
employer, the combined daily or weekly hours of work cannot exceed the maximum
number of hours allowed. Young persons are only permitted to work between 6am
and 10pm. Any exceptions to this rule must be provided by regulation – see
‘Licensed premises' below.</p>

<h3>Licensed premises</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/si/0350.html">Protection of Young
Persons Act 1996 (Employment in Licensed Premises) Regulations 2001</a> permit
young people employed on general duties in a licensed premises to be required
to work up to 11pm on a day that does not immediately precede a school day
during a school term where the young person is attending school. </p>

<p>Employers who employ young persons to carry out general duties in a licensed
premises must have regard to the <a href="http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Code_of_Practice_-_Employment_of_Young_Persons_in_Licensed_Premises.pdf">Code
of Practice concerning the Employment of Young Persons in Licensed Premises
(pdf).</a></p>

<h3>Evidence of age and the written permission of parents</h3>

<p>Employers must see a copy of the young person's birth certificate or other
evidence of his or her age before employing that person. If the young person is
under 16, the employer must get the written permission of the person's parent
or guardian. </p>

<h3>Payment of wages</h3>

<p>All employees are entitled by law to a payslip. A pay slip is essentially a
statement in writing from the employer to the employee that outlines the total
pay before tax and all details of any deductions from pay. You should find out
information about the <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/pay_slip.html">items your
payslip should contain</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/how_your_tax_is_calculated.html">how
your tax is calculated here</a>.</p>

<p>Since 1 January 2017, the <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/pay_inc_min_wage.html">national
minimum wage</a> is €9.25 per hour. This does not mean that everyone is
automatically entitled to receive this. Young people aged under 18 are
<span>only guaranteed up to 70%</span> of the national minimum wage which is
€6.48 per hour. Your employer is, of course, free to pay you more than the
minimum wage if they wish, but you should be aware that they are not required
to do so by law.</p>

<p>If you are working in a job where staff are given tips/gratuities by
customers (i.e, restaurants, bars, etc.) there is nothing in law to state you
are automatically entitled to these tips. However, the law does not require you
to hand these tips to your employer either. Instead, it all depends on the
custom and practice in your workplace. </p>

<p>If all tips are collected by management and paid to staff through the
payroll, then these tips are subject to tax in the normal way. </p>

<h3>Records to be kept by employers</h3>

<p>Employers must keep records for every employee under 18 that contain the
following information:</p>
<ul><li>The employee's full name </li>
  <li>The employee's date of birth </li>
  <li>The employee's starting and finishing times for work </li>
  <li>The wage rate and total wages paid to the employee. </li>
</ul><p>The employer must keep these records for at least 3 years. </p>

<h3>Summary of the Act</h3>

<p>Employers must give employees aged under 18 years a copy of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/si/3/made/en/print">official
summary of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act,</a> along with
other details of their terms of employment within one month of taking up a job.
Employers with employees under 18 must also display the official summary of the
Act at a place in their workplace where it can be easily read. </p>

<h3>Penalties under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act</h3>

<p>Employers found guilty of an offence under the Act are liable on summary
conviction to a fine of up to €1,904.61. Continuing breaches of the Act can
attract a fine of up to €317.43 a day. </p>

<h3>Continuing education and training</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.tusla.ie/">Tusla</a> is responsible for ensuring that
every child either <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/attendance_and_discipline_in_schools/school_attendance.html">attends
school or otherwise receives a minimum education.</a> One of its duties is to
set up and maintain a register of young persons aged 16 and 17 who leave school
early to take up employment and to make arrangements for their <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/vocational_education_and_training/">continuing education and
training</a> in consultation with providers and employers.</p>

<p>Complaints in relation to infringements of the Protection of Young Persons
(Employment) Act 1996 may be referred to the <a shape="rect" href="../../enforcement_and_redress/national_employment_rights_authority.html">Inspection
Services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC)</a>.</p>

<p>If a child or a young person thinks they have been penalised for refusing to
co-operate with an employer in breaching the Act (for example, by refusing to
work prohibited hours) then a parent or guardian may make a complaint to a <a shape="rect" href="../../enforcement_and_redress/rights_commissioner.html">WRC
adjudicator</a>. Complaints should be within 6 months of such penalisation. You
can make a complaint using the online complaint form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.
This period may be extended by a further 6 months if the Workplace is satisfied
that a reasonable cause prevented the presentation of the complaint within the
first 6 months.</p>

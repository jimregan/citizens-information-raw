<p>Most employees pay tax through the <span>PAYE </span>(Pay As You Earn)
system. This means that your employer deducts the tax you owe directly from
your wages, and pays this tax directly to Revenue. Revenue collect taxes from
citizens on behalf of the Irish Government.</p>

<p>You will also pay <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">PRSI</a>
and the <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">Universal
Social Charge</a> on your income.</p>

<h3>Starting work</h3>

<p>It is important to ensure that your tax is dealt with properly from the
start and that your new employer deducts the right amount of tax from your pay.
To ensure that this happens, you will need to do two things: </p>
<ul><li><span>Give your employer your</span> <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">Personal
    Public Service Number (PPS number)</a>. This number is your unique personal
    identification number for public services. Your employer will then let your
    tax office know that you have started work and that they are your
    employers. Read more about how to obtain a PPS number under 'How to apply'
    below. </li>
  <li><span>Register the details of your new job with <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/jobs-pensions.html">Revenue’s Jobs
    and Pensions online service</a> in <a href="https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html">myAccount</a></span> –
    see 'How to apply' below. </li>
</ul><p>To ensure that your employer and the tax office have time to have everything
sorted out before your first payday, it is advisable to do all this as soon as
you accept an offer of a job (even for part-time or holiday employment). </p>

<h3>Tax credits</h3>

<p>Tax credits reduce the amount of income tax that you have to pay. Your gross
tax is calculated depending on your income. Tax credits are then deducted from
the gross tax to give the amount of tax that you have to pay.</p>

<p>Tax credits consist of various credits and reliefs which you may be able to
claim, depending on your circumstances. Every individual can claim a personal
tax credit for example, and you can also claim relief for items such as the One
Parent Family Credit. </p>

<p>When you have registered the details of your new job, Revenue will send your
employer a tax credit certificate showing the tax credits that your employer
deducts from your tax bill. You can view your tax credit certificate and claim
any additional tax credits you may be due through Revenue's PAYE Anytime
service. You access PAYE Anytime through Revenue's <a href="https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html">myAccount Service</a>. </p>

<p>Details of all the main tax allowances and reliefs are given on the
explanatory leaflet available from your tax office or <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/leaflets/it1.htm">online from revenue.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>What do I have to pay tax on?</h3>

<p>Tax is payable on earnings of all kinds that result from your employment
(including for example, bonuses, overtime, non-cash pay or <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/taxation_of_benefits_from_employment.html">benefit-in-kind</a>
such as the use of company car, tips or Christmas boxes. You do not pay tax on:
scholarship income, interest from savings certificates, savings bonds and
national instalment savings schemes, and payments to approved pension schemes.
</p>

<p>Pay that you receive through working extra hours (overtime) or bonuses, is
included as part of your taxable pay for that week or month. You do not get any
additional tax-free allowances against these additional earnings. </p>

<h3>Emergency tax</h3>

<p>If your employer has not received either a: </p>
<ul><li>Certificate of tax credits from the tax office or, </li>
  <li>Form P45 (parts 2 and 3) from you, in respect of your previous
    employment, </li>
</ul><p>your employer will be obliged to deduct tax on an emergency basis when
paying your wages or salary. This means that they will give you a temporary tax
credit for the first month of employment but tax deductions are increased
progressively from the second month onwards. The effect of emergency basis is
that after 4 weeks no tax credits are given, and tax is paid at the higher rate
from week 9, regardless of the level of pay. It makes sense therefore to avoid
the emergency basis by following the simple steps outlined earlier when you
start work. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/paye/guide/employers-guide-paye-calculation.html#section8">Details
of emergency tax rates are available on the Revenue website.</a></p>

<h3>Income tax bands</h3>

<p>Income tax bands will determine the rate of tax you pay on your income or
salary. Read more about <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/how_your_tax_is_calculated.html">how your
tax is calculated here</a>.</p>

<p>More detailed information regarding tax credits and reliefs is available
from <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/cont_main.htm">your tax
office</a>. </p>

<h3>Starting a second job</h3>

<p>If you choose to take on a second job, your first employer will already have
instructions from the tax office to give you all the tax credits to which you
are entitled against your pay. Unless you advise your tax office to issue new
certificates, one to each employer, dividing the tax credits and standard rate
cut-off point between the two jobs, your new employer (that is, in your second
job) will operate your pay on an emergency tax basis.</p>

<p>This will mean that you would get more tax credits than you are entitled to,
resulting in an underpayment of tax, which will have to be paid at the end of
the tax year. </p>

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The term <em>domestic worker</em> refers to people employed to carry out
various duties in a private home. Generally they are engaged directly by
homeowners to carry out these tasks. The type of work domestic workers normally
carry out include housekeeping and cleaning. Other duties may include the care
of children, older people or people with disabilities. Domestic workers can
work part-time or full-time and sometimes (but not always) live with their
employer. Care assistants and <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/care_in_your_community/home_helps.html">home helps</a> are
domestic workers. You can read this leaflet on the <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Domestic-Workers-in-Ireland.pdf">employment
rights of domestic workers (pdf)</a>. </p>

<p>Many of those employed as domestic workers are migrant workers – often
from outside the European Economic Area (EEA). These employees require <a href="../migrant_workers/employment_permits/overview_employment_permits.html">employment
permits</a> in order to work in Ireland. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Good_Workplace_Relations/codes_practice/COP10/">Code
of Practice for Protecting Persons Employed in Other People's Homes</a> states
the entitlement of domestic workers to the employment rights and protections
available to other employees and the employers' obligation to inform these
employees of their rights. In July 2014, the Government decided to <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/News-And-Events/Department-News/2014/July/Minister-Bruton-announces-ratification-of-ILO-Convention-on-Decent-Work-for-Domestic-Workers-.html">ratify
the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention on Decent Work for
Domestic Workers.</a> </p>

<p>If you work occasionally in someone’s home as a cleaner or carer, you may
not be employed as a domestic worker – see 'Paying tax, USC and PRSI for a
domestic worker' below. Instead, you may be either employed by an agency (where
you are an agency worker) or you may be <a shape="rect" href="../self_employment/self_employment_as_an_individual.html">self-employed</a>.
If you are self-employed you are responsible for paying your own taxes and are
not covered by employment rights legislation. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lc4e95">Employment rights</h2>

<p>People working in other people’s home have broadly the same employment
rights as other workers. However sometimes employers and employees may not be
fully aware of these rights.</p>

<p>Access to employment is the only area where the rights of domestic workers
differ from those of other workers. It is illegal to discriminate against
prospective employees when hiring them (for example, at the interview and
selection stage). The only exception is when the job is to be carried out in
someone’s home. In this case it is not illegal to discriminate against a
prospective domestic employee at the interview and selection stage. For
example, an employer could state that they are looking for a woman to look
after children without being considered discriminatory. However once the
employee has taken up the job they are fully protected by <a href="../equality_in_work/equality_in_the_workplace.html">employment
equality</a> legislation.</p>

<h3>Contract of employment</h3>

<p>Domestic workers have a right to a written <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/contracts_of_employment/contract_of_employment.html">contract
of employment</a> which states the terms and conditions of their employment and
must include the full names of the employer and the employee and the job title
or nature of the work, the pay, hours of work. These conditions cannot be
changed without the agreement of the worker. </p>

<h3>Wages and tax</h3>

<p>Domestic workers are also entitled to a <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/pay_inc_min_wage.html">minimum
wage</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/pay_slip.html">a
payslip</a>. If they work on Sundays, they are entitled to extra pay or paid
time off work. Domestic workers should pay tax, PRSI and the Universal Social
Charge (USC) in the same way as other employees and it is the responsibility of
the employer to deduct this from the worker’s wages and also to pay the
employer’s PRSI contribution on their behalf - see 'Paying tax, USC and PRSI
for a domestic worker' below.</p>

<p><strong>Deductions from wages</strong></p>

<p>If the employee is given bed and board as part of their employment the
employer can deduct this from their wages. However the deduction must be fair
and reasonable, it must be stated in the employee’s contract of employment
and the employee must be given written notice of the deduction. The following
amounts for food (known as board) and/or accommodation (known as lodgings)
provided by the employer are included in the minimum wage calculation:</p>

<p><strong>Full board and lodging:</strong> €54.13 a week or €7.73 per
day<br><strong>Full board only:</strong> €32.14 a week or €4.60 per day<br><strong>Lodgings only:</strong> €21.85 or €3.14 per day</p>

<p>Deductions for other reasons, such as breakages or loss to the employer,
must meet similar criteria. The contract must state that these deductions can
be made, the deduction must be fair and the employer must give the employee
written notice of the deduction. </p>

<p><strong>Sick pay:</strong> Workers do not have a statutory (legal) right to
sick pay but their contract (terms and conditions of employment) should state
the procedure the employee should follow if <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/sick_leave.html">unable to
work due to illness</a> and the arrangements for pay during this time. </p>

<h3>Hours of work</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/hours_of_work/working_week.html">maximum
hours of work</a> that an employee can work in a week is 48 hours on average.
The employer must keep a record of how many hours a domestic worker is
employed. Domestic workers have a right to 11 consecutive hours rest in any
24-hour period and 24 consecutive hours rest every week. They also have a right
to a 15-minute break after 4 ½ hours of work and a 30-minute break after 6
hours of work. </p>

<h3>Dignity and privacy</h3>

<p>The Code of Practice provides that the employer should respect the dignity
and privacy of the employee. If the employee is required to live in the home,
the employer should provide a private secure room with a bed. If employees are
required to share a room this should be agreed in advance. Employers should
make it easy for the employees to exercise their personal pursuits outside the
employees' working time.</p>

<p>The Code of Practice also provides that the employer should not withhold
personal documents of the employee such as a passport or visa, nor prevent the
employee from joining a trade union.</p>

<h3>Annual leave and public holidays</h3>

<p>Full-time workers have the right to <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/annual_leave_public_holidays.html">4
weeks’ paid leave</a> a year (this is the legal minimum and can be more).
They also have the right to take 2 unbroken weeks’ holiday and to ask for
payment for the time off in advance. There are 9 <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/public_holidays_in_ireland.html">public
holidays</a> and domestic workers have the right to be paid for these days or
to have another paid day off instead or an extra day’s pay. If the worker
travels with their employer on holiday, this is considered to be work<em></em>
and the employee is entitled to full pay for this time. </p>

<h3>Employment records</h3>

<p>Employers are required to keep certain records relating to their employees.
This is to show that they are compliant with employment legislation. <a href="../enforcement_and_redress/labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace
Relations Commission</a> inspectors will require access to these records during
an inspection. You can find a <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/WRC_Guide_to_Inspections_.pdf">guide
to how inspections are carried out (pdf)</a> on workplacerelations.ie.</p>

<h3>Dismissal and notice</h3>

<p>Workers are entitled to a <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/losing_your_job/losing_job_entitlements.html">minimum
amount of notice if their employment ceases</a>. Workers are also protected
against <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfair
dismissal</a> once they have been working for their employer for over a year.
They are protected against unfair dismissal when they have worked for less than
a year if the dismissal relates to specific activity such as trade union
membership, pregnancy or entitlement to the minimum wage. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>Complaints about employment rights and equality should be made to Workplace
Relations Commission. You must use the online complaint form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.</p>

<p>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) campaigns to inform domestic
workers of their rights and can provide information about trade unions. There
is an <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ictu.ie/download/pdf/domestic_english.pdf">ICTU booklet on the
rights of domestic workers (pdf).</a> Many domestic workers are migrants and
the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland provides support to migrant workers.</p>

<h2 class="further_info" id="l9bda1">Paying tax, USC and PRSI for a domestic worker</h2>

<p>Domestic workers should pay tax, USC and PRSI in the same way as other
employees. If you are employing someone to do domestic work such as
housekeeping, care of children or older people, and you are paying them €40 a
week or more, you must <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/paye/guide/employers-guide-paye-registration.html">register
as an employer</a> with Revenue. As an employer you are responsible for
deducting the PAYE (tax), PRSI and USC from your employee’s wages. You also
must pay <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/employer_s_duty_to_pay_social_insurance_prsi.html">employer's
PRSI contributions</a> for your employee to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">Social
Insurance Fund.</a></p>

<p>To register as an individual employer for PAYE and PRSI you do this using <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/ros/index.html">Revenue’s online
service</a>. Certain people can only register on paper using the tax
registration form <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vat/forms/formtr1.pdf">TR1 (pdf)</a> and you
can find information about them <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/eregistration/index.html">here</a>. You
will receive confirmation that you are registered as an employer together with
your employer registered number for PAYE purposes and information about the
PAYE system and procedures. </p>

<p>Revenue's <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/paye/guide/index.html">Employer’s
Guide to PAYE</a> includes sections on <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/paye/guide/employers-guide-paye-recommencing.html">new
employees,</a> <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/paye/guide/employers-guide-paye-tax-due.html">calculating
tax due</a> and <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/paye/guide/employers-guide-paye-prsi.html">PRSI.</a>
When you are paying your employee you must provide a <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/pay_slip.html">payslip</a>
giiving details of the PAYE, PRSI and USC that has been deducted. </p>

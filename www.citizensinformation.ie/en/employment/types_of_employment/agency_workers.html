<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>An agency worker is a person who has an agreement with an agency to work for
another person. For example, a secretary may have an agreement with a
secretarial agency to do work for an office while one of their employees is on
leave. While agency workers do not have all the same employment rights as
regular workers, under the EU Directive on Temporary Agency Work (see below)
temporary agency workers have the right to equal treatment in basic working and
employment conditions. This Directive was transposed into Irish legislation by
the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0013/index.html">Protection
of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012</a> (see below). Agency workers
are also protected under other employment legislation see ‘Other
legislation’ below.</p>

<h3>EU Directive on Temporary Agency Work </h3>

<p>The <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32008L0104&amp;from=EN">EU
Directive on Temporary Agency Work 2008/104/EC (pdf)</a> came into effect on 5
December 2011. It provides that all temporary agency workers must have equal
treatment with regular workers from their first day at work in respect of:</p>
<ul><li>The duration of working time, rest periods, night work, annual leave and
    public holidays </li>
  <li>Pay </li>
  <li>Work done by pregnant women and nursing mothers, children and young
    people </li>
  <li>Action taken to combat discrimination on the grounds of sex, race or
    ethnic origin, religion or beliefs, disabilities, age or sexual
    orientation. </li>
</ul><p>Temporary agency workers must also have equal access to facilities such as
childcare and must be informed of permanent employment opportunities.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l5ab5c">Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency
Work) Act 2012</h2>

<p>The Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012 transposing
this EU Directive into Irish legislation was signed into law on 16 May 2012. It
provides that all temporary agency workers must have equal treatment as if they
had been directly recruited by the hirer from their first day at work.</p>

<h3>Who is covered by this Act?</h3>

<p>The Act applies to agency workers employed by an employment agency who are
temporarily assigned to work for, and under the supervision and direction of,
another organisation (the hirer).</p>

<h3>Who is not covered by the Act?</h3>

<p>The Act does not cover employees of contractor companies and limited
liability companies where the worker is the beneficial owner. The Act may also
exclude those employed under a managed service contract, which is a contract
for services, for example, cleaning, where the contractor is responsible for
managing and delivering the service.</p>

<p>The Act does not apply to work done on the Work Placement Scheme, JobBridge
or any publicly-funded vocational training or re-training scheme specified by
the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>

<h3>Employment and working conditions</h3>

<p>Since 16 May 2012 temporary agency workers covered by the Act have the right
to the same basic employment conditions as if they had been directly employed
by the hirer under a contract of employment. <strong>The right to equal pay has
retrospective effect to 5 December 2011</strong>. These employment and working
conditions are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Working time</strong></p>

<p>This includes the duration of working time, rest periods, breaks, night
work, annual leave and public holidays</p>

<p><strong>Pay</strong></p>

<p>This is defined as basic pay, shift premium, piece work, overtime, unsocial
hours worked, and Sunday work. The definition of pay in the Act does not
include occupational pension schemes, sick pay, bonuses, maternity pay or
benefit in kind. The right to equal pay is backdated to 5 December 2011.</p>

<p><strong>Derogation:</strong> If the agency worker has a permanent contract
with the agency and is paid between assignments, equal treatment as regards pay
does not apply.</p>

<p><strong>Access to facilities:</strong> Temporary agency workers must have
equal access to facilities such as childcare, canteen and car parking. They
also must have equal access to information about permanent employment
opportunities.</p>

<p>The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has published <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Guide_to_Protection_of_Employees_Temporary_Agency_Work_Act.pdf">guidance
on the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012 (pdf).</a> </p>

<h3>Penalisation</h3>

<p>An agency worker is protected against being <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/victimisation_at_work.html">victimised</a>
for reporting breaches of the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work)
Act 2012. This means that the hirer or the agency may not penalise an agency
worker by dismissal, unfair treatment or an unfavourable change in their
conditions of employment.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l4d398">Other legislation</h2>

<p>Agency workers also have certain rights under the following employment
legislation:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1977/en/act/pub/0010/index.html">Unfair
    Dismissals Acts 1977–2007</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1967/en/act/pub/0021/index.html">Redundancy
    Payments Acts 1967–2014</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1967/en/act/pub/0021/index.html">Minimum
    Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973–2005</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/index.html">Organisation
    of Working Time Act 1997</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0025/index.html">Payment
    of Wages Act 1991</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0034/index.html">Maternity
    Protection Acts 1994 and 2004</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0021/index.html">Employment
    Equality Acts 1998–2015</a> </li>
</ul><p>It is important for the agency worker to know who is responsible for
ensuring compliance with employment protection legislation - the agency or the
firm for which he or she is working.</p>

<h3>Who is considered the employer of the agency worker?</h3>

<p>This depends on which rights the agency worker is seeking to enforce. Under
the <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfair
dismissals</a> legislation, the employer is the person for whom the employee
actually works rather than the agency. Compliance with <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/health_and_safety/health_safety_work.html">health
and safety</a> requirements is also the responsibility of the person or
organisation for whom the agency worker is actually working.</p>

<p>For the purposes of all other employment legislation, such as the Protection
of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012, the party liable to pay the
wages of the employee (the employment agency or client company) will, normally,
be considered to be the employer of the agency worker.</p>

<p>The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 clarifies the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social
insurance</a> position of agency workers. It provides that agency workers are
insurably employed and the person who pays the wages is the employer for PRSI
purposes.</p>

<h3>Part-time agency workers</h3>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0045/index.html">Protection
of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001</a>, a part-time agency worker can only
compare himself or herself to a comparable full-time employee who is also an
agency worker.</p>

<h3>Legislation that does not apply to agency workers</h3>

<p>The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 applies to most
employees on <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/contracts_of_employment/fixed_term_or_specified_purpose_contracts.html">fixed-term
contracts.</a> It does not apply to agency workers placed by a temporary work
agency to work under the supervision and direction of another organisation.
However, the Act does apply to agency workers employed directly by an
employment agency.</p>

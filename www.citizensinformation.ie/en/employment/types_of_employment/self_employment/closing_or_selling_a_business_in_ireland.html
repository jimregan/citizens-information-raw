<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l8fba1">Sole trader</h2>

<p>If you are a sole trader the process is quite straightforward. You simply
cease trading and inform your clients and suppliers that you are no longer in
business. You need to retain financial and other records for 6 years following
closure.</p>

<p>If you use a business name you must inform the <a href="http://www.cro.ie/">Companies Registration Office</a> that you have
ceased trading within 3 months. You do this using <a href="https://www.cro.ie/Portals/0/Business%20Names%20Forms/RBN3%20v2%20fillable%202016.pdf">Form
RBN3 (pdf).</a> </p>

<p>You can cancel your tax and VAT registration with Revenue by filling out a
<a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/forms/trcn1.pdf">Tax Registration
Cancellation Notification (form TRCN1)(pdf)</a>. </p>

<p>If you owe debts to creditors you are personally responsible for those
debts. You can find out more in our document on <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/dealing_with_debt.html">problem

<h3>Voluntary windup</h3>

<p>If your business is incorporated as a company you may wish to close it due
to retirement or another personal reason. Liquidation is the process of winding
up a company so that it no longer exists by using its assets to pay its debts.
A liquidator is the person appointed to wind up the company and whose principal
function is to dispose of the company’s assets, pay or settle its debts and
distribute any surplus to its members. When a company is in liquidation, the
liquidator usually takes over the powers of the directors. There are 2 types of
voluntary liquidation as follows: </p>
<ul><li>
    <div>
    <strong>Members’ voluntary liquidation:</strong> This is when the members
    of a company that can pay its debts decide to wind it up. Part of this
    process is that a majority of the business directors must make a
    declaration of solvency. This declaration means that they have enquired
    into the affairs of the company and believe that it would be able to pay
    its debts within a certain period. </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <strong>Creditors’ voluntary liquidation:</strong> This is when a company
    is unable to pay its debts when they are due. Sometimes this happens when a
    members’ voluntary liquidation is converted into a creditors’ voluntary
    liquidation. In other cases, it is when the members of a company decide
    that the company’s debts are such that it should be dissolved as a
    creditors’ voluntary liquidation.</div>
  </li>
</ul><h3>Insolvency</h3>

<p>Involuntary liquidation means that a company is wound up by the court. This
happens mainly at the initiation of any member or creditor of the company. In
some circumstances, it can happen by order of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise
and Innovation. The court appoints the liquidator and supervises the
liquidation process.</p>

<p>A receiver may be appointed by the court or when a loan agreement is being
enforced. The receiver is appointed to take control of the assets of the
company which have been used to secure a loan, such as a mortgage. Where a loan
is secured on certain company assets the receiver sells these assets on behalf
of the lender.</p>

<p>If a company goes into examinership, it means that the company's financial
health is ailing, but that the company is still potentially viable. An examiner
is a person appointed to a company by the Court to assess the company’s
position and prepare a rescue plan for the company. </p>

booklet (pdf)</a> published by the Office of the Director of Corporate
Enforcement. There are <a href="http://www.odce.ie/en-gb/publications/publicationsrelatingtoliquidations.aspx">lists

Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l2aab5">Employees and closing a business</h2>

<p>When a business is closed or transferred, the law protects the rights of
employees in these circumstances. </p>

<p>If you no longer require the services of some of your employees (because you
are in financial difficulties or you are reorganising your firm) you may need
to make them <a href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/overview_redundancy.html">redundant</a>.
You must ensure that fair procedures are followed which include fair selection
criteria, giving the employee at least 2 weeks’ notice and paying the
redundancy payment due to the employee on the date of dismissal. Your employees
may be entitled to bring a claim for unfair dismissal if they consider that
they were unfairly selected for redundancy or consider that a genuine
redundancy situation did not exist.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Schemes/RedundancyandInsolvency/insolvency/Pages/Employee_Guide.aspx">Insolvency
Payments Scheme</a> is a scheme set up to pay certain outstanding entitlements
concerning the pay of an employee where employment has been terminated. This is
only in the instance of employer's insolvency.</p>

<h3>Collective redundancies</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1977/en/act/pub/0007/index.html">Protection
of Employment Acts 1977-2007</a> provides that where employers are planning <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/collective_redundancies.html">collective
redundancies</a>, they are obliged to supply the employees' representatives
with information. They must inform the representatives of specific information
regarding the proposed redundancies and to consult with those representatives
at least 30 days before the first dismissal takes place. This is to see if the
redundancies can be avoided or lessened or their effects can be mitigated.</p>

<p>In addition the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0009/index.html">Employees
(Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006</a> requires employers of
50 or more people to consult with employees on substantial changes in the
workplace, including proposals for collective redundancies. </p>

<h3>Redundancy Payments Scheme</h3>

<p>All eligible employees are entitled to a <a href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/redundancy_payments.html">statutory
redundancy payment</a> when they are made redundant. If you pay the statutory
redundancy entitlement and give proper notice of redundancy to your employees
in 2012 you are entitled to a 15% rebate from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).
There will be <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/employerrebate.aspx">no
statutory redundancy employer rebate where the date of dismissal due to
redundancy is on or after 1 January 2013</a>.</p>

<h3>Transfer of business</h3>

<p>The European Union has created some regulations to <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/contracts_of_employment/transfer_of_business.html">safeguard
employees' rights on transfer of undertakings</a>. These safeguards are in
place in Ireland and provide that the rights and obligations of the original
owner arising from an employment contract relationship existing at the date of
transfer shall by reason of such transfer, be transferred to the new owner (the
transferee). </p>

<p>If you are an <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/rights_of_residence_in_ireland/residence_rights_eu_national.html">EEA
or Swiss national</a> you are entitled to come and work in Ireland either as an
employed or a self-employed person. EEA and Swiss nationals do not require a
business permission to establish a business in Ireland and they do not require
a visa to visit, travel to, live or work in Ireland. Non-EEA nationals can
establish a business in Ireland but they require permission to do so. There are
3 ways in which non-EEA nationals can invest or start a business in Ireland –
see ‘Schemes for self-employed non-EEA nationals’ below.</p>

<p>If you are coming from outside Ireland to set up a business you will need
information on a number of topics such as tax and legal requirements – see
‘Information and supports’ below.</p>

<h3>Immigrant Investor Programme</h3>

<p>The Immigrant Investor Programme provides a range of investment options
which allows approved non-EEA investors and their immediate family enter
Ireland on multi-entry visas and remain here for up to 5 years with the
possibility of ongoing renewal. The investment must be good for Ireland, good
for jobs and in the public interest. The funds must be legally acquired and
owned, not borrowed, by the investor.</p>

<p>In order to be considered for the Programme, the proposed investment must be
in one of the following categories. </p>
<ul><li><strong>Endowment:</strong> €500,000 to a public project benefiting the
    arts, sports, health, culture or education. The endowment can be €400,000
    per investor if it is pooled by at least 5 individuals.</li>
  <li><strong>Enterprise Investment:</strong> In 2017 a minimum €1 million
    (was 500,000) aggregate investment into new or existing Irish businesses
    for a minimum of 3 years</li>
  <li><strong>Immigrant Investor Bonds:</strong> A minimum €1,000,000
    investment in a 5-year immigrant investor bond (suspended since 18 July
    2016)</li>
  <li><strong>Mixed Investment:</strong> A minimum €450,000 in property and
    €500,000 in immigrant investor bonds (suspended since 18 July 2016)</li>
  <li><strong>Investment Fund:</strong> A minimum of €1 million (was
    €500,000) in an approved investment fund which would invest in Irish
    businesses and projects</li>
  <li><strong>Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT):</strong> A minimum
    investment of €2 million in any Irish REIT listed on the Irish Stock
    Exchange. The investment may be spread across a number of Irish REITs. </li>
</ul><p>You can read more information in the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/imm-inv-prog-funding-guide-dec2016.pdf/Files/imm-inv-prog-funding-guide-dec2016.pdf">Immigrant
Investor Programme Guidelines (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Start-up Entrepreneur Programme</h3>

<p>The Start-up Entrepreneur Programme (STEP) allows a non-EEA national with an
innovative business idea and minimum funding of €50,000 to come and set up a
business in Ireland. The aim of the Programme is to support High Potential
Start-Ups which are defined as start-up ventures that are:</p>
<ul><li>Introducing a new or innovative product or service to international
    markets</li>
  <li>Capable of creating 10 jobs in Ireland and realising €1 million in
    sales within three to four years of starting up</li>
  <li>Led by an experienced management team</li>
  <li>Headquartered and controlled in Ireland</li>
  <li>Less than 6 years old</li>
</ul><p><strong>New 12-month immigration permission</strong>: From 15 March 2014 <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Minister%20Shatter%20announces%20targeted%20changes%20in%20the%20Start-up%20Entrepreneur%20Programme">a
12-month immigration permission</a> will be available for foreign national
entrepreneurs attending incubators or innovation bootcamps in Ireland to allow
them to prepare a STEP application. This 12-month permission will also be made
available to non-EEA students who graduate with advanced STEM (Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) degrees in Ireland and wish to work
on preparing a STEP application.</p>

<p>The STEP scheme does not apply to retail, catering, personal services or
similar businesses - see 'Business permission' below. No initial job creation
targets will be set as it is recognised that such businesses can take some time
to get off the ground. There is detailed information in the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/step-applic-guide-dec2016.pdf/Files/step-applic-guide-dec2016.pdf">Start-up
Entrepreneur Programme Guidelines (pdf).</a></p>

<h3>Business permission</h3>

<p>If you are not eligible for the Start-up Entrepreneur Programme or if you
wish to start a retail, catering, personal services or similar business you
should apply for a business permission. This is a written permission from the
Minister for Justice and Equality that allows you to establish and engage in a
business in Ireland for a certain period. Since 16 March 2016 the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP09000013">business permission
scheme has been suspended</a> while the business, start-up entrepreneur and
immigrant investor schemes are being reviewed. Applications for the scheme
received before 16 March 2016 are not affected.</p>

<p>If you are applying for a business permission to start a business in
Ireland, you must meet the following strict criteria:</p>
<ul><li>You must have at least €300,000 of your own money to invest in business
    in Ireland. </li>
  <li>Your business must create employment for at least 2 Irish or EEA or Swiss
    nationals or at least maintain employment in an existing business </li>
  <li>Your business must add to the commercial activity and competitiveness of
    the State </li>
  <li>Your business must be a viable trading concern and provide you with
    sufficient income to maintain and accommodate yourself and any dependants
    without resorting to social assistance or paid employment for which a
    General Employment Permit would be required </li>
</ul><p><strong>Artists, writers or crafts people</strong> do not have to meet the
capital and employment requirements. However they must show that they are well
known in their field and that they can support themselves without the need for
other employment or social assistance. In these cases they should contact the
Department of Justice and Equality separately.</p>

<h3>Residency</h3>

<p>Successful applicants for the <strong>Immigrant Investor Programme</strong>
and the <strong>Start-up Entrepreneur Programme</strong> and their immediate
families will be granted residence permission for 2 years initially. Their
immediate family means their spouse, civil partner or partner and dependent
children aged under 18. This permission can be renewed for a further 3 years.
After these first 5 years, the investor or entrepreneur can apply for long-term
residence. If required they will be granted multiple entry visas for the same
duration.</p>

<p>Usually, a <strong>business permission</strong> is granted for 1 year
initially.<a shape="rect" href="../../../../moving_country/moving_to_ireland/rights_of_residence_in_ireland/residence_rights_of_non_eea_nationals_in_ireland.html">Non-EEA
nationals who are granted a business permission are entitled to live in
Ireland</a> for the duration of the business permission. They should check if
they require a <a href="../../../moving_country/moving_to_ireland/coming_to_live_in_ireland/visa_requirements_for_entering_ireland.html">visa
to enter Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0045/index.html">Protection
of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001</a> aims to:</p>
<ul><li>Ensure that a <a shape="rect" href="part_time_workers.html">part-time
    employee</a> cannot be treated less favourably than a comparable full-time
    employee regarding <a href="../../employment_rights_and_conditions/">conditions of employment</a>
  </li>
  <li>Ensure that all employee protection legislation applies to a part-time
    employee in the same manner as it already applies to a full-time employee.
    Any qualifying conditions (with the exception of any hours thresholds) that
    apply to a full-time employee in any of that legislation also apply to a
    part-time employee </li>
  <li>Enhance the quality of part-time work </li>
  <li>Facilitate the development of part-time work on a voluntary basis and to
    contribute to the flexible organisation of working time in a way that takes
    account of the needs of employers and workers. </li>
</ul><p>The Act abolishes the requirement that a part-time worker should be in the
continuous hourly employment of the employer for not less than 13 weeks and
should normally be expected to work not less than 8 hours per week. However,
the calculation of continuous service for the purposes of entitlement under,
for example, the <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfair
dismissals</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/redundancy.html">redundancy</a>
legislation still applies. In effect, a part-time employee will still be
required to have 12 months continuous service with his/her employer from the
start of the employee's employment. </p>

<p>The entitlement of the part-time employee is in proportion to the
entitlement of the full-time employee.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>When can a part-time worker can be compared to a full-time worker?</h3>

<p>A part-time worker can be compared to a full-time worker when:</p>
<ul><li>The part-time worker performs the same work as the full-time worker under
    the same or similar conditions (or both workers are interchangeable with
    the other in relation to the work). </li>
  <li>The work performed by one of the employees is of the same or a similar
    nature to that performed by the other worker. In addition, any differences
    between the work performed or the conditions under which it is performed by
    each worker are either of little importance in relation to the work as a
    whole, or occur so irregularly as not to be insignificant </li>
</ul><p><strong>and </strong></p>
<ul><li>The work performed by the part-time employee is equal or greater in value
    to the work performed by the other employee concerned. </li>
</ul><p>A part-time agency worker can only compare himself or herself to a
comparable full-time employee who is also an agency worker. Likewise, a
part-time employee, who is not an agency worker, cannot compare themselves to a
full-time agency worker. </p>

<h3>When can a part-time worker can be treated less favourably than a full-time
worker?</h3>

<p>A part-time employee can be treated less favourably than a comparable
full-time employee where such treatment can be justified in two
circumstances:</p>
<ul><li>Where the part-time worker's less favourable treatment can be justified
    on "objective grounds" </li>
  <li>Pensions </li>
</ul><h3>"Objective grounds" for less favourable treatment</h3>

<p>"Objective grounds" for treating a part-time worker less favourably than a
comparable full-time employee are based on considerations <span>other
than</span> the status of the employee as a part-time worker. These grounds
occur where the less favourable treatment is necessary for the purpose of
achieving a legitimate objective of the employer. </p>

<p>However, what may be not considered as objective grounds in relation to less
favourable treatment of a part-time employee may be considered objective
grounds in relation to a casual part-time employee. (Casual employees are those
with fewer than 13 weeks' service who are not in regular or seasonal employment
or are casual based on a collective agreement to that effect.)</p>

<h3>Pensions</h3>

<p>A part-time employee who normally works less than 20% of the normal hours of
the comparable full-time employee can be treated in a less favourable manner
with regard to a pension scheme or arrangement. However, this provision does
not prevent an employer and a part-time employee from entering into an
agreement whereby the part-time employee receives the same pension benefits as
a comparable full-time employee. </p>

<h3>Part-time workers and overtime</h3>

<p>Part-time workers are entitled to overtime if the full-time employee to
which they compare themselves is paid overtime after working his/her maximum
hours per week. </p>

<p>In order to claim overtime however, your employer can determine that
part-time employees must work the same number of hours as a full-time employee
before you can claim overtime. (In other words, if full time employees must
work a 39 hour week before overtime rate of pay is paid, then your employer can
state that part-time employees must work the same number of hours). In this
case, if you work 20 hours per week, any hours worked between 20 and 39 hours
must be paid at the normal rate. </p>

<p>Note that employers are not required by law to pay employees higher rates
(that is, "double time") for work completed in overtime. You must however,
receive <span>at the very least</span>, your normal hourly rate of pay for
overtime. </p>

<h3>Access to part-time work</h3>

<p>An employer is <span>not</span> obliged to provide access to part-time work
to his or her employees. The <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Good_Workplace_Relations/codes_practice/COP7/">Code
of Practice on Access to Part-Time Work</a> aims to encourage employers and
employees to consider part-time work and to provide guidance on procedures to
improve access to part-time work for those employees who wish to work on a
part-time basis.</p>

<h3>Penalisation of part-time employees </h3>

<p>An employer is prohibited from penalising a part-time employee on the
grounds that: </p>
<ul><li>The employee exercised or proposes to exercise his/her right not to be
    treated in a less favourable manner than a comparable full-time employee in
    relation to conditions of employment </li>
  <li>The employee,in good faith, opposed by lawful means an act that is
    unlawful under the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act </li>
  <li>The employee refused to accede to a request by the employer to transfer
    from performing full-time work to performing part-time work or vice versa
  </li>
</ul><p><strong>or</strong></p>
<ul><li>The employee gave evidence in any proceedings under the Protection of
    Employees (Part-Time Work) Act or gave notice of his or her intention to do
    so or to do any other thing referred to in the bulleted points mentioned
    above. </li>
</ul><p><strong>Penalisation:</strong> The following actions are considered to be
penalisations of the employee:</p>
<ul><li>The dismissal of the employee </li>
  <li>An unfavourable change in the conditions of employment of the employee
  </li>
  <li>Unfair treatment of the employee, including selection for redundancy </li>
  <li>Any other action that is prejudicial to the part-time worker's
    employment. </li>
</ul><p>Employers will not be considered to have penalised a part-time employee in
certain circumstances. For example, in relation to a request by the employer
that the employee transfers from full-time work to part-time work (or vice
versa) when the following conditions are met: </p>
<ul><li>The employer <span>must</span> have substantial grounds <span>both</span>
    to justify the making of the request <span>and</span> for taking any action
    after the employee's refusal to transfer from full-time work to part-time
    work or the other way round</li>
  <li>The taking of the action is in accordance with the employee's <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/contracts_of_employment/contract_of_employment.html">contract
    of employment</a> and the provisions of employment rights legislation </li>
</ul><p><strong>Protection against penalisation:</strong> if an employee has less
than one year's service and is dismissed within the meaning of the <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">Unfair
Dismissals Acts 1973 to 2007</a>, they may refer a case to the <a href="../enforcement_and_redress/labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace
Relations Commission</a> under this Act.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>Complaints, disputes or grievances regarding breaches of employment rights
under certain legislation can be referred to the Workplace Relations Commission
(WRC). You must notify your employer of your intention to contact the Workplace
Relations Commission. Where legal entitlements are involved, you should try and
resolve the matter locally before referring to the Workplace Relations
Commission.</p>

<p>You apply regarding breaches of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work)
Act 2001 within 6 months of the breach occurring. You must use the online
complaint form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.
The time limit may be extended for up to a further 6 months, but only where
there is a reasonable cause which prevented the complaint being brought within
the normal time limit.</p>

<p>The number of people working in part-time employment has greatly increased
in the past few years. One of the reasons for this is the large number of
people returning to the workplace (perhaps having brought up a family). Another
reason is a more flexible, family-friendly attitude by employers to employees
working in this way. </p>

<h3>Access to part-time working</h3>

<p>Following the introduction of the <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Good_Workplace_Relations/codes_practice/COP7/">Code
of Practice on Access to Part-Time Work</a> in 2006 best practice for employers
is to have policies on improving access to part-time work. The Code of Practice
aims to encourage employers and employees to consider part-time work and
provides guidance on procedures to improve access to part-time work for those
employees who wish to work on a part-time basis. In general employers should
consider how to introduce opportunities for part-time work and should maximise
the range of posts available for part-time work.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that if you are in full-time employment, you do
not have a statutory right to change to part-time employment or to other
flexible working arrangements such as job sharing or unpaid time off work. If
you wish to change from full-time to part-time work or from part-time to
full-time work it is a matter to be agreed between you and your employer. </p>

<p><strong>Requests for part-time work</strong><br>
If you make a request for part-time work, your employer should have a procedure
for dealing with your application which allows for consultation and discussion
before a decision is made. Your employer should consider your request seriously
and take factors into account such as your personal family needs, the
implications for the organisation, the number of part-time employees, the equal
opportunities policy and the staffing needs of the organisation. Your request
should be considered on non-discriminatory grounds in accordance with <a href="http://www.ihrec.ie/publications/list/ihrec-employment-equality-rights-explained/">employment
equality legislation</a>.</p>

<p>Your employer may refuse your request but should have good reasons for
refusing it, for example, that it would lead to staffing difficulties in the
organisation. You should be given the reasons for the refusal. </p>

<p><strong></strong>Since 8 March 2013, under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/si/0081.html">European Union
(Parental Leave) Regulations 2013</a>, when you return to work after taking <a href="../../employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/parental_leave.html">parental
leave</a>, you are entitled to ask for a change in your work pattern or working
hours for a set period. Your employer must consider your request but is not
obliged to grant it.</p>

<h3>Who is a part-time employee? </h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="employment_rights_of_part_time_workers.html">rights of part-time
employees</a> are protected in law through the Protection of Employees (Part
Time Work) Act 2001. A part-time employee in Ireland is defined in the Act as
"an employee whose normal hours of work are less than the normal hours of work
of an employee who is a comparable employee in relation to him or her". A
comparable employee means a full-time employee (of the same or opposite sex) to
whom a part-time employee compares himself/herself. A part-time worker no
longer has to have 13 continuous weeks' service and no longer has to work a
minimum of 8 hours per week in order to qualify for protection under the
Act.</p>

<p>The Act applies to any part-time worker in Ireland and generally includes
the following: </p>
<ul><li>Someone working under a contract of employment or apprenticeship </li>
  <li>Someone employed through an employment agency or </li>
  <li>Someone holding office under or in the service of the State. (For
    example, An Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces, <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/government_departments/the_civil_service.html">civil
    servants</a> and employees of the <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/how_health_is_organised/health_boards.html">Health Service
    Executive</a>, harbour authority or education and training board (ETB).
  </li>
  <li>Someone sharing a job with another person. </li>
</ul><p>In the case of <a shape="rect" href="../full_time_employment/agency_workers.html">agency workers</a>, the
party liable to pay the wages of the employee (the employment agency or client
company) will, normally, be considered to be the employer for the purposes of
the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act. The agency or client company
are also responsible for ensuring that the part-time employee is not treated in
a less favourable manner than a comparable full-time employee. </p>

<h3>What is the purpose of the Act?</h3>

<p>The purpose of the Act is to provide that part-time employees are not
treated in a less favourable manner than a comparable full-time employee unless
there are objective reasons for such treatment. Where an employer tries to
justify less favourable treatment on objective grounds he/she has to show that
the difference in treatment is based on grounds other than the part-time status
of the employee, is a legitimate purpose of the employer, and is appropriate
and necessary for that purpose. What may be considered as not being objective
grounds in relation to regular part-time workers, however, may be considered
objective grounds in relation to casual part-time workers. </p>

<h3>Casual workers</h3>

<p>A casual worker is a part-time worker who works on a casual basis. Casual
part-time workers are those with fewer than 13 continous weeks' service who are
not in regular or seasonal employment, or are casual, based on a collective
agreement to that effect.</p>

<p>An employee's service in an employment is continuous unless that service is
terminated by the employee's dismissal or the employee's voluntary departure
from his or her employment.</p>

<h3>Flexible working</h3>

<p>Flexible hours and flexible working arrangements are generally at the
discretion of individual employers and are not governed by specific
legislation. People who share a job are viewed as part-time workers and have
all the statutory entitlements of part-time workers. </p>

<p>The Workplace Relations Commission has a <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Guide_to_Protection_of_Employees_Part-time_Work_Act.pdf">guide

<h3>Who is an employee?</h3>

<p>While in most cases it will be perfectly clear who is an employee, sometimes
it is not quite so clear. For example, a business anxious to avoid employment
legislation, tax and social insurance may insist that all people working for
the firm are self-employed rather than employees. In other words, the person
you are doing work for insists that you are not his/her employee but instead
you are a self-employed person asked to do a particular piece of work. You
however, consider yourself to be an employee. In this case - who is right? </p>

<h3>Employed or self-employed?</h3>

<p>Deciding whether you are employed or self-employed has a number of
implications for you. The majority of employment protection legislation applies
to employees only and the tax and social insurance system will treat you very
differently depending on whether you are employed or self-employed. </p>

<p>There is no definition of <em>employed</em> or <em>self-employed</em> in
employment law. The decision on your employment status is reached by looking at
what you do, how you do it and the terms and conditions under you were engaged.
The important point is that you (or the person you do work for) don't make the
final decision. Instead, Revenue or the Department of Social Protection or
perhaps a court or tribunal will make that decision applying standard tests and
based on the real nature of your working relationship. Examples of such tests
are: whether you control the work, who supplies the materials and whether you
get holiday pay. </p>

<p>So it could be that in law you are considered an employee, even though you
have agreed with another person that you will work for him or her as a
self-employed person. The <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/code-of-practice-on-employment-status.pdf">Code
of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-employment Status of Individuals
(pdf)</a> contains criteria which can be used to clarify whether a person is
employed or self-employed. </p>

<p>In most cases, it is clear whether a person is an employee or not. However
if this is a problem for you, then it is best to get more detailed legal advice
or guidance from your local tax office or the Scope Section of the Department
of Social Protection - see 'Where to apply' below.</p>

<h3>Part-time employees</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../part_time_employment/part_time_workers.html">Part-time employees</a>
are in a similar position to full-time employees when it comes to employment
protection legislation, although in some instances a part-time employee will
need to work a set minimum number of hours for a set period of time before
acquiring rights. You can read more about the <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Guide_to_Protection_of_Employees_Part-time_Work_Act.pdf">protection
of part-time employees in this explanatory booklet (pdf)</a> from Workplace
Relations Commmission. </p>

<h3>Fixed-term employees</h3>

<p>Many more people are now employed on a fixed-term basis (or on specific
purpose contracts). Employees working on repeated fixed-term contracts are
covered under the unfair dismissals legislation, through they need to have at
least one year's continuous service before they can bring a claim under the
Unfair Dismissals Acts. Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0029/index.html">Protection
of Employees (Fixed Term Work) Act 2003</a>, employers cannot continually renew
fixed term contracts. Employees can only work on one or more fixed term
contracts for a continuous period of four years. After this the employee is
considered to have a contract of indefinite duration (for example, a permanent
contract). Under the Act fixed-term workers cannot be treated less favourably
than comparable permanent workers. You can read more about the Protection of
Employees (Fixed Term Work) 2003 Act in <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Guide_-_Protection_of_Employees_Fixed-term_Work_Act.pdf">this
explanatory booklet (pdf)</a> from the Workplace Relations Commission.</p>

<p>Specified purpose contracts are contracts that are entered into in order to
complete a special project or for a special purpose. The provisons under the
unfair dismissals and protection of workers legislation apply equally to
specified purpose contracts. </p>

<h3>Casual employees</h3>

<p>There is no definition of <em>casual employees</em> in employment law. In
reality, casual workers are on standby to do work as required without fixed
hours or attendance arrangements. However, these workers are employees, for
employment rights purposes. </p>

<p>Some legislation will apply, for example, the right to receive a pay slip.
In other instances where a set period of employment is required it will be
unlikely that a casual employee will have sufficient service to qualify, for
example, 2 years' service is required in order to be entitled to statutory
redundancy. </p>

<h3>Children and young people</h3>

<p>The law does not allow children (that is, those aged under 16) to be
employees apart from in very restricted circumstances, for example, to take
part in a film.</p>
<ul><li>Children aged over 14 may do light work outside school term. </li>
  <li>Children aged over 15, but under 16, may also do light work and this may
    be during school term. </li>
</ul><p>In any of the above circumstances there are restrictions on the number of
hours that may be worked and when the work may be done, with a complete
prohibition on work between 8pm and 8am.</p>

<p>Young people (those between 16-18 years of age) may become employees but
there are restrictions on the maximum hours that can be worked and generally
the work cannot be between 10pm and 6am.</p>

<p>An employer of a child or young person must:</p>
<ul><li>Obtain a copy of the person's birth certificate </li>
  <li>If a child is being employed, obtain a letter of consent from the child's
    parent / guardian </li>
  <li>Keep records of the employee's details such as date of birth, and of the
    hours worked. You can read more <a shape="rect" href="../../starting_work_and_changing_job/young_people_at_work/rights_of_young_workers.html">detailed
    information about the protection of young people in employment</a>. </li>

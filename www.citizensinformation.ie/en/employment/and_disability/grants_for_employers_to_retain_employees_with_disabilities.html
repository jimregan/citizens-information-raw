<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>The Employee Retention Grant Scheme is a scheme that aims to assist
employers to retain employees who acquire an illness, condition or impairment
that affects their ability to carry out their job. The scheme is part of the
Department of Social Protection’s Reasonable Accommodation Fund and it aims
to maintain your employability by providing funding to: </p>
<ul><li>Retrain you so that you can take up another position within the
  company</li>
  <li>Identify accommodation such as work equipment adaptation and/or training
    to enable you to remain in your current position. </li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The scheme is open to every company in the private sector. Any existing
employee (working at any level in the organisation) who acquires an illness,
condition or disability that affects his or her job is covered under this
scheme. </p>

<p>Public sector employers <span>are not eligible</span> to apply for these
grants. Public sector employers are obliged to promote positive attitudes
toward disability and ensure they put in place all arrangements to ensure the
full integration of staff with disabilities into employment. </p>

<p>Funding under this scheme is made available in 2 stages: </p>

<p><span><strong>Stage 1:</strong></span> Assists employers by allowing them to
hire expert skills from outside the company to develop a written individual
<em>retention strategy</em> for any employee who acquires a disability. The
retention strategy could set out steps needed to accommodate and, if necessary
train the employee to remain in his or her role. Alternatively, the retention
strategy could outline where the employee could be re-deployed in the company
and the accommodation/re-training needed to do this. </p>

<p><span><strong>Stage 2:</strong></span> Provides funding to the employer
towards the implementation of the written retention strategy. This will include
grant aid towards re-training, job coaching and/or hiring an external
co-ordinator to oversee the way the individual retention strategy is
implemented. </p>

<p>The following activities are <span>not eligible</span> for funding under the
Employee Retention Grant Scheme:</p>
<ul><li>Attendance at workshops and seminars</li>
  <li>Capital expenditure associated with training</li>
  <li>Company-wide disability management assessments or the development of
    disability/absent management policies. </li>
</ul><h3>Developing the Retention Strategy</h3>

<p>The employer contacts a specialist (for example, an occupational therapist)
who evaluates the employee's occupational capacity and carries out a
job/workplace assessment. The specialist then develops the retention strategy
in collaboration with the employer, the employee and if it is appropriate, the
employee's advocate/representative (for example, a <a shape="rect" href="../rights_and_conditions/industrial_relations_and_trade_unions/trade_unions.html">trade
union</a> representative) and line-manager. The retention strategy must
accompany an application for Stage 1 funding and must have been received before
an application is made for Stage 2 funding. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p><span>Stage 1: </span>Under the scheme 90% of the programme costs are paid
(up to a maximum amount of €2,500 for each employee) in order to enable the
employer to hire a specialist(s) to evaluate the employee's occupational
capacity, to carry out the workplace/job assessment and to develop a retention
strategy.</p>

<p><span>Stage 2:</span> Funding of 90% of eligible costs to a maximum of
€12,500 is paid to help with:</p>
<ul><li>Training the employee for his or her current post or retraining him or
    her for another post within the company</li>
  <li>Hiring a Job Coach to provide support to the employee and liaise with his
    or her line manager for a maximum of 300 hours and/or</li>
  <li>Hiring a specialist to manage the retention strategy on an ongoing basis
    until the employee's reintegration is complete for a maximum period of 60
    hours. </li>
</ul><p>An employer cannot make an application for funding under Stage 2 without
having the assistance of an individualised written retention strategy. There is
a maximum limit of €15,000 payable to an employer for the purposes of
retaining any one employee i.e. the total funding available for both Stage 1
and Stage 2. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<h3>Applying for Stage 1 funding</h3>

    professional memberships</li>

<ul><li>The written retention strategy if it has not been previously submitted

</ul><p>The application form must be signed by the employee, the employer (or
nominee), the employee's line-manager (where appropriate), the employee's
representative and the specialist. </p>

<p>Where the value of an application is greater than €7,600 and a single
provider provides services, the employer must obtain 3 independent quotations
and present them to DSP. If the lowest quote is not accepted, the employer must
state the reason for the selection. </p>

    his or her employer if it has not previously been admitted.</li>
</ul><p>The application form must be signed by the employee, the employer (or
nominee), the employee's line-manager (where appropriate), the employee's
representative (where appropriate) and the specialist. </p>

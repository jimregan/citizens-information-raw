<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Employers that provide disability awareness training for their staff may be
able to apply for grant aid towards the cost of this training. Disability
awareness aims to provide the best possible customer service to clients and
customers and promotes the employability of disabled people by creating work
environments that are open and welcoming to all staff. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Disability-Awareness-Training_holder.aspx">Disability
Awareness Training Support Scheme</a> is aimed at employers that provide this
training and helps raise awareness of disability issues in the workplace.
Disability awareness also addresses the concerns and misconceptions that
employers and employees may have about working with disabled people. The scheme
is funded under the Department of Social Protection’s Reasonable
Accommodation Fund. </p>

<p>Under the terms of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0021/index.html">Employment
Equality Acts 1998-2015</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0008/index.html">Equal
Status Acts 2000-2015</a> employers are encouraged to initiate "positive
action" training that focuses on achieving equality and eliminating
discrimination. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/en/act/pub/0016/index.html">Workplace
Relations Act 2015</a>, the adjudication service (formerly the Rights
Commissioner Service) now operates as part of the Workplace Relations
Commission. Adjudication officers are independent in the performance of their
duties. They investigate disputes, grievances and claims that individuals or
small groups of workers make under employment legislation including <a href="../unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/overview_redundancy.html">redundancy</a>,
<a href="../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfair

<p>The list of legislation under which complaints may be referred for
adjudication is in <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/16/schedule/5/enacted/en/html#sched5">Schedule
5</a> of the Workplace Relations Act 2015.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>A complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (see 'How to apply' below)
may be made by the person directly affected, that is, the direct complainant
or, in some cases, by a specified person acting on behalf of the direct
complainant. A specified person is a person who is named in the relevant
employment law as being entitled to present a complaint or refer a dispute</p>

<p>Before an employee makes a complaint they should inform their employer that
they intend to contact the <a href="labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace Relations Commission
(WRC)</a>. Where the complaint is about a statutory entitlement they should try
and resolve the matter locally before applying to the WRC.</p>

<p>A complaint is made to the Director General of the WRC initially. The
Director General may refer it to a mediation officer if it is considered that
the complaint can be resolved without being referred to an adjudicator and if
neither party objects to it being dealt with through <a href="workplace_mediation_service.html">mediation</a>. </p>

<h3>Adjudication</h3>

<p>If the complaint is not dealt with through mediation or if the mediation is
not successful, it is referred to an adjudication officer. The adjudication
officer generally conducts an inquiry. The Director General may decide to deal
with the complaint by written submissions only, unless either party objects
within 42 days of being informed. More information about the <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Procedures_Employment_and_Equality_Complaints.pdf">procedures
in the investigation of employment and equality complaints (pdf)</a> is
available on workplacerelations.ie.</p>

<p>At the inquiry both parties have an opportunity to be heard and present any
relevant evidence. The hearings are held in private. The person who is making
the complaint may be accompanied and represented at the hearing by:</p>
<ul><li>A trade union official or an official of a body which represents the
    interests of employers</li>
  <li>A practising barrister or practising solicitor</li>
  <li>In the case of a complainant who is aged under 18 a parent or guardian
    (as well as one of the people already listed)</li>
  <li>Any other person with the permission of the adjudication officer</li>
</ul><p>The adjudication officer makes a decision in accordance with the relevant
law and the decision is given to the parties in writing. At this stage, either
party may appeal this decision – see below.</p>

<p>Decisions by adjudication officers will be published on the internet without
identifying the parties.</p>

<h3>Enforcement of the adjudication officer’s decision</h3>

<p>The employer has 56 days in which to carry out the decision of the
adjudication officer. If the employer fails to do so, the employee, the WRC,
the employee’s trade union or excepted body (an excepted body is a body that
represents the interests of a particular group of workers) may apply to the
District Court for an order directing the employer to do so. In general, the
District Court must make the order. If the decision was to reinstate or
re-engage the employee, the District Court may substitute an order to pay
compensation of up to 104 weeks’ pay calculated in accordance with the rules
under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977–2007.</p>

<p>In all cases involving compensation, the District Court may also order
interest to be paid. It is an offence to fail to comply with an order directing
an employer to pay such compensation to an employee unless the employer can
show, on the balance of probabilities that they were unable to comply with the
order due to financial circumstances.</p>

<h3>Appealing an adjudicator’s decision to the Labour Court</h3>

<p>A decision of an adjudicator may be <a href="employment_appeals.html">appealed to the Labour Court</a> within 42
days. This time limit can be extended if the Labour Court is satisfied that
there were exceptional circumstances causing the delay.</p>

months of the date of the alleged breach of the Act. The time limit for

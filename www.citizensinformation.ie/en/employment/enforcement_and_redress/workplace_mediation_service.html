<p>The <a href="labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace Relations
Commission</a> provides a <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Workplace_Relations_Services/Mediation_Services/">Mediation
Service</a>, which aims to resolve workplace disputes and disagreements,
particularly between individuals or small groups. </p>

<p>This confidential service gives employees and employers in dispute with each
other an opportunity to work with a mediator to find a mutually agreed solution
to the problem. Workplace mediation is a voluntary process which needs to have
both sides agreeing to participate and to work towards a solution to the
problem. </p>

<p>If no agreed solution is reached, other ways of resolving the issues will
have to be used. In that situation the mediator will assist the participants to
decide how best to proceed. You can read more in our document on <a shape="rect" href="enforcing_your_employment_rights.html">employment rights
enforcement</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Early Resolution Service:</strong> If you have made a complaint
about your employment rights, and you are willing to engage in mediation, in
certain cases you may be offered the Early Resolution Service (ERS) which is
part of the Mediation Service. If both parties are agreeable, the ERS contacts
them by phone in order to resolve the dispute through mediation.</p>

<h3>Why use workplace mediation? </h3>

<p>The advantage of using workplace mediation is that it allows a problem to be
resolved informally, by ensuring that all the sides are heard. As they work
together to solve the problem, the resolution of it is in the control of the
participants. Where they are committed to a mutually agreed solution it is
likely to be more effective and last longer. Also, as workplace mediation is
used before the issue is referred for adjudication.</p>

<p>The type of situations that are dealt with by the Mediation Service include:
</p>
<ul><li>Where there are personal differences or people have problems working
    together </li>
  <li>Where a working relationship has broken down </li>
  <li>Where issues have arisen from a grievance and disciplinary procedure </li>
  <li>Where there are industrial relations issues that have not been referred
    through statutory dispute resolution processes.</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The Mediation Service operates according to the following principles: </p>
<ul><li>It is a voluntary process, all parties must agree to participate. </li>
  <li>Anyone who wishes to withdraw from it may do so at any stage. </li>
  <li>The whole process is confidential unless the parties agree otherwise </li>
  <li>It is fast and starts as soon as everyone is available </li>
  <li>The mediator is impartial </li>
  <li>Its focus is to find a solution to the dispute which is agreeable to all
    parties and which will work. </li>
</ul><p>The aim of the process is to allow each person involved in the dispute the
opportunity to be heard and to work with the other party to reach a solution.
It is a flexible process which may involve joint meetings or meetings with the
mediator alone, depending on the particular situation. </p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>It is best if both parties apply jointly for workplace mediation. Mediation
is most effective where both parties agree to participate. If one party does
not agree the Mediation Service will work to get both parties to attend but as
it is a voluntary process, participation can not be enforced. </p>

<p>Applications should be made in writing to the Mediation Service of the
Workplace Relations Commission using the <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Contact_Us/Mediation_Referral_Form/">online
mediation referral form</a> or by post using the address below. The application
should include the name and contact details of both parties, the number of
people involved and a brief description of the problem. </p>

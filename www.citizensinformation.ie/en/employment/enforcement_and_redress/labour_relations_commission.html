<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) was established on 1 October 2015
under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/en/act/pub/0016/index.html">Workplace
Relations Act 2015</a>. It has taken over the functions of the National
Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission and the Director
of the Equality Tribunal. It has also taken over some of the functions of the
Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT). However, the appeal functions of the EAT
have been transferred to the <a href="employment_appeals.html">Labour
Court</a>, which is now the single appeal body for all workplace relations
appeals.</p>

<p>The main functions of the WRC are to:</p>
<ul><li>Promote the improvement of workplace relations, and maintenance of good
    workplace relations</li>
  <li>Promote and encourage compliance with the relevant laws</li>
  <li>Provide guidance in relation to compliance with codes of practice</li>
  <li>Conduct reviews of, and monitor developments as respects, workplace
    relations</li>
  <li>Conduct or commission relevant research and provide advice, information
    and the findings of research to Joint Labour Committees and Joint
    Industrial Councils</li>
  <li>Advise the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in relation to
    the application of, and compliance with, relevant laws</li>
  <li>Provide information to the public in relation to employment laws other
    than the Employment Equality Act (information about this Act is provided by
    the <a href="../../justice/law_and_rights/irish_human_rights_commission.html">Irish
    Human Rights and Equality Commission</a>)</li>
</ul><p>The WRC may also provide advice on any matter relating to workplace
relations to employers, their representative bodies and to employees, trade
unions or other representative bodies of employees. It has specific functions
in relation to the resolution of industrial disputes and the implementation of
employment laws. It is the body to which all industrial relations disputes and
all disputes and complaints about employment laws will be presented. More
information is available in this <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/WRC-Quick-Guide-Booklet-Eng-.pdf">guide
to the Workplace Relations Commission (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>The WRC operates the following services:</p>

<h3>Advisory Service <br></h3>

<p>The Advisory Service provides advice and assistance on industrial relations
in the workplace to employers, employees and their representatives. It helps
employers and employees to develop positive working relationships and
mechanisms to solve problems. One of its services is preventative mediation,
advising on grievance procedures and structural change. The WRC has also
published codes of practice including <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Good_Workplace_Relations/codes_practice/COP3/">Grievance
and Disciplinary Procedures</a> and <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Good_Workplace_Relations/codes_practice/COP6/">Procedures
for addressing Bullying in the Workplace</a>. You can read more in this list of
<a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Frequently_Asked_Questions/Advisory_Service/Advisory_Service.html">frequently
asked questions about the Advisory Service</a>.</p>

<h3>Conciliation Service </h3>

<p>The Conciliation Service helps employers and their employees to resolve
disputes when they have failed to reach agreement during their own previous
negotiations. An Industrial Relations Officer of the Commission acts as
chairperson during meetings to negotiate an agreement. The majority of the
cases referred to conciliation are settled. If no agreement is reached then, if
the parties wish, the dispute may be referred to the <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/WR_Bodies/Labour_Court/Labour_Court.html">Labour
Court</a>.</p>

<h3>Mediation Service</h3>

<p>Mediation is a voluntary process which needs to have both sides agreeing to
participate and to work towards resolving the problem. It ensures that all the
sides are heard and the participants are involved in finding an agreed
solution.</p>

<p><strong>Employment rights issues:</strong> The WRC may offer a mediation
service to facilitate the resolution of employment rights complaints or
disputes without the use of adjudication. They may only be referred for
mediation with the agreement of both parties to the complaint or dispute. Where
a complaint/dispute is not resolved, it will be referred for adjudication. Find
out more in our document about <a shape="rect" href="workplace_mediation_service.html">workplace mediation</a>. </p>

<p>If you have made a complaint about your employment rights and you have
agreed to participate in mediation you may be offered the Early Resolution
Service (ERS) which is part of the Mediation Service. The ERS contacts the
parties to the dispute by phone with the aim of mediating a resolution. If the
dispute is not resolved by the service, your complaint will be sent without any
delay to the adjudication service.</p>

<p><strong>Internal workplace issues:</strong> The Workplace Mediation Service
aims to resolve workplace disputes and disagreements, particularly between
individuals or small groups. This confidential service, which is provided by
officers of the WRC Conciliation and Advisory Services, gives employees and
employers who are in dispute with each other an opportunity to work with a
mediator to find a mutually agreed solution to problems, such as breakdown in a
working relationship or issues arising from a grievance and disciplinary
procedure.</p>

<h3>Adjudication Service</h3>

<p>The Adjudication Service (formerly the Rights Commissioner Service)
investigates disputes, grievances and claims that individuals or small groups
of workers make under the employment legislation listed in <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/16/schedule/5/enacted/en/html">Schedule
5 of the Workplace Relations Act</a>. Adjudicators are independent in the
performance of their duties and have a wide range of functions under this
employment legislation . You can find more information in our document on <a href="rights_commissioner.html">adjudication of employment rights and
disputes</a>.</p>

<h3>Inspection Service</h3>

<p>The Inspection Services (formerly operated by NERA) monitor employment
conditions to ensure the compliance and enforcement of employment rights
legislation. They also carry out inspections and gather information in relation
to other employment laws. For example, employees or interested parties may ask
for an inspection in relation to the protection of young people in employment.
You can read more in our document on <a href="national_employment_rights_authority.html">employment rights
legislation inspection and compliance</a>.</p>

<h3>Employment rights information</h3>

<p>Information on rights and entitlements under employment legislation is
provided by <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Workplace_Relations_Services/Info_Cust_Serv/">WRC
Information and Customer Service</a>. </p>

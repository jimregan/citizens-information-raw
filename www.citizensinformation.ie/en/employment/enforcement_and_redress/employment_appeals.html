<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/16/enacted/en/html">Workplace
Relations Act 2015</a> the <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/WR_Bodies/Labour_Court/Labour_Court.html">Labour
Court</a> is the single appeal body for all workplace relations appeals,
including those previously heard by the Employment Appeals Tribunal. You may
appeal to it against decisions of a Workplace Relations Commission adjudicator.
The Employment Appeals Tribunal continues to hear appeals submitted before the
commencement of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 on 1 October 2015.</p>

<h3>Making an appeal</h3>

<p>Under the Workplace Relations Act 2015 cases are first heard by an
adjudicator. You may appeal the decision of the adjudicator to the Labour
Court.</p>

<p>The time limit for making an appeal is 42 days after the date of the
decision of the adjudicator. This time limit can be extended if the Labour
Court is satisfied that there were exceptional circumstances causing the
delay.</p>

<p>The Labour Court may decide to deal with the complaint or dispute by written
submissions only, unless either party objects to this within 42 days of being
informed.</p>

<p>You do not have to be represented at the Labour Court, but if you wish you
may you may be accompanied and represented at the hearing by:</p>
<ul><li>A trade union official or an official of a body which represents the
    interests of employers</li>
  <li>A practising barrister or practising solicitor</li>
  <li>In the case of a complainant who is aged under 18 a parent or guardian
    (as well as one of the people already listed)</li>
  <li>Any other person with the permission of the Labour Court</li>
</ul><p>If you do not have a representative to present your case, the Labour Court
will ensure that you are not at a disadvantage as a result of this. You should
make sure you have all the relevant documents, such as a <a href="../employment_rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/no_p45_no_p60.html">P45
or a P60</a>.</p>

<p>Labour Court hearings on appeals are in public unless the Labour Court
decides that they should be in private (or partly in private) because of
special circumstances. The Labour Court has wide powers to require witnesses to
attend and to take evidence on oath.</p>

<p>The Labour Court may refer a question of law arising in the appeal to the <a href="../../justice/courts_system/high_court.html">High Court</a>. The High
Court’s determination is final and conclusive.</p>

<h3>Appealing a Labour Court decision</h3>

<p>In most cases, the decision may be appealed to the High Court by either
party but only on a point of law. Again, the High Court’s determination is
final and conclusive.</p>

<h3>Enforcement of a Labour Court decision</h3>

<p>An employer has 42 days to implement the Labour Court’s decision. If the
employer fails to do so, the employee, the Workplace Relations Commission, the
employee’s trade union or <em>excepted body</em> may apply to the District
Court for an order directing the employer to do so.(An excepted body is a body
that represents the interests of a particular group of workers.) The District
Court must grant the order.</p>

<p>In cases where compensation is to be paid, the District Court may also order
the payment of interest. It is an offence to fail to comply with an order
directing an employer to pay such compensation to an employee unless the
employer can show, on the balance of probabilities, that they were unable to
comply with the order due to financial circumstances.</p>

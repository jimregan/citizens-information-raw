<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The term <em>victimisation</em> is used to describe unfair treatment of a
worker by an employer because of some action the worker has taken. Some
employment legislation protects you from victimisation if you are seeking to
avail of or availing of your rights under the legislation. This means that your
employer may not penalise you by dismissal, unfair treatment or an unfavourable
change in your conditions of employment. Some legislation refers to this
conduct as “penalising” an employee, other legislation refers to it as
victimisation. If you are being victimised but not because you are claiming
your rights under certain employment legislation then the issue may be <a shape="rect" href="../equality_in_work/harassment_at_work.html">harassment</a>
or <a shape="rect" href="../equality_in_work/bullying_in_the_workplace.html">bullying</a> in the
workplace.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l64df6">Employment legislation prohibiting
victimisation</h2>

<p><strong>Minimum wage</strong></p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0005/index.html">National
Minimum Wage Act 2000</a> prohibits your employer from victimising you for
exercising your rights under the Act. If you are due a pay increase under this
Act you may not be victimised by your employer, for example, by a reduction in
your hours of work.</p>

<p><strong>Employment equality</strong><br>
If you brought a claim or gave evidence in proceedings against your employer
under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0021/index.html">Employment
Equality Acts 1998-2015</a> you are protected against victimisation. If you are
victimised by your employer you may bring another claim to the <a href="labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace Relations Commission</a>
– see ‘How to apply’ below. Your employer may be obliged to pay you
compensation. This applies whether or not you lost your original case against
your employer.</p>

<p><strong>Health and safety</strong><br>
Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0010/index.html">Safety,
Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005</a> you may not be penalised for exercising
your rights under safety and health legislation. For example, your employer may
not penalise or dismiss you for making a complaint about <a shape="rect" href="../rights_and_conditions/health_and_safety/health_safety_work.html">health
and safety at work</a> to the Health and Safety Authority</p>

<p><strong>Carer's leave</strong><br>
Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0019/index.html">Carer’s
Leave Act 2001</a> you are protected against being victimised for taking <a shape="rect" href="../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/carers_leave_from_employment.html">carer’s
leave,</a> or proposing to take it. </p>

<p><strong>Part-time employees<br></strong>If you are a <a shape="rect" href="../types_of_employment/part_time_employment/">part-time employee</a> you
may not be penalised for claiming your rights under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0045/index.html">Protection
of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed-term employees<br></strong>An employer is prohibited from victimising a <a shape="rect" href="../rights_and_conditions/contracts_of_employment/fixed_term_or_specified_purpose_contracts.html">fixed-term
employee</a> who seeks to avail of rights under the Protection of <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0029/index.html">Employees
(Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003.</a> Victimisation includes dismissal in order to
avoid a fixed-term contract being considered an open-ended contract. </p>

<p><strong>Agency workers</strong></p>

<p>An <a href="../types_of_employment/full_time_employment/agency_workers.html">agency
worker</a> is protected against being victimised for reporting breaches of the
<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0013/index.html">Protection
of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012</a>. This means that the hirer or
the agency may not penalise an agency worker by dismissal, unfair treatment or
an unfavourable change in their conditions of employment.</p>

<p><strong>Whistleblowers</strong></p>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0014/index.html">Protected
Disclosures Act 2014</a>, employees who make disclosures about wrongdoing which
comes to their attention in the workplace are protected against penalisation.
This Act applies to all employees, contractors, agency workers, members of the
Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.</p>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0022/index.html">Criminal
Justice Act 2011</a> if you disclose information to the Gardaí or give
evidence about relevant offences, your employer is prohibited from penalising
or dismissing you for this. Relevant offences are those relating to white
collar crime in areas such as banking, company law, fraud and corruption.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lc0617">Employment legislation and unfair
dismissal</h2>

<p>Other employment legislation protects you against dismissal for seeking to
avail of or availing of your rights under the legislation but does not protect
you against victimisation. If you are dismissed because of your pregnancy or
for claiming your rights under <a shape="rect" href="../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/maternity_leave.html">maternity
protection legislation</a> your dismissal is unfair. You are also protected
against unfair dismissal if you are taking or proposing to take <a shape="rect" href="../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/adoptive_leave.html">adoptive</a>,
<a shape="rect" href="../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/parental_leave.html">parental
</a>or <a shape="rect" href="../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/types_of_leave_from_work.html">force
majeure leave.</a> In these circumstances you do not need any particular period
of service with your employer in order to bring a claim for unfair dismissal
– see ‘How to apply’ below.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you have been victimised you may <a href="enforcing_your_employment_rights.html">make a complaint to the
Workplace Relations Commission</a>. You should use the <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">online
complaint form available on workplacerelations.ie</a>. The complaint must be
brought within 6 months of the last act of victimisation or the date of
dismissal. This time limit can be increased to 12 months when there is
"reasonable cause" for the delay. </p>

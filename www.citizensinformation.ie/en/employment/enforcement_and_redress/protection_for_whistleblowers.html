<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0014/index.html">Protected
Disclosures Act 2014</a> aims to protect people who raise concerns about
possible wrongdoing in the workplace. The Act, which came into effect on 15
July 2014, is often called the whistleblower legislation. It provides for
redress for employees who are <a href="../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">dismissed</a>
or otherwise <a href="victimisation_at_work.html">penalised</a> for having
reported possible wrongdoing in the workplace.</p>

<p>The Act’s definition of the term worker includes employees or former
employees, trainees, people working under a contract for services, independent
contractors, agency workers, people on work experience and the Gardaí. The
legislation does not specifically name volunteers as being covered but
guidelines to be developed for public bodies (see ‘Employers’
obligations’ below) will include how to treat disclosures by volunteers.</p>

<p>Before the 2014 Act came into effect, certain sectors, such as health, were
already covered by protected disclosures legislation – see ‘Further
information’ below.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l9f450">Protected disclosures</h2>

<p>Under the Act, you make a protected disclosure if you are a worker and you
disclose relevant information in a particular way. Information is relevant if
it came to your attention in connection with your work and you reasonably
believe that it tends to show wrongdoing. This wrongdoing may be occurring or
suspected to be occurring either inside or outside of the country. Even if the
information is proved to be incorrect, you are still protected by the Act
provided you had a reasonable belief in the information. </p>

<p>Wrongdoing is widely defined in the Act and includes the commission of
criminal offences, failure to comply with legal obligations, endangering the
health and safety of individuals, damaging the environment, miscarriage of
justice, misuse of public funds, and oppressive, discriminatory, grossly
negligent or grossly mismanaged acts or omissions by a public body. The
definition also includes the concealment or destruction of information about
any of the above wrongdoing. </p>

<p>Any wrongdoing which it is your or your employer’s function to detect,
investigate or prosecute does not come within the terms of the Act. </p>

<h3>Retaining anonymity </h3>

<p>In general, people who receive protected disclosures or who subsequently
deal with them may not disclose any information to another person which may
identify the person who made the disclosure. There are some exceptions to this,
for example, if identifying the whistleblower is essential to the effective
investigation of the matter or is required in order to prevent crime or risks
to State security, public health or the environment. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="le94ae">Reporting concerns</h2>

<p>There are different ways in which you can report a concern. Different
standards apply depending on the person or body to whom you disclose. The Act
sets out a tiered disclosure system to ensure that most reports are made to the
employer. </p>

<h3>Disclosure to employer </h3>

<p>The simplest form of disclosure is to your employer where all that is
required is a reasonable belief that the information disclosed shows or tends
to show that the wrongdoing is occurring. If you are or were employed in a
public body, you may choose, as an alternative, to report to the relevant
Minister. </p>

<h3>Disclosure to a prescribed body </h3>

<p>You may choose to report to one of the prescribed bodies listed in <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/si/0339.html">SI 339/2014</a> as
amended by <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/si/448/made/en/print">SI
448/2015</a>. In general these bodies have regulatory functions in the area
which are the subject of the allegations. </p>

<p>A disclosure you make to a prescribed body is a protected disclosure if: </p>
<ul><li>You reasonably believe that the relevant wrongdoing is within the remit
    of the prescribed body and</li>
  <li>The information you disclose and any allegation in it are substantially
    true (this is a higher standard than is required for disclosure to your
    employer)</li>
</ul><h3>Disclosure to an external person </h3>

<p>A disclosure made to an external person, for example, a journalist, may be a
protected disclosure if it meets a number of conditions: </p>
<ul><li>You must reasonably believe that the information disclosed, and any
    allegation contained in it, are substantially true </li>
  <li>The disclosure must not be made for personal gain</li>
  <li>At least one of these conditions must be met: 
    <ul><li>At the time you make the disclosure you must reasonably believe that
        you will be penalised if you make the disclosure to the employer, a
        prescribed body or a Minister </li>
      <li>Where there is no relevant prescribed body, you reasonably believe
        that it is likely that the evidence will be concealed or destroyed if
        you make the disclosure to the employer</li>
      <li>You have previously made a disclosure of substantially the same
        information to the employer, a prescribed body or a Minister </li>
      <li>The wrongdoing is of an exceptionally serious nature</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul><p>In all these circumstances, it is reasonable for you to make the disclosure
to an external person. The assessment of what is reasonable takes account of,
among other things, the identity of the person to whom the disclosure is made,
the seriousness of the wrongdoing, and whether any action had been taken in
cases where a previous disclosure was made. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l581ba">Redress for employees</h2>

<p>The Act provides for redress for employees who are penalised because they
made a protected disclosure. You are penalised if there is any act or omission
that is detrimental to you, for example, dismissal, unfair treatment or threats
of reprisal. </p>

<p>A disclosure is assumed to be protected until the contrary is proved. Under
the Protected Disclosures Act, it is the employer who has to prove that the
disclosure is not protected within the meaning of the Act. </p>

<h3>Dismissal </h3>

<p>If you are dismissed from your employment because you made a protected
disclosure, that dismissal is regarded as unfair. You may make a claim for <a href="../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfair
dismissal</a> and if your claim succeeds, you may be awarded compensation of up
to 5 years’ pay. (Generally, the maximum compensation in unfair dismissal
cases is 2 years’ pay). Unfair dismissal protection does not generally apply
to employees with less than 1 year service, trainees or Gardaí. These
restrictions do not apply where the dismissal is because of making a protected
disclosure. (The restriction on members of the Defence Forces continues to
apply). </p>

<p>Your motivation for making a protected disclosure may affect the level of
compensation you are awarded. If the investigation of the wrongdoing was not
your only or main motivation for making the disclosure, then the compensation
awarded to you may be up to 25% less than it would otherwise be.</p>

<h3>Penalties other than dismissal </h3>

<p>If you make a protected disclosure, your employer is prohibited from
penalising or threatening to penalise you or causing or permitting anyone else
to do so. If you are penalised or threatened, you may make a complaint to the
Workplace Relations Commission – see ‘How to apply’ below. </p>

<h3>Civil actions </h3>

<p>The Act provides for immunity from civil actions for damages – in effect,
you cannot be successfully sued for making a protected disclosure. You may sue
a person who causes detriment to you because you made a protected disclosure.
However, you may not do this and also look for redress under the unfair
dismissals legislation or make a complaint to the Workplace Relations
Commission. If you are charged with unlawfully disclosing information, it is a
defence that you were making what you reasonably thought to be a protected
disclosure. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you are dismissed or penalised for making a protected disclosure, you may
bring a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission using the <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">online
complaint form</a> available on workplacerelations.ie. You should make a
complaint within 6 months (or within 12 months if there is a reasonable cause).
</p>

<p>The <a href="rights_commissioner.html">adjudicator's</a> decision on your
complaint may require your employer to take a specific course of action and/or
may award compensation.</p>

<p><strong>Appeals:</strong> You or your employer may appeal the adjudicator's
decision to the <a href="employment_appeals.html">Labour Court</a>. The
Labour Court may refer a question of law arising in the case to the High Court.
The High Court’s decision on the matter is final. You or your employer may
appeal the Labour Court’s decision on a point of law to the High Court.
Again, the decision of the High Court is final. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l23f7d">Further information</h2>

<p>Information on your rights and entitlements under employment legislation is
provided by the <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Workplace_Relations_Services/Info_Cust_Serv/">Workplace
Relations Commission’s Information and Customer Service.</a></p>

<p></p>

<p>The <a href="http://transparency.ie/helpline">Transparency Legal Advice
Centre (TLAC)</a> provides free legal advice to anyone who wishes to disclose
wrongdoing, particularly under the Protected Disclosures Act. Access is via the
Speak Up helpline on 1800 844 866.</p>

<h3>Employers’ obligations </h3>

<p>Public bodies such as government departments, local authorities and certain
other publicly-funded bodies are obliged to establish and maintain procedures
for the making of protected disclosures by workers who are or were employed by
it and for dealing with such disclosures. The public bodies must provide their
employees with written information relating to these procedures. They must also
publish an annual report setting out the number of protected disclosures made
to them and the action taken in respect of these disclosures. </p>

<p>There is no similar obligation on private sector employers. The Workplace
Relations Commission has published the <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Good_Workplace_Relations/codes_practice/COP12/">Code
of Practice on Protected Disclosures Act 2014</a>. It sets out in practical
terms how a disclosure might be made and how an employer ought to handle such a
disclosure. </p>

<h3>Other whistleblower legislation</h3>

<p>Before the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 came into effect, some sectors
were already covered by protected disclosures legislation. The Health Act 2004,
as amended by the Health Act 2007, provides for the protection of employees and
members of the public who disclose possible wrongdoing within the health
sector. The Protections for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998 provides
protection from victimisation and civil liability for people reporting the
abuse of children. The Charities Act 2009 provides for the protection of people
who report alleged breaches of the legislation to the Charities Regulatory
Authority. There are also arrangements in place in a number of other sectors.
These sectoral arrangements are generally not limited to disclosures by
employees but may also cover disclosures by members of the public. These
sectoral arrangements remain in place but are amended in some respects by the
Protected Disclosures Act 2014. The specific arrangements for the Garda
Confidential Recipient have been abolished and replaced by the 2014 Act. </p>

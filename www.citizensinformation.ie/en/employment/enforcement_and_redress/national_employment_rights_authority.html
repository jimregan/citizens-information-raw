<p>The <a href="labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace Relations
Commission (WRC)</a> aims to secure compliance with employment rights
legislation through inspection and prosecution services. These services were
formerly operated by the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA). Under the
<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/en/act/pub/0016/index.html">Workplace
Relations Act 2015</a>, which came into effect on 1 October 2015, the WRC
monitors employment conditions through its Inspection Services to ensure the
compliance and enforcement of employment rights legislation. </p>

</ul><p>Inspectors may enter premises at reasonable times, interview employers and
employees, take statements, examine and take copies of records and initiate
legal proceedings. If necessary, inspectors may be accompanied by other
inspectors or the Gardaí. They may apply to the District Court for search
warrants. You can read this <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Employers_Guide_to_Inspections.pdf">employer’s
guide to inspections (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>Inspections are either carried out to investigate a specific complaint, or
else a team of inspectors may carry out random or targeted inspections in a
particular sector of employment. Where an initial inspection of records finds
that that there have been breaches of employment law, the Inspection Services
may:</p>
<ul><li>Issue a letter asking the employer to correct this or </li>
  <li>Refer the matter to legal services for prosecution or</li>
  <li>Carry out a further inspection</li>
</ul><p>In the case of unpaid wages due to an employee, a letter is then sent
requesting evidence that the employer is complying with the law as instructed.
If there is no response or an inadequate response to the letter, a second
inspection follows together with a warning that any further or new breaches
discovered will be sent to legal services to prosecute</p>

<p>An exception to the above procedures occurs where breaches of the Protection
of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996 are found. These are referred for
prosecution after a first inspection.</p>

<p>Inspectors are empowered to work in Joint Investigation Units with the
Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners, and to exchange
information with these bodies.</p>

<h3>Prosecutions</h3>

<p>Under the Workplace Relations Act 2015, the WRC has the power under a number
of employment laws to bring summary prosecutions against employers who are
alleged to be in breach of the law. The Act provides that, where a person is
convicted of an offence under it, the court must order that person to pay the
WRC the costs and expenses incurred by it in relation to the investigation,
detection and prosecution of the offence, unless the court is satisfied that
there are special and substantial reasons for not doing this. However, this
requirement to pay costs and expenses does not apply to the offence of refusing
or failing to pay compensation when ordered to do so by the District Court,
when that court is enforcing a decision of an <a href="rights_commissioner.html">adjudication officer</a> or the <a href="employment_appeals.html">Labour Court</a>.</p>

<h3>Compliance notices</h3>

<p>The Act provides for the serving of compliance notices on employers, which
is a new procedure. An inspector may serve a <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Inspections/Compliance_Notice/">compliance
notice</a> on an employer if satisfied that a contravention of the relevant
legislation has occurred. This notice specifies how that contravention is to be
rectified. An employer may appeal against the compliance notice to the Labour
Court within 42 days. There is a further appeal from the decision of the Labour
Court to the Circuit Court. It is an offence for an employer to fail to comply
with a compliance notice.</p>

<p>The existence of a compliance notice or any dispute about it does not
prevent employees from taking action in relation to any alleged breach of
employment law in respect of them. Neither does it prevent any prosecution for
an offence under employment laws.</p>

<p>Compliance notices may be used in relation to breaches of the legislation
listed in <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/16/schedule/4/enacted/en/html#sched4">Schedule
4</a> of the Workplace Relations Act 2015.</p>

<h3>Fixed payment notices</h3>

<p>The Act provides for using fixed payment notices for certain offences, which
is also a new procedure. Inspectors may issue <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Inspections/Fixed_Payment_Notice/">fixed
payment notices</a> for amounts up to €2,000 where they have reasonable cause
to believe that a person has committed a relevant offence. The fine must be
paid within 42 days. The relevant offences are:</p>
<ul><li>Breaches of the obligation on employers to consult representatives of
    employees and to provide information to them under the Protection of
    Employment Act 1977 (collective redundancies)</li>
  <li>Failure to provide a statement of wages and deductions from wages under
    the Payment of Wages Act 1991, or</li>
  <li>Failure to provide an employee with a statement of the average hourly
    rate of pay for a pay reference period under the National Minimum Wage Act
    2000</li>
</ul></div>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>People working have certain rights under employment law such as a <a shape="rect" href="../rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/pay_inc_min_wage.html">minimum
wage</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/annual_leave_public_holidays.html">annual
leave</a>. If you are not getting your rights or entitlements or if you lose
your job and consider your dismissal was unfair, there are various
organisations which can assist you to enforce your rights – see 'How to
apply' below. Since 1 October 2015, the main organisations involved in
employment rights enforcement are the <a href="labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace Relations Commission</a>
and the <a href="employment_appeals.html">Labour Court</a>. </p>

<h3>Reform of employment rights structures</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/en/act/pub/0016/index.html">Workplace
Relations Act 2015</a> came into effect on 1 October 2015. It reorganised and
reformed the existing employment rights structures as follows:</p>
<ul><li>The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) replaced the Labour Relations
    Commission, Rights Commissioner Service, Equality Tribunal, and National
    Employment Rights Authority. It is now the body of first instance, that is,
    where all complaints are first made. All hearings are now heard by a single
    adjudicator. </li>
  <li>The Labour Court now deals with all workplace relations appeals,
    including those formerly heard by the Employment Appeals Tribunal</li>
  <li>The time limits for lodging complaints and appeals have been
  standardised</li>
  <li>Reasoned, written decisions of all adjudications will now be
  published</li>
  <li>There are new mechanisms to encourage employment law compliance and to
    deal with non-compliance</li>
  <li>A WRC Information and Customer Service has been set up to encourage the
    resolution of disputes in the workplace</li>
  <li>An Early Resolution Service aims to facilitate resolution of disputes
    without the need to resort to a hearing or inspection</li>
</ul><h3>Workplace Relations Commission</h3>

<p>The Workplace Relations Commission’s main function is to promote the
improvement of workplace relations. It is the body to which all workplace
relations disputes and all disputes and complaints about employment laws are
presented.</p>

<p>It resolves disputes by providing a range of services to employers,
employees and trade unions. They include inspection of employment rights
compliance and the provision of information, mediation, conciliation, advisory
and adjudication services. The WRC now deals with disputes about equality and
discrimination.</p>

<p>It has published the <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Guide-to-Employment-Equality-and-Labour-law-final-June-2016-.pdf">Guide
to Employment, Labour and Equality Law (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>The Labour Court</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/WR_Bodies/Labour_Court/Labour_Court.html">Labour
Court</a> may investigate industrial disputes in certain circumstances. It also
deals with all workplace relations appeals, so you may appeal to it against
decisions of an adjudicator. The Employment Appeals Tribunal continues to hear
appeals submitted before the commencement of the Workplace Relations Act on 1
October 2015.</p>

<h3>Victimisation</h3>

<p>Some employment legislation prohibits employers from victimising or
penalising employees who try to enforce or are enforcing their employment
rights. Examples of <a href="victimisation_at_work.html">victimisation</a>
are less favourable treatment than other employees, or dismissal.</p>

<h3>Compensation payments and tax</h3>

<p>If you are awarded a compensation payment as a result of an employment
rights claim, in certain cases the payment may be exempt from income tax under
Section 7 of the Finance Act 2004. The exemption applies to payments arising
out of recommendations or decisions by a relevant authority following a formal
hearing or mediation. You can read more details about this in Revenue’s
leaflet, <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it71.html">Exemption
from Income Tax – IT 71</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace Relations
Commission (WRC)</a> now deals with all complaints of discrimination in
employment and access to goods and services. These complaints (formerly handled
by the Equality Tribunal whose functions were transferred to the WRC on 1
October 2015) come under the following equality legislation:</p>
<ul><li>The Employment Equality Acts 1998–2015, which outlaw discrimination at
    work including as regards: recruitment and promotion; equal pay; working
    conditions; training or experience; dismissal; and harassment, including
    sexual harassment. You can find out more about this legislation in our
    document, <a href="../equality_in_work/equality_in_the_workplace.html">Equality in
    the workplace</a>.</li>
  <li>The Equal Status Acts 2000–2015, which outlaw discrimination outside
    the workplace, in particular in the provision of goods and services; in
    selling, renting or leasing property (including the "<a href="https://www.ihrec.ie/your-rights/i-have-an-issue-with-a-service/i-have-an-issue-about-accommodation/">housing
    assistance ground</a>") and in certain aspects of education <a href="http://www.ihrec.ie/your-rights/housing-assistance.html"></a></li>
</ul><p>There is information about <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/What_You_Should_Know/Employment_Equality/">employment
equality</a> and <a href="http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/What_You_Should_Know/Equal_Status/">equal
status</a>, as well as a <a href="http://workplacerelations.ie/en/Frequently_Asked_Questions/Employment_Equality_and_Equal_Status/">list
of frequently asked questions</a>, on workplacerelations.ie. The <a href="../../justice/law_and_rights/irish_human_rights_commission.html">Irish
Human Rights and Equality Commission</a> also provides information to the
public on equality legislation.</p>

<p>Victimisation is also covered by equality legislation. Victimisation occurs
when a person is treated less favourably than another because they opposed
discrimination or were involved in a complaint of unlawful discrimination.</p>

<p>The Workplace Relations Commission also deals with complaints of
discrimination on the grounds of gender under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0025/index.html">Pensions
Acts 1990–2015</a> in relation to occupational benefit or pensions schemes.
However, it cannot deal with complaints about licensed premises and registered
clubs. To pursue a complaint about a licensed premises or registered club you
must take your case to the <a href="../../justice/courts_system/district_court.html">District
Court</a>.</p>

<p>The 2 methods of handling equality or discrimination disputes are mediation
and adjudication</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l8ca29">Mediation</h2>

<p>When you make your complaint under equality legislation, you may be offered
mediation. It is a voluntary and confidential process. Mediation is an attempt
to get agreement between the parties. At the end of mediation both sides sign
an agreement which is legally binding so that both sides must keep to the terms
of the decision. Mediation is held in private and the agreement is not
published. If you do not reach an agreement through mediation you can request
your case be brought to investigation. </p>

<p>Mediation is held in private and the agreement is not published. If you do
not reach an agreement through mediation, your case will be referred to an <a href="rights_commissioner.html">adjudication officer</a>. You can read more
about <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Mediation/">mediation
on workplacerelations.ie</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l910ea">Adjudication</h2>

<p>If mediation is not used or is not successful, the complaint or dispute is
referred to an adjudication officer who will conduct an inquiry and issue a
legally binding decision. Remedies will include one or more of the following:
compensation, an order for equal pay or equal treatment, and/or an order that
somebody take a specified action.</p>

<p>Advice may be available from a trade union, support group, <a href="http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/">Citizens Information Centre</a>
or the <a href="../../justice/law_and_rights/irish_human_rights_commission.html">Irish
Human Rights and Equality Commission</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>In general, complaints under the Employment Equality Acts 1998–2015 and
complaints about discrimination in pensions must be brought within 6 months.
You should make your complaint using the online complaint form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.
The time limit can be extended by a further 6 months for "reasonable cause".</p>

<p>To make a complaint under the Equal Status Acts 2000–2015 you must first
notify the person or organisation you are making the complaint against within
<strong>2 <span>months</span></strong> of the last act of discrimination. To do
this you complete <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Form-ES-1-Equal-Status-Complaint-Notification1.pdf">ES.1
form (pdf)</a> and send it to the person or organisation you are making the
complaint against. The time limit for notification can be extended to 4 months
by the Director General of the Workplace Relations Commission. If you are not
satisfied with the service provider's response, or if they have made no
response within 1 month from the date you notified them, and you wish to pursue
the complaint, you should use the <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">online
complaint form available on workplacerelations.ie</a>. </p>

<p>All decisions of an adjudication officer can be appealed, to the <a href="employment_appeals.html">Labour Court</a> for employment and pensions
cases and to the <a href="../../justice/courts_system/circuit_court.html">Circuit Court</a> for
equal status cases, within 42 days of the issue of the decision.</p>

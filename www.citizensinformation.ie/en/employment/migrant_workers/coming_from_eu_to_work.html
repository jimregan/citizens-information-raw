<p>As an EU national you are entitled to come to Ireland to take up employment
or self-employment. You do not need an employment permit. Nationals from the
other countries of the European Economic Area (EEA), that is, Norway, Iceland
and Liechtenstein, and Switzerland do not need employment permits to work in
Ireland.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Residence </h3>

<p>If you are an <a href="https://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Who-needs-an-Employment-Permit-/European-Economic-Area-EEA-/">EEA</a>
or Swiss national you and your family members have the right to come to Ireland
for 3 months with no conditions attached under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/si/548/made/en/print">European
Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2015</a> which implement an
EU Directive on the free movement of persons. You then have the right of
residence for longer than 3 months if: </p>
<ul><li>You are <a shape="rect" href="../types_of_employment/full_time_employment/types_of_employment.html">employed
    or self-employed</a> </li>
</ul><p>or</p>
<ul><li>You have enough resources so that you and your dependants do not become a
    burden on the social assistance system and you have comprehensive sickness
    insurance </li>
</ul><p>or</p>
<ul><li>You are a student, you can maintain yourself, you have a place in an
    educational institution and you have sickness insurance. </li>
</ul><p>EEA and Swiss nationals are not required to register with the immigration
authorities. Family members of EU citizens who are not themselves EEA or Swiss
nationals are required to <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/rights_of_residence_in_ireland/registration_of_non_eea_nationals_in_ireland.html">register
with the immigration authorities</a> and apply for a residence card under <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/EU%20Treaty%20Rights">EU Treaty
Rights</a>. You can read more in our document on <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/rights_of_residence_in_ireland/residence_rights_eu_national.html">the
residence rights of EEA nationals</a>. </p>

<h3>Returning to Ireland</h3>

<p>If you are an Irish citizen who has worked in another EEA country and are
returning to Ireland, you are officially a migrant worker under EU legislation.
This means that, among other things, your social security rights are
extensively affected by EU Regulations.</p>

<h3>Social security</h3>

<p><span>If you are unemployed,</span> your unemployment benefit in the country
you are leaving may be transferred after you have been receiving it for 4
weeks. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Policy/EU/Pages/SocInsandECReg.aspx">Under EU
Regulations you can ask for it to be transferred to Ireland</a> and you should
bring a copy of the form U2 (which is replacing form E303) with details of your
payment. You must, of course, comply with the rules for getting benefit in the
country that you are leaving. When you arrive in Ireland, you should sign on at
your local social welfare office - see 'Where to apply' below within a week.
You may then receive your benefit for 13 weeks (up to 26 weeks in some cases).
You get the same benefit as you would get if you stayed in the country you have
left. You are entitled to medical card services in Ireland while you are
receiving unemployment benefit from the other country.</p>

<p>After 13 weeks have expired, you will be in the normal Irish social welfare
system. In order to qualify for benefits in Ireland, you need to get a job and
pay at least one Class A PRSI contribution. At this point, your contributions
from the other country you worked in may be added to your Irish contribution(s)
to help you qualify for benefits. </p>

<p>When you are coming to Ireland you should bring a record of your
contributions on Forms U1 (formerly E301) and E104 from the social security
institution in the country you are leaving. These forms will help speed up the
payment of benefits under EU Regulations.</p>

<p><span>If you are employed</span> when you come to Ireland then you are
covered by the normal Irish rules relating to social welfare.</p>

<p><strong>Habitual residence</strong></p>

<p>Under EU Regulations, EEA and Swiss citizens and non-EEA nationals who have
previously worked in another EEA state, are <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Habitual-Residence-Condition--Guidelines-for-Deciding-Offic.aspx#sect3">exempt
from the habitual residence condition for family benefits</a> provided they are
employed or self-employed in Ireland and subject to the Irish social welfare
system.</p>

<p>EEA workers will satisfy the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitual
residence condition</a> for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary
Welfare Allowance</a> but people from the EU/EEA who move to Ireland in search
of employment are subject to the habitual residence test in the normal way
while looking for work. </p>

<h3>Rights while working in Ireland</h3>

<p>As an EEA national working in Ireland, you are entitled to exactly the same
rights as Irish citizens with regard to social welfare, <a href="../employment_rights_and_conditions/">employment rights</a> and social
rights in general. As soon as you come to Ireland you should <a shape="rect" href="coming_to_ie_tax.html">register for tax and social insurance</a> by
applying for a <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">Personal
Public Service (PPS) number</a>. If you need help <a shape="rect" href="finding_a_job_when_you_move_to_ireland.html">finding a job in Ireland</a>
you can get advice on employment and training opportunities from your <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Employment-Services-Offices.aspx">local
employment services office. </a></p>

<p><a>If you are post</a>ed here by your employer on a temporary basis, you are
entitled to the equivalent of medical card services. If you are employed or
self-employed and staying on a permanent basis, you come under the same rules
for <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/entitlement_to_public_health_services.html">entitlement
to health services</a> as Irish nationals generally. Therefore, you must pass a
means test to get a <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical
card.</a> </p>

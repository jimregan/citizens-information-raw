<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Most non-EEA nationals must have an employment permit in order to work in
Ireland. Under the <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/en_act_2006_0016.htm">Employment
Permits Acts 2003–2014</a> there is a specific employment permit (EP) for
spouses, partners and dependants of <a href="green_card_permits.html">Critical Skills Employment Permit</a> holders
and researchers. To be eligible for a Dependant/Partner/Spouse (DPS) EP the
applicant must be legally resident in Ireland. Normally, the dependant must be
a family member aged under 18 – see ‘Who can apply’ in the Rules section
below. </p>

<p>Since 1 October 2014, the Dependant/Partner/Spouse Employment Permit applies
to spouses, recognised partners, civil partners and dependants of holders of
Critical Skills Employment Permits, former Green Card permits and researchers.
The scheme makes it easier for eligible spouses, partners and dependants to
access employment because: </p>
<ul><li>Employers do not have to advertise the job with Department of Social
    Protection employment services/EURES before making the
    Dependant/Partner/Spouse Employment Permit application – known as the
    <em>labour market needs test </em></li>
  <li>The spouse, partner or dependant can apply for any job vacancy other than
    in a domestic setting, with the exception of certain carers </li>
  <li>First applications and renewals for Dependant/Partner/Spouse Employment
    Permits are exempt from the usual application fee </li>
</ul><h3>Spouses, partners and dependants of other employment permit holders</h3>

<p>Dependant/Partner/Spouse Employment Permits are not available to spouses,
partners and dependants of holders of <a href="work_permits.html">General
Employment Permits (formerly work permits)</a> or <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Permit-Types/">other
types of employment permit</a>. They must apply for an employment permit in
their own right. Applying for a General Employment Permit means:</p>
<ul><li>A <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Labour-Market-Needs-Test/">labour
    market needs test</a> will be required </li>
  <li>Fees are payable when applying for or renewing an employment permit</li>
  <li>Applications for General Employment Permits will not be considered for <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Ineligible-Categories-of-Employment/">occupations
    listed as ineligible </a>for employment permits </li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Who can apply</h3>

<p>Dependant/Partner/Spouse Employment Permits apply only to spouses, partners
or dependants legally resident in Ireland. Applications for spouses, partners
or dependants living outside Ireland must go through the normal employment
permit procedures. </p>

<p>In order to be eligible to apply for a Dependant/Partner/Spouse Employment
Permit the following criteria must be met: </p>

<p>(a) The applicant and the employment permit holder must be married, in a <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/De-Facto-Relationships/">recognised
partnership</a> or in a civil partnership (as recognised by the Department of
Justice and Equality). In general, a dependant must be a family member who is
unmarried and aged under 18 - see 'Dependants' below.</p>

<p>(b) The employment permit holder must have one of the following:</p>
<ul><li>A valid Critical Skills EP</li>
  <li>A valid Green Card permit</li>
  <li>A valid employment permit or <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Researchers">hosting
    agreement</a> in respect of a researcher position </li>
</ul><p>(c) The employment permit holder must still be working within the terms of
their permit.</p>

<p>Spouses, partners and dependants of people who once held Critical Skills,
Green Card or researcher permits but who have now got permission to work in
Ireland without a permit, may also be eligible for a Dependant/Partner/Spouse
Employment Permit.</p>

<h3>Application procedures</h3>

<p>The following employment permit arrangements apply to the
Dependant/Partner/Spouse Employment Permit.</p>
<ul><li>Either the employer or employee can apply for the employment permit,
    based on an offer of employment. </li>
  <li>The employment permit is granted to the employee and includes a statement
    of the employee's rights and entitlements </li>
  <li>A copy of the employment permit is sent to the employer </li>
  <li>The employer is prohibited from deducting recruitment expenses from the
    employee's pay or retaining the employee's personal documents </li>
</ul><h3>Job offer</h3>

<p>The spouse, partner or dependant must have a job offer and must have the
qualifications, skills and experience required for the job. They must be
directly employed and paid by their employer in Ireland. Job offers from
recruitment agencies and other intermediaries are not acceptable under the
scheme. They may work for a minimum of 10 hours a week. The pay can be less
than €30,000 a year but they must be paid at least the <a href="../../employment_rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/pay_inc_min_wage.html">National
Minimum Wage hourly rate</a>.</p>

<p>The employer must be trading in Ireland, registered with Revenue and with
the Companies Registration Office. A Dependant/Partner/Spouse Employment Permit
will not be issued to companies where the granting of the permit would mean
that more than 50% of the employees would be non-EEA nationals. This
requirement may be waived if the applicant will be the sole employee of the
employer.</p>

<h3>Dependants</h3>

<p>Dependant/Partner/Spouse Employment Permits are available only to dependent
unmarried children aged under 18, who are resident in Ireland as family members
of the employment permit holder. In exceptional cases Dependant/Partner/Spouse
Employment Permits may be available to dependants aged over 18, who became
legally resident in Ireland before the age of 18.</p>

<h3>Duration and renewal </h3>

<p>The Dependant/Partner/Spouse Employment Permit is normally issued for the
period up to the expiry date of the Certificate of Registration of the
employment permit holder. It can then be renewed - see 'How to apply' below. If
you have completed 5 consecutive years’ work on an employment permit you will
no longer need a permit to work in Ireland. <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Policy%20for%205%20year%20workers%20and%20redundant%20workers">You
should contact your local immigration officer to change your immigration
permission.</a> </p>

<h3>Changing job</h3>

<p>Someone working on a Dependant/Partner/Spouse Employment Permit is expected
to stay with the original employer for 12 months unless there are exceptional
circumstances. After that it is possible to change job provided a new
application for a Dependant/Partner/Spouse Employment Permit is made.</p>

<p>When a Dependant/Partner/Spouse Employment Permit is issued to an eligible
spouse, partner or dependant, they need to re-register with the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/registration-appointment-system">Burgh
Quay Registration Office</a> (if living in Dublin) or the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/registration-offices">regional
registration office</a> or local <a href="http://www.garda.ie/Stations/Default.aspx">Garda District
Headquarters</a> (if living outside Dublin). This is in order to obtain
permission to remain in the State as an employee. It is important to do this as
otherwise the spouse, partner or dependant will not have the correct
immigration status. </p>

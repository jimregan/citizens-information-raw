<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are a national from a country which is not in the European Economic
Area (EEA) or Switzerland, in general you will need an employment permit to
work in Ireland. Under the <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/en_act_2006_0016.htm">Employment
Permits Acts 2003–2014</a> there are 9 types of employment permit including a
Critical Skills Employment Permit (formerly Green Card permit), a <a href="work_permits.html">General Employment Permit (formerly work
permit)</a> and a <a href="spousal_work_permit_scheme.html">Dependant/Partner/Spouse Employment
Permit</a>.</p>

<p>Since 1 October 2014, the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0026/index.html">Employment
Permits (Amendment) Act 2014</a> has changed the current employment permits
system through the provision of <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Permit-Types/">9
different types of employment permit</a> and changes to the criteria for
issuing employment permits. The Act also provides that a foreign national
without an employment permit, who took all reasonable steps to obtain one, may
be allowed to take civil action against the employer for compensation for work
done or services rendered. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Critical Skills Employment Permits are issued by the Department of Jobs,
Enterprise and Innovation. Either the employer or the employee can apply for
the permit which must be based on an offer of employment – see 'How to apply'
below. The permit is granted to the employee and includes a statement of the
employee's rights and entitlements. An employee working on an employment permit
is protected by <a href="../../employment_rights_and_conditions/">employment
legislation</a> in exactly the same way as other employees.</p>

<h3>Eligible occupations</h3>

<p>There are 2 categories of eligible occupations for a Critical Skills
Employment Permit as follows:<br>
(1) Jobs with annual salaries of €60,000 or more – all occupations (other
than <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Ineligible-Categories-of-Employment/">certain
ineligible job categories</a> and those which are contrary to the public
interest)</p>

<p>(2) Jobs with annual salaries of €30,000 or more – the occupation must
be on the <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Highly-Skilled-Eligible-Occupations-List/">Highly
Skilled Occupations List</a>.</p>

<p>Since 10 April 2013, <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Initiatives/">non-EEA
nationals with a stamp 1, 1A, 2, 2A or 3 residence permission</a>, who have
been offered a job in an occupation on the Highly Skilled Occupations List, may
apply for an employment permit.</p>

<h3>Job offer</h3>

<p>You must have a job offer from a company or employer who is registered with
Revenue, trading in Ireland and registered with the Companies Registration
Office. You must be directly employed and paid by your employer in Ireland. Job
offers from recruitment agencies and other intermediaries are not acceptable
under the scheme. The job offer must be for 2 years or more.</p>

<h3>Labour market needs test</h3>

<p>A labour market needs test is not required, that is the employer does not
need to advertise the job with the Department of Social Protection employment
services/EURES or in newspapers. However, an employment permit will not be
granted to companies if the granting of the permit would mean that more than
50% of the employees would be non-EEA nationals. This requirement may be waived
in the case of start-up companies which are supported by Enterprise Ireland or
IDA Ireland.</p>

<h3>Qualifications<br></h3>

<p>You must have the relevant qualifications, skills and experience required
for the job. For jobs in the €30,000 or more salary range you must have a
degree qualification or higher. For jobs with an annual salary of €60,000 or
over, you must have a degree or equivalent experience.</p>

<h3>Registration and permission to remain </h3>

<p>If you are not an EEA or Swiss national you must <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/rights_of_residence_in_ireland/registration_of_non_eea_nationals_in_ireland.html">register
with your local immigration officer</a> in the area where you intend to live
when you arrive in the State. In the Dublin area, the registration is done at
the Burgh Quay Registration Office. Since 15 September 2016, you must <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/registration-appointment-system">book
an appointment online</a> to visit it. If you are living outside Dublin, you
should register at your <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/registration-offices">regional
registration office</a> or your local <a href="http://www.garda.ie/Stations/Default.aspx">Garda District
Headquarters.</a> This is in order to obtain permission to remain and to ensure
you have the correct immigration status, that is, as an employee. You will be
given a Certificate of Registration which is also known as a GNIB card. </p>

<h3>Expiry of Critical Skills Employment Permit</h3>

<p>The Critical Skills (and Green Card) Employment Permit is issued for 2 years
and you are not required to renew it. Instead you apply to your local
immigration officer for a Stamp 4 permission to live and work in Ireland
without an employment permit. </p>

<p>From 1 April 2015, there is a new application procedure for this Stamp 4
permission. First, you must apply on this <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/Publications/Request-for-Support-Letter-for-Green-Card-Critical-Skills-Permit-Holders-seeking-Stamp-4.html">request
form</a> for a support letter from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and
Innovation confirming your current employment. You can find <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Permit-Types/Critical-Skills-Employment-Permit/">details
of the new procedure and the documentation required on djei.ie</a>.</p>

<p>You then register with your local immigration officer – see above. You
must have the following documents with you:</p>
<ul><li>Passport</li>
  <li>Certificate of Registration (GNIB card)</li>
  <li>Your Critical Skills or Green Card Employment Permit</li>
  <li>Letter from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation confirming
    your continuing employment</li>
</ul><p>If you are granted a Stamp 4 permission, it will be for 2 years and will be
renewable provided you continue to satisfy the criteria for it. When you have
been legally resident for 5 years, you may apply for long-term residency.</p>

<p>If you are not eligible for a Stamp 4, you may be issued with a Stamp 1 and
you will continue to need an employment permit to work in Ireland.</p>

<h3>Visas</h3>

<p>If you have a passport from a <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/coming_to_live_in_ireland/visa_requirements_for_entering_ireland.html">country
whose passport holders require a visa to enter Ireland</a> you must <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Apply%20for%20a%20visa%20%E2%80%93%20how%20to%20apply">apply
for an entry visa online</a>.</p>

<h3>Dependants </h3>

<p>You may apply to have your spouse, partner and/or minor dependent children
join you once you have obtained your Critical Skills Employment Permit. There
is <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Join%20Family">information
about family reunification on the INIS website.</a> Spouses, partners and
dependants of employees on employment permits may be able to obtain <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Permit-Types/Dependant-Partner-Spouse-Employment-Permit/">Dependant/Partner/Spouse
Employment Permits</a> provided they are legally resident here. </p>

<h3>Changing job</h3>

<p>If this is your first employment permit in Ireland then you are expected to
remain with your employer for 12 months (unless there are exceptional
circumstances). After that you may change employer provided that a new
application for a Critical Skills Employment Permit is made. </p>

<h3>Losing your job</h3>

<p>If you lose your job through redundancy you should notify the Department of

notification form</a> within 28 days of dismissal. The Department will allow
you a period of 6 months to find another job. When you find another job you can
apply for a new Critical Skills Employment Permit even if the job is now in one
of the ineligible categories. </p>

<p>You should contact your local immigration officer to confirm your
immigration status - see 'Registration' above. If you have more than 6 months
before your immigration permission expires, you can reside in Ireland under
your stamp 1 permission for 6 months. If you have less than 6 months'
immigration permission you can have your immigration permission extended to 6
months which means you will have to pay for a new Certificate of Registration -
see 'Rates' below. If you have not found a new job after 6 months you will be
expected to leave Ireland. If you then get an offer of employment in Ireland
you may apply for a new employment permit. <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Policy%20for%205%20year%20workers%20and%20redundant%20workers">Further
details about the new provisions for non-EEA nationals who are made redundant
are on the INIS website</a>. </p>

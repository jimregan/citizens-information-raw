<p>In general, non-EEA nationals must have <a href="overview_employment_permits.html">an employment permit</a> to work in
Ireland. The Reactivation Employment Permit is for non-EEA nationals who came
to Ireland on a valid employment permit, but who fell out of the system through
no fault of their own or because of exploitation in the workplace. The
Reactivation Employment Permit enables them to work legally again. The main
features of the Reactivation Employment Permit are:</p>
<ul><li>You must previously have held an employment permit</li>
  <li>You must not be currently employed</li>
  <li>You must have a job offer</li>
  <li>You must have a temporary Stamp 1 immigration permission and have a
    “Reactivation Employment Permit” letter from the Department of Justice
    and Equality – see ‘How to apply’ below</li>
  <li>A <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Labour-Market-Needs-Test/">labour
    market needs test</a> is not required</li>
  <li>It is available for all occupations, including <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Carers-in-private-homes/">certain
    carers</a> but excluding all occupations in a domestic setting, for
    example, housekeepers</li>
</ul></div>

</ul><p>You can read more about the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/REP%20Scheme%20Eligibility.pdf/Files/REP%20Scheme%20Eligibility.pdf">eligibility
criteria (pdf)</a> for the Reactivation Employment Permit.</p>

<h3>Job offer</h3>

<p>You must have a genuine job offer and you must have the qualifications,
skills and experience required for the job. You must be directly employed and
paid by your employer. The employer must be trading in Ireland, registered with
Revenue and, if applicable, with the Companies Registration Office. Your
employer cannot deduct recruitment expenses from your pay or retain your
personal documents. You must be paid at least the <a href="../../employment_rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/pay_inc_min_wage.html">National
Minimum Wage hourly rate.</a></p>

<p>A Reactivation Employment Permit will not be issued to companies where the
granting of the permit would mean that more than 50% of the employees would be
non-EEA nationals. However, this requirement may be waived where you will be
the only employee. This will also apply when you renew your permit.</p>

<h3>Duration and renewal</h3>

<p>A Reactivation Employment Permit is issued first for 2 years and then may be
renewed for a further 3 years. If you have worked for 5 consecutive years on a
work permit you may no longer need a permit to work in Ireland. When your stamp
1 permission is due for renewal your local immigration officer – see
‘Registration’ below – will issue you with a <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Policy%20for%205%20year%20workers%20and%20redundant%20workers">stamp
4 immigration permission for one year</a> which will allow you to take up any
employment but not self-employment.</p>

<p>When you have been legally living and working in Ireland for 5 years on a
work permit you can apply for <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Long_Term_Residency">long-term
residence</a> to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) - see
'Where to apply' below. You may also apply for exemption from the requirement
to have an employment permit. If your application is successful you will be
granted extended residence permission for a further 5 years and you will not
need a work permit to work in Ireland.</p>

<h3>Changing employment</h3>

<p>If this is your first Reactivation Employment Permit, you are expected to
stay with your new employer for 12 months (apart from in exceptional
circumstances). After that you may move to a new employer provided that a new
application for an employment permit is made.</p>

<h3>Losing your job</h3>

<p>If you are made redundant while you hold a Reactivation Employment Permit,
you should notify the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. The
Department will allow you 6 months to find another job. When you find another
job you will be issued with a new Reactivation Employment Permit in accordance
with the requirements of the scheme.</p>

<p>If you have not found a new job after 6 months you should contact your local
immigration officer to confirm your immigration status. If you decide to leave
the country and you then get an offer of employment in Ireland you may apply
for a new employment permit.</p>

<h3>Dependants</h3>

<p>If you have a Reactivation Employment Permit, your spouse, partner or
dependants are not eligible for a <a href="spousal_work_permit_scheme.html">Dependant/Partner/Spouse Employment
Permit.</a> They can apply for a <a href="work_permits.html">General
Employment Permit</a> in their own right.</p>

<p><strong>Applying for a Temporary Stamp 1</strong></p>

<p>You must first get a <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Reactivation%20Employment%20Permit%20Scheme">temporary
Stamp 1 immigration permission</a>. When you have a current job offer, you
apply to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) for a
Reactivation Employment Permit Permission using the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/REP%20Scheme%20Application.pdf/Files/REP%20Scheme%20Application.pdf">application

INIS – see ‘Where to apply’ below. Your application is assessed and if
you qualify, you are given a stamp 1 permission for 4 months. You must register
this permission with the GNIB – see ‘Registration’ below.</p>

<p><strong>Applying for a Reactivation Employment Permit</strong></p>

<p>You (or your prospective employer) can make a new application for a
Reactivation Employment Permit to the Employment Permits Section of the
Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. You apply using the <a href="https://epos.djei.ie/EPOSOnlineportal#/app/welcome">Employment Permits
Online System (EPOS)</a>. The supporting documentation required includes the
“Reactivation Employment Permit” letter from the Department of Justice and
Equality.</p>

<p><strong>Processing and reviews</strong></p>

<p>You can check the status of your application through the <a href="https://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Status-Form/">online
status enquiry facility</a>. The <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Current-Application-Processing-Dates/">application
processing times</a> are on the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and
Innovation’s website. The official processing your application will either
grant it or refuse it and must give specific reasons for refusal. If your
application is refused you may appeal the decision within 28 days, using the <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/publications/submission-of-a-decision-for-review-under-section-13-or-17-of-the-employment-permits-act-2006-as-amended-.html">review
of decision to refuse an employment permit form</a>.</p>

<p>Renewals</p>

<p>Either an employer or an employee can apply for a renewal using the <a href="https://epos.djei.ie/EPOSOnlineportal#/app/welcome">Employment Permits
Online System (EPOS)</a> 16 weeks before the expiry of the permit.</p>

<p><strong>Registration</strong></p>

<p>When you are issued with your Reactivation Employment Permit you need to
register with the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/registration-appointment-system">Burgh
Quay Registration Office</a> (if living in Dublin) or the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/registration-offices">regional
registration office</a> or the <a href="http://www.garda.ie/Stations/Default.aspx">local Garda District
Headquarters</a> (if living outside Dublin). You must do this to get permission
to remain in the State as an employee. It is important to do this as otherwise
you will not have the correct immigration status.</p>

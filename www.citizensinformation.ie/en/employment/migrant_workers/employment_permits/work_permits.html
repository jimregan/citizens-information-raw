<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>In general, non-EEA nationals must have an employment permit to work in
Ireland. EEA and Swiss nationals do not need an employment permit. Under the <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/en_act_2006_0016.htm">Employment
Permits Acts 2003–2014</a> there are 9 types of employment permit including a
General Employment Permit, a <a shape="rect" href="green_card_permits.html">Critical Skills Employment Permit</a> and a <a shape="rect" href="spousal_work_permit_scheme.html">Dependant/Partner/Spouse
Employment Permit</a>. You can read about other types of permit in our <a href="overview_employment_permits.html">overview document on employment
permits</a>.</p>

<p>Since 1 October 2014, the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0026/index.html">Employment
Permits (Amendment) Act 2014</a> has changed the previous employment permits
system. There are now <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Permit-Types/">9
different types of employment permit</a> with new application forms for each
type and changes to the criteria for issuing employment permits. The Act also
provides that a foreign national without an employment permit, who took all
reasonable steps to get one, can take civil action against their employer to
compensate them for work done or services rendered.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>General Employment Permits are issued by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise
and Innovation. Either the employer or the employee can apply for a permit
which must be based on an offer of employment. Permits are issued to the
employee and include a statement of the employee's rights and entitlements. An
employee with an employment permit has all the <a href="../../employment_rights_and_conditions/">employment rights</a> of Irish
or EEA citizens for the duration of the employment permit. </p>

<p>Generally applications for General Employment Permits must have a minimum
annual remuneration (pay) of €30,000. Remuneration includes the salary for
the job and health insurance. </p>

<p>Applications for jobs with annual pay of €27,000* are considered on an
exceptional basis in the following cases:</p>
<ul><li>Non-EEA students who have graduated in the last 12 months, from an Irish
    third level institution, and have been offered a graduate position from the
    <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Highly-Skilled-Eligible-Occupations-List/">Highly
    Skilled Occupations List</a></li>
  <li>Non-EEA students who have graduated in the last 12 months, from an
    overseas third level institution, and have been offered a graduate position
    as an ICT professional from the Highly Skilled Occupations List</li>
  <li>Applications for specialist language support and technical or sales
    support with a fluency in a non-EEA language for companies who are getting
    support from the State enterprise development agencies</li>
</ul><p>* The annual pay must be €30,000 when applying for a renewal of the
permit.</p>

<p>Non-EEA nationals with a <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Applying%20for%20an%20Employment%20Permit%20whilst%20already%20lawfully%20resident%20in%20the%20State">stamp
1, 1A, 2, 2A or 3 residence permission</a> may apply for a General Employment
Permit provided the job is not on the <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Ineligible-Categories-of-Employment/">list
of ineligible occupations</a>. </p>

<h3>Job offer</h3>

<p>You must have the qualifications, skills and experience required for the
job. You must be directly employed and paid by your employer. General
Employment Permit applications from recruitment agencies and other
intermediaries are not acceptable. The employer must be trading in Ireland,
registered with Revenue and with the Companies Registration Office. Your
employer cannot deduct recruitment expenses from your pay or retain your
personal documents.</p>

<p>A General Employment Permit will not be issued to companies where the
granting of the permit would mean that more than 50% of the employees would be
non-EEA nationals. However, this requirement may be waived in the case of
start-up companies or where the applicant will be the only employee.</p>

<h3>Labour market needs test </h3>

<p>All new applications for General Employment Permits include evidence that a
<a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Labour-Market-Needs-Test/">labour
market needs test</a> has been carried out. </p>

<p><strong>Waivers:</strong> Since 1 October 2014 the requirement for a labour
market needs test may be waived if the application:</p>
<ul><li>Is for a former permit holder who has been made redundant or</li>
  <li>Is for a job listed on the Highly Skilled Occupations List or</li>
  <li>Has been recommended by Enterprise Ireland or IDA Ireland or</li>
  <li>Is for a carer with a proven history of caring for the sick person or</li>
  <li>Is for a job with an annual salary of €60,000 or more</li>
</ul><p>The test requires that the vacancy must have been advertised with the <a href="http://www.jobsireland.ie/">Department of Social Protection (DSP)
employment services</a>/EURES employment network for 2 weeks, in a national
newspaper for at least 3 days and in either a local newspaper or jobs website
for 3 days. This is to ensure that an EEA or Swiss national cannot be found to
fill the vacancy. When registering the vacancy on DSP/EURES <strong>the
employer must specify that the vacancy is a potential General Employment Permit
application</strong>.</p>

<p>If the employer is unable to find an EEA or Swiss national, they must
contact their <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Employment-Services-Offices.aspx">local
employment services office</a> or <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Intreo---Contact-Information.aspx">Intreo
centre</a> within 4 weeks to ask for a decision to be made on the vacancy. In
response to the employer’s request, the employment services office will
decide whether a General Employment Permit is justified to fill the vacancy.
<strong>If the employer does not contact the local employment services office,
the advertisement will continue but no employment permit can be issued for that
vacancy</strong>.</p>

<h3>Occupations that are ineligible for employment permits</h3>

<p>Employment permits are not available for occupations listed under the
heading ‘Ineligible Employments’ on the <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Ineligible-Categories-of-Employment/">Ineligible
Categories of Employment</a> list (except for <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Carers-in-private-homes/">certain
carers</a>).</p>

<p>However, applicants for the <a href="spousal_work_permit_scheme.html">Dependant/Partner/Spouse</a> and the
<a href="reactivation_employment_permit.html">Reactivation</a> Employment
Permit Schemes can get employment permits for these occupations apart from
those taking place in a domestic setting (except for certain carers) or
contrary to public interest.</p>

<h3>Duration and renewal</h3>

<p>A General Employment Permit is issued first for 2 years and then may be
renewed for a further 3 years. If you have worked for 5 consecutive years on a
work permit you may no longer need a permit to work in Ireland. When your stamp
1 permission is due for renewal your local immigration officer – see
‘Registration’ below – will issue you with a <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Policy%20for%205%20year%20workers%20and%20redundant%20workers">stamp
4 immigration permission for one year</a> which will allow you to take up any
employment but not self-employment.</p>

<p>When you have been legally living and working in Ireland for 5 years on a
work permit you can apply for <a shape="rect" href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Long_Term_Residency">long-term
residence</a> to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) - see
'Where to apply' below. You may also apply for exemption from the requirement
to have an employment permit. If your application is successful you will be
granted extended residence permission for a further 5 years and you will not
need a work permit to work in Ireland. </p>

<h3>Changing employment</h3>

<p>If this is your first work permit in Ireland you are expected to stay with
your new employer for 12 months (apart from in exceptional circumstances).
After that you may move to a new employer provided that a new application for a
General Employment Permit has been made for a similar job or to another
eligible employment sector. </p>

<h3>Losing your job</h3>

<p>If you lose your job through redundancy, you should notify the Department of
Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation using the <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/publications/notification-of-dismissal-by-reason-of-redundancy-under-sections-20a-20b-of-the-employment-permits-act-2006-as-amended-.html">redundancy
notification form</a> within 28 days of your dismissal. <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Policy%20for%205%20year%20workers%20and%20redundant%20workers">There
are provisions for non-EEA workers</a> as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Employment permit for 5 years:</strong> <br>
If you have been made redundant after working on an employment permit for 5
consecutive years you will no longer need a permit to work in Ireland. You
should apply to your local immigration officer - see 'Registration' below who
will issue you with a stamp 4 immigration permission for one year. This
permission may be renewed annually and it will allow you to take up any
employment or <a href="../../types_of_employment/self_employment/self_employment_as_an_individual.html">become
self-employed.</a></p>

<p><strong>Employment permit for less than 5 years:</strong> <br>
The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will allow you 6 months to
find another job. <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Redundancy/">When
you find another job you have to apply for a new General Employment Permit</a>
but a labour market needs test is not required. If you were made redundant from
a job on the list of ineligible categories you may apply for a new General
Employment Permit for a job on that ineligible list. </p>

<p>You should contact your local immigration officer to confirm your
immigration status – see 'Registration' below. If you have more than 6 months
before your immigration permission expires, you can reside in Ireland under
your stamp 1 permission for a further 6 months. If you have less than 6 months'
immigration permission you can have your immigration permission extended to 6
months which means you will have to pay for a new Certificate of Registration -
see 'Rates' below. If you have not found a new job after 6 months you will be
expected to leave Ireland. If you then get an offer of employment in Ireland
you may apply for a new General Employment Permit. </p>

<p><strong>Short-time working:</strong> if you have been put on short-time
working while on a work permit or a General Employment Permit, you must notify
the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. If you do not do this any
application to renew your permit in future may be affected.</p>

<h3>Visas</h3>

<p>If you are a <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/coming_to_live_in_ireland/visa_requirements_for_entering_ireland.html">national
who requires a visa</a>, you should obtain a visa before travelling to Ireland.
You must <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Apply%20for%20a%20visa%20%E2%80%93%20how%20to%20apply">apply
for an entry visa online.</a> </p>

<h3>Registration and permission to remain</h3>

<p>Non-EEA nationals (with the exception of Switzerland) must <a shape="rect" href="../../../moving_country/moving_to_ireland/rights_of_residence_in_ireland/registration_of_non_eea_nationals_in_ireland.html">register
with the local immigration officer</a> in the area where they intend to live
when they arrive in the State. In Dublin you register at the Burgh Quay
Registration Office. Since 15 September 2016, you must <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/registration-appointment-system">book
an appointment online</a> to visit it. Outside Dublin you may register at your
<a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/registration-offices">regional
registration office</a> or your local <a href="http://www.garda.ie/Stations/Default.aspx">Garda District
Headquarters.</a> </p>

<h3>Dependants </h3>

<p>You may be able to bring your family to live here after you have been
legally working here for a year on a General Employment Permit. You also have
to be able to show that you will be able to support them. In practice, you need
to be earning more than the limits for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
Income Supplement</a>. </p>

<p>If you have a General Employment Permit your spouse, partner or dependants
are not eligible to apply for a <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Permit-Types/Dependant-Partner-Spouse-Employment-Permit/">Dependant/Partner/Spouse
Employment Permit</a>. They can apply for a General Employment Permit in their
own right. They may require visas to come to Ireland (see 'Visas' above) and
there are <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Join%20Family">INIS
guidelines about family reunification for workers.</a></p>

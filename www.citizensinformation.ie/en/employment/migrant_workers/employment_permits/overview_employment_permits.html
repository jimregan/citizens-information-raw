<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Most non-EEA nationals must have an employment permit to work in Ireland.
The employment permits scheme is governed by the <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/en_act_2006_0016.htm">Employment
Permits Acts 2003–2014.</a></p>

<p>Since 1 October 2014, under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0026/index.html">Employment
Permits (Amendment) Act 2014</a> there are <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Permit-Types/">9
types of employment permit.</a> They include a General Employment Permit and a
Critical Skills Employment Permit, which have replaced the work permit and
Green Card permit respectively. New types of employment permit include a
Reactivation Employment Permit for those whose employment permit has expired in
certain circumstances. The Act also provides that a non-EEA national without an
employment permit, who took all reasonable steps to get one, may be allowed to
take civil action against the employer to compensate them for work done or
services rendered.</p>

<p>The 4 main types of employment permit are as follows:</p>

<h3>General Employment Permit</h3>

<p><a href="work_permits.html">General Employment Permits (formerly work
permits)</a> are available for occupations with an annual remuneration of
€30,000 or more. They will only be considered in exceptional cases for jobs
with a lower annual remuneration. Normally, a <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Labour-Market-Needs-Test/">labour
market needs test</a> is required.</p>

<h3>Critical Skills Employment Permit</h3>

<p><a href="green_card_permits.html">Critical Skills Employment Permits
(formerly Green Card permits)</a> are available for most occupations with
annual remuneration of over €60,000. They are also available for occupations
with annual remuneration of at least €30,000 on the <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Highly-Skilled-Eligible-Occupations-List/">Highly
Skilled Occupations List.</a> There is no requirement for a labour market needs
test.</p>

<h3>Dependant/Partner/Spouse Employment Permit</h3>

<p><a href="spousal_work_permit_scheme.html">Dependant/Partner/Spouse
Employment Permits</a> apply to spouses, recognised partners, civil partners
and dependants of holders of Critical Skills Employment Permits or existing
Green Card permits or researchers under a hosting agreement. There is no
requirement for a labour market needs test.</p>

<h3>Reactivation Employment Permit</h3>

<p><a href="reactivation_employment_permit.html">Reactivation Employment
Permits</a> allow foreign nationals who entered the State on a valid employment
permit but who fell out of the system through no fault of their own, or have
been badly treated or exploited in the workplace, to work again. Applicants for
a Reactivation Employment Permit must first apply for a temporary immigration
permission stamp 1 to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS).

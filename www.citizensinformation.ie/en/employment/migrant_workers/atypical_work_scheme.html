<p>The Atypical Working Scheme allows non-EEA nationals to do certain
short-term contract work which is not covered by the Employment Permits Acts.
Under the Scheme, non-EEA nationals, such as locum doctors or those on
short-term contracts for a company, are permitted to work in Ireland.</p>

<p><strong>Non-EEA fishermen:</strong> Since 15 February 2016, <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/atypical-scheme-fishing-crew">certain
non-EEA crew members working in the Irish fishing fleet</a> may apply for the
Atypical Working Scheme.</p>

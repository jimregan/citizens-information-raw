<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are moving to Ireland or considering re-locating here, finding a job
is probably going to be one of your priorities. It is advisable to have
employment and possibly some accommodation organised in advance of your journey
but it is not a requirement. If you are planning to move country, it makes
sense to do some research into the opportunities available here, the average
rates of pay and taxation issues and to ensure there are no restrictions that
would preclude you from working here. </p>

<p><span>The Citizens Information website does not carry any information about
job vacancies for any sector of the Irish economy. It does not accept
CVs/resumes and cannot forward them to employers on your behalf.
</span>Recruitment agencies in Ireland offer a wide range of employment
opportunities - from casual employment to specialised skills - see 'Where to
apply' below.</p>

<p>This document will provide you with information and advice about coming to
work in Ireland and your rights when finding and securing a job as a foreign
national employee in Ireland. </p>

<h3>Qualifications </h3>

<p>Quality and Qualifications Ireland is the Irish centre for the recognition
of international qualifications. It has an <a href="http://qsearch.qqi.ie/WebPart/Search?searchtype=recognitions">International
Qualifications Database</a>. You need to know about how <a href="http://www.qqi.ie/Articles/Pages/Qualifications-Recognition.aspx">qualifications
are recognised in Ireland</a> and about the <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/The-Education-System/Qualifications-Recognition/">mutual
recognition of professional qualifications</a>. If you have a professional
qualification, you should check with the Irish branch of your professional body
as to whether your qualifications are acceptable for use in Ireland - see
'Professions and careers' below.</p>

<h3>EEA nationals</h3>

<p>If you are an <a shape="rect" href="coming_from_eu_to_work.html">EEA or
Swiss national coming to work in Ireland</a>, you are entitled to be treated
like any other applicant when you apply for work. You are free to apply for any
job vacancy, including jobs in the public sector. These include jobs in the <a href="http://www.military.ie/en/home/">Irish army</a> and the Irish police
force (<a shape="rect" href="http://www.garda.ie">An Garda Síochána</a>), but
not the Irish diplomatic service. </p>

<p>Note: the EEA (European Economic Area) comprises the European Union (EU)
member states, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. </p>

<p><strong>European Employment Services (EURES)</strong></p>

<p>Citizens of the EU/EEA are free to live and work in other member states
without restriction. To facilitate the free movement of workers between member
states, the EURES network consisting of the public employment service and the
<a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/european_government/eu_institutions/european_commission.html">European
Commission</a> in each country has been established. EURES aims to: </p>
<ul><li>Provide a European Job Placement Services for jobseekers </li>
  <li>Offer advice and guidance on how to look for a job in the EEA and the
    possibilities that exist for finding work in another country </li>
  <li>Provide a recruitment service to employers who wish to recruit in EEA
    member states </li>
  <li>Provide information on living and working conditions in EEA member states
  </li>
</ul><p>Within each EU/EEA member state, specially trained placement officers
(called <a shape="rect" href="http://ec.europa.eu/eures/main.jsp?catId=3&amp;acro=eures&amp;lang=en">EURES
Advisers)</a> provide free information and advice to workers and employers
about all of the above issues. EEA jobseekers who wish to work in another
member state will obtain <a shape="rect" href="http://ec.europa.eu/eures/home.jsp?lang=en">information on jobs and
information on living/working conditions in the EEA here.</a> If you are
looking for work, you can also post your CV on the EURES website where it can
be accessed by thousands of employers throughout the EEA. This will help
maximise your chances of securing employment. </p>

<h3>Non-EEA nationals</h3>

<p>In general non-EEA nationals <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Who-needs-an-Employment-Permit-/">(apart
from some exceptions)</a> must have a employment permit to work in Ireland.
From 12 October 2007 non-EEA nationals who are carrying out scientific research
for approved research organisations do not need an employment permit.</p>

<p>The arrangements for employment permits include:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="employment_permits/green_card_permits.html">Critical Skills
    Employment Permits</a> which are available for all occupations with an
    annual salary above €60,000 and for a restricted range of occupations
    with an annual salary above €30,000 </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="employment_permits/work_permits.html">General
    Employment Permits</a> which are available mainly for occupations with
    salaries between €30,000 and €60,000 which are not eligible for a
    Critical Skills Employment Permit. The General Employment Permit
    application must meet a labour market test showing that the position could
    not be filled from within the EEA. </li>
</ul><p>Your nearest Irish embassy or consulate will be able to advise on whether
you <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/coming_to_live_in_ireland/visa_requirements_for_entering_ireland.html">require
a travel visa</a> before coming to Ireland. </p>

<h3>Casual work</h3>

<p>These jobs are often advertised in shop windows, in shopping centres,
through daily Irish newspapers and through employment agencies. While many of
these jobs do not require any specific professional qualifications, it is
advisable to bring evidence of any educational standards (such as secondary
school certificates, diplomas, and degrees) you have attained with you to
Ireland. It is also useful to bring an up-to-date résumé/CV in the English
language with you as you may be requested to supply information on any
experience or expertise you may have. </p>

<p>If you are planning to come to Ireland and are seeking casual employment,
you could register with a recruitment agency in advance of your journey. You
should also keep an eye on advertisements for casual workers in shops/stores.
</p>

<h3>Professions and careers</h3>

<p>Finding a career job in Ireland will involve a little more planning than
looking for casual work. While a career job may take a little longer to secure,
you are advised get organised and start applying for jobs before you travel. It
is also useful to bear in mind that these jobs are generally paid at a higher
level than other jobs that do not require any qualifications. Almost all
professions in Ireland have associations or societies in Ireland that represent
and often regulate their members. These associations will provide information
on recognition of professional qualifications, employment opportunities and
careers. <a href="http://www.education.ie/en/The-Education-System/Qualifications-Recognition/Contact-List-Mutual-Recognition-of-Professions.pdf">Almost
all of these organisations have their own websites (pdf)</a>, which you can
search for online using any good search engine. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>All employees, irrespective of their nationality, experience, expertise or
profession, are protected by the law in Ireland. These laws set down specific
rules about <a shape="rect" href="../rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/pay_inc_min_wage.html">minimum
rates of pay</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../rights_and_conditions/hours_of_work/working_week.html">working
hours</a>, <a href="../employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/">leave</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../rights_and_conditions/health_and_safety/health_safety_work.html">health
and safety</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../starting_work_and_changing_job/changing_job/">changing jobs</a> and <a href="../employment_rights_and_conditions/">employment rights</a>. </p>

<p>For commercial reasons, <span>it is not possible for the Citizens
Information website to carry information about actual job vacancies, specific
employment opportunities or information on careers in Ireland</span>.
<strong>The Citizens Information website <span>cannot accept résumés/CVs or
provide information on specific career paths.</span> </strong></p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>If you are applying for a job in Ireland through a recruitment agency, it's
worth bearing in mind that it is <span>very unusual</span> that you are charged
for these services. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>When you apply for a job you need to have a curriculum vitae (CV) or resumé
in English which is a summary or listing of your qualifications and work
experience. You also should have original copies of your qualifications and
official copies of them in English. If you are in Ireland and you need to have
documents translated into English you can contact the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=376">embassy or consulate of your
country</a> for assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Qualifications recognition:</strong> you can download a <a href="http://qsearch.qqi.ie/WebPart/Search?searchtype=recognitions">comparability
statement for your qualification</a> and a <a href="http://www.qqi.ie/Publications/Publications/Naric%20Ireland%20User%20Guide.pdf">user
guide (pdf)</a> from qqi.ie.</p>

<p>If you are seeking employment in Ireland, the job advertisement or
recruitment agency will advise you how to apply for the job. </p>

<p>If you are a non-EEA national you can find out more information about <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Permit-Types/General-Employment-Permit/">General

Skills Employment Permits</a> on the website of the Department of Jobs,
Enterprise and Innovation.</p>

<p>If you need a visa you must <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Apply%20for%20a%20visa%20%E2%80%93%20how%20to%20apply">apply
online for an Irish visa</a>. </p>

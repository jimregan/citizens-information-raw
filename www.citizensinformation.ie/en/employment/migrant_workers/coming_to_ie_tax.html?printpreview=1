<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Your liability for tax in Ireland can be affected by whether you are
resident in the country and whether Ireland is your permanent home. There is a
specific definition of residence for tax purposes depending on how many days
you spend in the country. If you are not resident in a particular year, you can
still be ordinarily resident in Ireland since this term refers to the country
where you are usually resident over a number of years. The country that is your
permanent home is known as your domicile. You can find more information in our
document about <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/moving_country_and_taxation/tax_residence_and_domicile_in_ireland.html">tax
residence and domicile</a>.</p>

<p>Generally you will be charged Irish tax on your world-wide income earned or
arising in a tax year during which you are resident, ordinarily resident and
domiciled in Ireland for tax purposes.</p>

<p>For any tax year during which you are non-resident and not ordinarily
resident in Ireland you will be charged tax on your income from Irish sources
only. The extent of your liability to Irish tax may also be influenced by your
domicile status and possibly by a double taxation agreement - see below.</p>

<p>In addition to income tax and the <a href="../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">Universal
Social Charge</a>, social insurance, known in Ireland as PRSI (Pay-Related
Social Insurance), is also deducted through the tax system by employers – see
‘Social insurance’ below. Self-employed people pay them directly to
Revenue. You can find more information about this in the Revenue <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/personal/circumstances/moving/index.html">guide
for those transferring residence to Ireland</a>. </p>

<p></p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="la851e">Residence status</h2>

<p>You will be resident in Ireland for a particular tax year if:</p>
<ul><li>If you spend 183 days or more in Ireland for any purpose in that tax year
  </li>
  <li>If you spend 280 days or more in Ireland for any purpose over a period of
    2 consecutive tax years you will be regarded as resident in Ireland for the
    second tax year. However if you spend 30 days or less in total in Ireland
    in either tax years, those days will not be reckoned for the purpose of
    applying this test </li>
</ul><p>It does not matter if you come and go several times during that tax year or
if you are here continuously. A count is made of the total number of days you
spend in Ireland for any purpose in each tax year. An individual is present for
a ‘day’ for residence purposes if he or she is present in the State at any
time during the day.</p>

<h3>Effect of ownership of property</h3>

<p>The ownership of property in Ireland will not make you resident for Irish
tax purposes. However, this factor could be relevant in determining a single
country of residence under a double taxation agreement where the other treaty
country is also claiming that you are resident there.</p>

<h3>Electing to be resident</h3>

<p>Even if you have not spent the required total number of days in Ireland, you
can, if you wish, elect to be resident for that tax year. A condition of making
an election is that you must establish to the satisfaction of your local tax
office that you will be resident here in the following tax year for the
required number of days, under either of the tests. Once you have made such an
election you cannot cancel it subsequently. As a resident you will be liable to
tax on your world-wide income earned or arising during the entire tax year of
your arrival in Ireland. Employment income however will be taxable only from
the date of your arrival. An election may be made in writing to your <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/contact/index.html">local tax office.</a></p>

<h3>Ordinary residence</h3>

<p>If you have been resident for the previous 3 tax years then you become
ordinarily resident from the start of the fourth year. If you leave the
country, you will continue to be ordinarily resident until you have been
non-resident for 3 continuous tax years.</p>

<h3>Domicile</h3>

<p>Your domicile is the country where you live with the intention of remaining
there permanently. It may be different to your residence or nationality. When
you are born, you have a domicile of origin. This domicile can be changed to a
domicile of choice, if you move to a different country with the intention of
living there permanently.</p>

<p><strong>Domicile levy:</strong> Since 2010 there is a Irish domicile levy.
You can get more information about the <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/domicile-levy/index.html">domicile levy from
Revenue.</a></p>

<p></p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l01933">Taxation</h2>

<h3>Double taxation agreement</h3>

<p>As a particular item of income can be taxable in both the country where it
is sourced and also in the country in which you, as the recipient, are
resident, Ireland has a number of double taxation agreements with other
countries in order to avoid double taxation. There is a <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/practitioner/law/double/double-taxation-agreements.html">list
of the double taxation agreements that are in effect</a> on revenue.ie.</p>

<p>If your income is taxable in Ireland and in a country with which Ireland has
a double taxation agreement, you do not pay tax in both countries on the same
income by either:</p>
<ul><li>Exempting the income from tax in one of the countries, or </li>
  <li>Allowing credit in one country for the tax paid in the other country on
    the same income. </li>
</ul><p>The precise treatment of your income will depend on the details of the
particular agreement, the nature and source of your income and, in some cases,
on your nationality or citizenship.</p>

<p>If the income arises in a country with which Ireland does not have an
agreement, the amount of tax paid in Ireland will be based on the net amount
received by you after the deduction of the foreign tax paid. There is no credit
available for foreign tax paid against your Irish tax liability on the same
income.</p>

<h3>Income earned prior to moving to Ireland</h3>

<p>If you are moving to Ireland for the first time or you are an Irish citizen
returning to live in Ireland and you were not resident or ordinarily resident
when the income was earned, the position will be as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Funds accumulated from income earned prior to the beginning of the tax
    year in the year that you become resident in Ireland will not be liable to
    income tax. </li>
  <li>However, income other than employment income arising between the
    beginning of the tax year and the date of your arrival will be taxable if
    brought into Ireland, unless a double taxation agreement provides for a
    different treatment. </li>
</ul><h3>If you are working in Ireland but are paid from abroad</h3>

<p>Unless your income is not liable to Irish tax under the provisions of a
double taxation agreement, it will be taxable here from the date of your
arrival regardless of your Irish residence status for tax purposes. However, if
you are an Irish citizen who is not ordinarily resident or you are not Irish
domiciled, your foreign employment income (excluding UK sourced income) will
only be taxable to the extent that it is remitted into Ireland. If you are
resident for Irish tax purposes in the year that the income is earned, you will
be entitled to full personal tax credits and reliefs.</p>

<h3>Temporary employment in Ireland</h3>

<p>If you are coming to Ireland to take up temporary employment and will not
become resident for Irish tax purposes, proportionate credits and reliefs are
available to non-resident Irish citizens and to citizens, subjects or nationals
of another EU member state. This also applies to residents or nationals of a
country with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement which provides for
such allowances. The proportion of allowances is determined by reference to
your income for the tax year which is subject to Irish tax over your income
from all sources. However, residents of another member state of the European
Union are entitled to full personal tax credits and reliefs in respect of any
tax year that 75% or more of their world-wide income is taxable in Ireland. </p>

<p>Pensions and other assets are normally taxable apart from some exceptions,
for example, some UK pensions.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l8810f">Social insurance </h2>

<p>Your employer will also deduct social insurance contributions, which are
referred to as PRSI (Pay Related Social Insurance), from your pay. They will
help you to qualify for contributory social welfare payments such as <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker's
Benefit</a>, <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">Illness
Benefit</a> and <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html">State
Pension (Contributory).</a> The amount of your contribution will depend on your
category as an employee. For example, most employees pay Class A contributions,
the precise rate depending on your earnings. You can read more about <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/introduction_to_the_irish_system/moving_to_ireland_and_your_social_security_entitlements.html">moving

overview of the social security system in Ireland</a>. </p>

<h3>Personal Public Service Number</h3>

<p>In order to work, you require a <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">Personal
Public Service Number (PPS number)</a>. You can obtain a PPS number (or ask for
your old number, if any, to be traced) at your local social welfare office or
Intreo centre. If you are a foreign national, you will need your passport or
your GNIB certificate of registration and supporting documentation such as
household bills. </p>

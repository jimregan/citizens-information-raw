<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you have come to work in Ireland and you lose your job, it can be a very
difficult situation. If you are not an Irish citizen you need to find out your
rights and entitlements in relation to redundancy, looking for work, social
welfare and getting a tax refund. </p>

<p>If you are an EEA or Swiss national, you can stay in Ireland if you are
unemployed and <a shape="rect" href="../starting_work_and_changing_job/training_and_looking_for_work/finding_and_getting_a_job.html">looking
for work</a>. The EEA or European Economic Area consists of the 28 EU member
states, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. If you are a non-EEA national who
has an employment permit there are special arrangements for employment permit
holders who are made redundant – see ‘Employment permits’ below. </p>

<h3>Employment permits</h3>

<p>If you are a non-EEA national with an <a href="employment_permits/overview_employment_permits.html">employment
permit</a>, there are special conditions that apply to employment permit
holders <a href="https://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Redundancy/">who
have been made redundant</a> within the last 6 months. You should notify the
Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation within 28 days of your dismissal.
</p>

<p>If you have been made redundant after working on a work permit for 5
consecutive years <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Policy%20for%205%20year%20workers%20and%20redundant%20workers">you
will no longer need a permit to work in Ireland.</a></p>

<p>If you entered the State on a valid employment permit but you fell out of
the system through no fault of your own, or you have been badly treated or
exploited in the workplace, you may be eligible for a <a href="employment_permits/reactivation_employment_permit.html">Reactivation
Employment Permit.</a></p>

<h3>Redundancy</h3>

<p>If you are dismissed by your employer you should check if it is a <a shape="rect" href="../unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/overview_redundancy.html">redundancy
situation,</a> for example, the closure of a business. If it is not a genuine
redundancy or if you think you have been unfairly selected for redundancy, you
may qualify to bring a claim for <a shape="rect" href="../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfair
dismissal.</a> Your employer must prove that there was a genuine redundancy
situation and that <a shape="rect" href="../unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/redundancy_procedures.html">fair
procedures were followed.</a> </p>

<p>If it is a genuine redundancy situation, you may be entitled to a <a shape="rect" href="../unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/redundancy_payments.html">redundancy
payment</a> if you have been working for your employer for 2 or more years. You
may have <a shape="rect" href="../unemployment_and_redundancy/losing_your_job/losing_job_entitlements.html">other
entitlements such as notice and holiday pay</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lb3662">Social welfare payments</h2>

<p><strong>Jobseeker's Benefit: </strong>You may be entitled to <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker’s
Benefit(JB)</a> when you lose your job or are made redundant. To get JB you
must be unemployed and looking for work and you must have paid a certain number
of social insurance (PRSI) contributions. <strong>EEA migrant workers</strong>
may <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/social_insurance_contributions_from_abroad.html">combine
their social insurance contributions paid in another EU country</a> to help
them qualify for JB. <strong>Non-EEA migrant workers </strong>who qualify for
JB can get it as long as they are legally resident in Ireland. </p>

<p><strong>Jobseeker's Allowance:</strong> If you are not entitled to
Jobseeker’s Benefit, you can apply for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s
Allowance (JA)</a>. Jobseeker’s Allowance is a means-tested payment. To get
JA you must be unemployed, looking for work and pass a means test. You must
also be <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitually
resident</a> to get JA.</p>

<p><strong>EEA migrant workers </strong>who do not qualify for Jobseeker's
Benefit, will meet the habitual residence requirement for Supplementary Welfare
Allowance (SWA) if they are actively looking for work. If they have been
working in Ireland for less than 12 months, they are entitled to get SWA for 6
months from the date their employment ended. If they have been employed for
more than 12 months they are entitled get SWA as long as they are actively
looking for work.</p>

<p><strong>Rent Supplement:</strong> If you are getting JB, JA or SWA and
paying rent to a private landlord, you may be entitled to <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a>. However, to get Rent Supplement you must pass a means test and
be habitually resident in Ireland.</p>

<p><strong>Non-EEA students</strong> are not entitled to social welfare
payments in Ireland.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l4b78a">Tax</h2>

<p>You may be entitled to a <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/tax_refund_when_unemployed_or_out_of_work_sick.html">tax
refund</a>, if you have paid tax and you are now unemployed. If you have not
paid any tax, you will not be due a refund.</p>

<p>If you are getting another income which is taxable, for example,
Jobseeker’s Benefit, you should wait for 8 weeks from the date you became
unemployed before applying for a refund.</p>

<p>If you are not getting Jobseeker’s Benefit and have no other taxable
income, you should wait 4 weeks from the date you become unemployed before
applying for a refund.</p>

<p>If emergency tax was being deducted by your former employer you should apply
immediately.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lfedd1">Returning home</h2>

<p>If you have no work and you are not entitled to a social welfare payment you
may find it very difficult to continue living in Ireland, particularly if you
do not have <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/non-eea-permission">permission to
remain</a>. There are a number of organisations in Ireland providing <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/coming_to_live_in_ireland/support_services_for_foreign_nationals.html">supports
for foreign nationals</a> in particular: </p>
<ul><li>The <a href="http://immigrantcouncil.ie/">Immigrant Council of Ireland
    (ICI)</a> – see ‘Where to apply’ below – is an independent,
    national organisation which supports migrants coming to Ireland for
    purposes such as work, study, family reunification, self-employment or to
    visit. ICI provides an information service and a limited legal service to
    immigrants.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.mrci.ie/Information/">Migrant Rights Centre
    (MRC)</a> – see ‘Where to apply’ below – is a national organisation
    which provides support to migrant workers and their families. The MRC
    operates a drop-in centre which provides information, advice and
    assistance.see ‘Where to apply’ below – is a national organisation
    which provides support to migrant workers and their families. The MRC

    assistance. </li>
</ul><p>The following schemes may help you if you decide to leave Ireland to return
to your country of origin: </p>

<h3>Scheme of repatriation<br></h3>

<p>The Reception and Integration Agency works with the Department of Social
Protection to support the repatriation of nationals of the new EU member
states. The scheme applies to people who have failed the habitual residency
condition attaching to social assistance payments. Any citizen of a former EU
accession state, and certain other ‘special-case’ EU nationals, who find
themselves destitute during their time in Ireland can apply for this scheme. If
you wish to apply for this scheme you should contact the Department of Social
Protection's representative (formerly known as the Community Welfare Officer)
at your <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/">local
health centre.</a></p>

<h3>Scheme of voluntary assisted return</h3>

<p>If you are an asylum seeker or an irregular migrant from an non-EEA country
who wishes to return voluntarily to your country of origin but do not have the
means to do so, the <a href="http://iomireland.ie/return/">International
Organisation for Migration (IOM)</a> may be able to assist you to return home
– see ‘Where to apply' below. If you return voluntarily and you have no
outstanding criminal court proceedings, you may apply to re-enter Ireland
legally for the purpose of work, study, etc.</p>

<p>Like all employees, people with disabilities can bring a range of skills,
talents and abilities to the workplace and there is a range of supports to help
them find and keep employment. Some of these are for people with disabilities
who are working – see ‘Employees with disabilities’ below. Other supports
are for people with disabilities who are unemployed – see ‘Looking for
work’ below.</p>

<p><strong>If you develop a disability</strong></p>

<p>If you have a job and become disabled – for example, through an accident
or illness – you may want to return to work at some time. In this situation,
it is important to sit down with your employer and discuss openly your options.
Depending on the nature of your disability and the type of job you have, there
may be no problem with you returning to work. In fact, your disability may have
no impact on the type of job you have or your ability to perform it. However,
your disability may require that your workplace be adapted or you may need
special equipment in order to perform your job. If your disability prevents you
from returning to your previous job, there is a range of options available –
see ‘Looking for work’ below.</p>

<p><strong>If you become more disabled or need further support</strong></p>

<p>In situations where you already have a disability that has altered or is
progressive, you should also sit down with your employer and discuss your
available options and needs. Some of the issues you might discuss may involve
whether or not your existing job requires further adaptation, whether
alterations are required to the premises and whether your working conditions
and work practices will need to change. You should also be frank and realistic
about your own ability to continue to work.</p>

<h3>Options at work</h3>

<p>The onset or progression of a disability can be a devastating event.
However, it does not always mean that you will have to give up your job.
Employers are obliged to make reasonable accommodations for staff with
disabilities and often, you can continue working in an adapted workplace or
with equipment and changes to your work practice and conditions of employment.
Some possible options for you and your employer include:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Partial re-deployment</strong> which allows you to continue to do
    part of your original job (either part-time or with the addition of new
    tasks). You can drop certain tasks and take on others that are currently
    carried out by other colleagues. </li>
  <li><strong>Re-deployment:</strong> If you are unable to perform your
    previous job, but could carry out another function within the organisation,
    re-training and re-deployment are options you and your employer can
    consider. </li>
  <li><strong>Flexible working arrangements:</strong> If you have a disability,
    being able to work part-time, flexitime, job share or work from home may be
    a deciding factor in whether you can resume your working life. </li>
  <li><strong>Adapting the workplace and assistive technology:</strong> an
    accessible workplace and assistive technology can allow you to perform your
    job without difficulty. The <a shape="rect" href="grants_for_adapting_or_equipping_the_workplace_for_disabled_staff.html">Workplace/Equipment
    Adaptation Grant</a> provides funding towards the costs of modifications or
    special equipment that will allow a disabled person to take up an offer of
    employment or to remain in employment. </li>
  <li><strong>Personal Reader Grant:</strong> If you are blind or visually
    impaired and you need help with job-related reading, you may be entitled to
    a <a shape="rect" href="personal_reader_grants_for_blind_or_visually_impaired_employees.html">grant
    to allow you to employ a personal reader</a>. </li>
</ul><h3>Supports for employers </h3>

<p>Finding and keeping capable, experienced staff that you can rely on is
important to all employers. There are a number of support schemes available to
you if a member of your staff acquires a disability or if you hire a new staff
member who has a disability. These employment supports are provided by the
Department of Social Protection.</p>
<ul><li><strong><a shape="rect" href="grants_for_adapting_or_equipping_the_workplace_for_disabled_staff.html">Workplace/Equipment
    Adaptation Scheme:</a></strong> If you have to make changes, you may be
    able to get this grant towards the costs of adapting your premises or
    buying equipment. <strong></strong></li>
  <li>The <strong><a shape="rect" href="grants_for_employers_to_retain_employees_with_disabilities.html">Employee
    Retention Grant Scheme</a></strong> can help you to retain an employee who
    has acquired an illness, condition or impairment that affects their ability
    to carry out their job. </li>
  <li>The <strong><a shape="rect" href="training_grants_for_disability_awareness_in_employment.html">Disability
    Awareness Training Scheme</a></strong> is open to all companies in the
    private sector. Disability awareness training can help your staff provide
    the best service to customers or clients with disabilities and ensures that
    they also develop and maintain good working relationships with colleagues
    with disabilities. </li>
  <li>The <strong><a shape="rect" href="grant_aid_scheme_for_employers_with_disabled_staff.html">Wage Subsidy
    Scheme</a></strong> provides financial incentives to employers, outside the
    public sector, to employ certain people with disabilities who work between
    21 and 39 hours per week. </li>
</ul><p>The <a href="https://www.djei.ie/en/News-And-Events/Department-News/2016/February/02022016a.html">Employers'
Disability Information Service</a> is for employers on employing staff with
disabilities. Its information and advice is available through the telephone
helpline on (01) 676 2014 and the website, <a href="http://www.employerdisabilityinfo.ie/">employerdisabilityinfo.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>Employment rights of people with disabilities</h3>

<p>Employees with disabilities have the same <a href="../employment_rights_and_conditions/">employment rights</a> as other
employees. </p>

<p><strong>Equality legislation:</strong> The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0021/index.html">Employment
Equality Acts 1998-2015</a> outlaw discrimination on the grounds of disability
in employment, including training and recruitment. However the Employment
Equality Acts state that an employer is not obliged to recruit or retain a
person who is not fully competent or capable of undertaking the duties attached
to a job. If you have a mental health difficulty there are 2 booklets, <a href="http://www.ihrec.ie/publications/list/equality-and-mental-health-what-the-law-means-fo/">Equality
and mental health: what the law means for your workplace</a> and <a href="https://www.ihrec.ie/documents/equality-and-mental-health-how-the-law-can-help/">Equality
and mental health: how the law can help you.</a></p>

<p><strong>Reasonable accommodation:</strong> The Employment Equality Acts
1998-2015 require employers to take reasonable steps to accommodate the needs
of employees and prospective employees with disabilities. Reasonable
accommodation can be defined as some modification to the tasks or structure of
a job or workplace, which allows the qualified employee with a disability to
fully do the job and enjoy equal employment opportunities. However, <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0078:EN:HTML">under
EU legislation, employers are not obliged to provide special treatment or
facilities if the cost of doing so is excessive or disproportionate.</a></p>

<p><strong>Health and safety:</strong> Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2005/act/10/enacted/en/html">Safety,
Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005</a> employers must ensure the <a shape="rect" href="../rights_and_conditions/health_and_safety/health_safety_work.html">safety,
health and welfare of all employees</a> in their workplace. Special mention is
made of employees with disabilities and employers are directed to take their
needs into account, particularly with regard to doors, passageways, staircases,
showers, washbasins, lavatories and workstations.</p>

<p><strong>Public service quota:</strong> The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0014/index.html">Disability
Act 2005</a> places an obligation on public bodies to consider and respond to
the needs of people with disabilities. Under Part 5 of the Act, 3% of jobs in
public service bodies (local authorities, civil service, the Health Service
Executive and so on) are reserved for people with disabilities.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l4a2ce">Looking for work</h2>

<p>Whether you are looking for a job for the first time or re-entering the work
force after an absence, it is important that you take stock of your skills and
the practicalities associated with both your disability and the kind of work
for which you are applying. A lot of employers have equal opportunities
policies in place and make it clear on job applications that they welcome
applications from suitably qualified people with disabilities. However, you
should be aware of your rights and the obligations potential employers have
towards you under equality legislation. It is up to you to decide whether to
disclose your disability to potential employers. This is particularly so if
your disability is not obvious (such as a chronic illness like arthritis or a
mental illness) but may keep you from performing certain duties. While you may
have your reasons for keeping your disability private, your employer cannot
accommodate any special needs you may have if they do not know about your
condition.</p>

<p>There are a number of support schemes and training opportunities available
to people with disabilities who want to enter the work force.</p>

<h3>Supports and training</h3>

<p>Labour market services for people with disabilities include helping them
find paid employment or preparing them for work through training or employment
programmes. Employment supports are provided by the Department of Social
Protection.</p>

<p>There is <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/vocational_education_and_training/fas_training_programmes_and_supports/fas_training_courses.html">training
for the unemployed</a> and for people who are re-entering the workforce through
specific skills training and traineeships. Training for people in employment is
offered through apprenticeships and in-company training. People with
disabilities are encouraged to make use of all these training options. </p>

<p>Training courses for people with disabilities who may need more intensive
support than would be available in non-specialist training courses are
delivered by specialist training providers. Some key features of specialist
training include adapted equipment, a more individual approach and longer
training sessions.</p>

<p><strong>Job Interview Interpreter Grant Scheme</strong></p>

<p>If you are a jobseeker who is deaf, hard of hearing or has a speech
impairment you can apply for funding to have a <a shape="rect" href="job_interview_interpreter_grant_scheme.html">sign language interpreter or
other interpreter attend a job interview with you</a>. Funding can also be
provided to cover the costs of an interpreter during an induction period when
you start work. </p>

<p><strong>EmployAbility Service</strong> </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="supported_employment_for_people_with_disabilities.html">EmployAbility
Service</a> helps people with disabilities find work and offers them ongoing
support, including job coaches throughout their employment. The programme
operates through a range of organisations around the country. </p>

<h3>Disability payments and work</h3>

<p>If you are getting certain disability payments, for example, <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability
Allowance</a> and <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/blind_persons_pension.html">Blind

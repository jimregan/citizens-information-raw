<p>Grant assistance is available for employers, employees and self-employed
disabled people who need to adapt the workplace or purchase specialised
equipment for staff with disabilities. This grant is called the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Workplace-Equipment-Adaptation-Grant.aspx">Workplace
Equipment/Adaptation Grant (WEAG)</a> and you can apply for the grant if the
disabled person is already employed or is about to be employed by you.
Alternatively, if you have a disability, you can apply for the grant yourself
if you are already in employment or about to commence employment or
self-employment. </p>

<p>Public sector employers (for example, government departments, State
agencies, the <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/how_health_is_organised/health_boards.html">Health Service
Executive</a>, local authorities) are obliged to facilitate the needs of their
staff with disabilities. This means making assistive technology, adaptive
equipment and facilities, aids and appliances available<span>. Public sector
employers and their employees with disabilities are therefore not entitled to
claim this grant.</span> (Public sector employers are required to make these
services available from their own resources). </p>

<p>Examples of adaptations for which a grant may be given include: </p>
<ul><li>Voice synthesisers for computers or amplifiers for telephones </li>
  <li>Alarm systems with flashing lights </li>
  <li>Minor building modifications (ramps or modified toilets) </li>
  <li>Stair lifts. </li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>A wide range of equipment and adaptations are covered by this grant. You
should be aware, however, that you are not entitled to make an application for
grant assistance each year. </p>

<p>You also cannot make an application for equipment that was purchased
retrospectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The maximum amount of grant aid is €6,350 towards the cost of adapting or
purchasing equipment. This grant can also be used to upgrade adapted equipment
that was funded previously. </p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You or your employer can apply for the grant if you are already employed or
about to commence employment. You must complete <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/WEAGApplicationPart1.pdf">Part 1 (pdf)</a>
and <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/WEAGApplicationPart2.pdf">Part 2
(pdf)</a> of the Reasonable Accommodation Fund application form which is
available online. It is also available from your <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Employment-Services-Offices.aspx">local
employment services office</a> or <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Intreo---Contact-Information.aspx">Intreo
centre</a>.</p>

<p>You should identify the equipment and/or adaptation required, justifying why
it is needed and supply quotations. If the equipment or adaptation costs over
€700, you are required to obtain 2 price quotations from different suppliers.
If the equipment or adaptation costs over €1,500, then you are required to
obtain 3 price quotations from different suppliers. </p>

<p>When your completed application form and quotations are received, your
application will be reviewed. The equipment or adaptation that is selected will
be the most appropriate for you (and may not necessarily be the lowest quote).
The grant is then paid directly to the applicant to cover the agreed costs. </p>

<p>If you are a public sector employee and require or will require adaptive or
assistive technology or changes to your workplace, you should get in touch
directly with the Disability Liaison Officer in your Human Resources Unit. </p>

<p>Completed applications for a workplace equipment or adaptation grant should
be sent to your <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Employment-Services-Offices.aspx">local
employment services office</a> or <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Intreo---Contact-Information.aspx">Intreo
centre</a>. A copy of the receipt for the item or adaptation should also be
enclosed with your application. </p>

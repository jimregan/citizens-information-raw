<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you have a disability and wish to take up paid employment or you require
assistance in finding a job, the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Work-Supports-for-People-with-a-Disability_holder.aspx">EmployAbility
Service</a> (formerly the Supported Employment Service) may be able to help
you. It provides people with disabilities with supports to help them access
employment. The supports are provided by sponsor organisations on behalf of the
Department of Social Protection – see ‘Sponsor organisations’ below.</p>

<h3>EmployAbility Service</h3>

<p>This is an employment and recruitment service to assist people, who have a
range of disabilities and impairments, to obtain and keep a job. The Service
provides a number of 'on-the-job' supports, such as a Job Coach who will assist
both the employer and the person seeking employment. In order to avail of the
EmployAbility Service, you must genuinely require the initial support of a Job
Coach to obtain employment in the open market – see ‘Job Coach’ below.</p>

<p>The range of supports provided by the Service include:</p>
<ul><li>Individual needs assessment</li>
  <li>Vocational profiling and career planning</li>
  <li>Individual employment plan</li>
  <li>Job sourcing and job matching</li>
  <li>On-the-job support and coaching</li>
  <li>Advice and support to employers</li>
  <li>Follow-up support and mentoring to both employers and employees</li>
</ul><h3>Jobseekers</h3>

<p>The Service provides jobseekers with career advice and employment support.
Career advice includes identification of skills and assistance with searching
for jobs. Employment support is provided when accessing vacancies and applying
for jobs. It also includes matching skills with the employers’ needs, work
experience placements, finding employers and assistance with integrating into
the workplace. The Service provides access to support services when required to
maintain employment and advice on employment benefits and entitlements.</p>

<h3>Employers</h3>

<p>The EmployAbility Service’s supports for employers include:</p>
<ul><li>Free recruitment and employment service</li>
  <li>Database of skilled jobseekers</li>
  <li>Access to a committed, local work force</li>
  <li>On-going support from a professional team of Job Coaches</li>
  <li>Advice on employment grants and supports – see below</li>
</ul><h3>Employment grants and supports</h3>

<p>The Department of Social Protection funds a range of employment supports
aimed at helping employees with a disability to gain and retain employment.
Under the Reasonable Accommodation Fund there is the <a href="job_interview_interpreter_grant_scheme.html">Job Interview Interpreter
Grant</a>, the <a href="personal_reader_grants_for_blind_or_visually_impaired_employees.html">Personal
Reader Grant</a>, the <a href="grants_for_employers_to_retain_employees_with_disabilities.html">Employee
Retention Grant Scheme</a> and the <a href="grants_for_adapting_or_equipping_the_workplace_for_disabled_staff.html">Workplace
Equipment/Adaptation Grant</a>. Other supports for employers include the <a href="grant_aid_scheme_for_employers_with_disabled_staff.html">Wage Subsidy
Scheme</a> and the <a href="training_grants_for_disability_awareness_in_employment.html">Disability
Awareness Training Support Scheme</a>.</p>

<h3>Job Coach</h3>

<p>Job Coaches offer on-the-job assistance and provide ongoing support to
participants before, during and after employment. </p>

<p>If you have a disability, a Job Coach can help you by: </p>
<ul><li>Assisting you in identifying your skills, interests and aspirations. This
    involves sitting down with you and going through a vocational profile of
    your skills and interests. </li>
  <li>Helping you to identifying suitable employment where your skills,
    interests and talents match the requirements of the job. </li>
  <li>Examining the various tasks involved in the job and planning the various
    supports you will need. </li>
  <li>Helping you to develop the technical and social skills required to do the
    job. </li>
</ul><h3>Securing employment </h3>

<p>When you and your Job Coach have identified and agreed the type of work you
are interested in securing, the next stage is to apply for work. This can be
done by either applying for jobs appropriate to your skills and interests that
are advertised in the normal way or by your Job Coach helping you to identify
and apply for jobs in your area. Sometimes, this can involve your Job Coach
contacting employers in your area or in your chosen field of work. </p>

<p>Job Coaches provide ongoing support to participants in a number of ways. For
some participants (depending on need), the Job Coach can assist with training
on-the-job and provide support in the immediate aftermath of employment,
liasing with the person and his or her employer. For other participants, the
Job Coach can provide support and advice when they need it. </p>

<p>During a placement the Job Coach provides information, advice and ongoing
support to employers. Occasionally, the employer and employee may agree that
the employment is not working out. If this happens, the Job Coach can then step
in and re-assess the situation with regard to further supports and
assistance.</p>

<h3>Sponsor organisations</h3>

<p>The EmployAbility Service operates through sponsor organisations. Often
these are local community and voluntary organisations that provide direct
services to people with disabilities. The sponsor employs Job Coaches to
provide a range of supports to meet the needs of the individual jobseeker with
a disability.</p>

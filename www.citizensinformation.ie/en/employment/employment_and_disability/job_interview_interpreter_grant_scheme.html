<p>If you are attending a job interview and you are deaf or hard of hearing or
have a speech impairment, you may benefit from having the services of an
interpreter at the interview. The Job Interview Interpreter Grant allows anyone
who is deaf, hard of hearing or has a significant speech impairment to have a
professional interpreter provide services for him/her at a job interview. If
you have just started work, you may also get this grant to cover the costs of
an interpreter during an induction period. The grant is provided under the
Department of Social Protectionâ€™s Reasonable Accommodation Fund.</p>

<p>People who are deaf or hard of hearing communicate in a variety of ways,
depending on a number of factors. Examples of these factors include: the amount
of residual hearing, the type of hearing impairment, language skills, the age
when the impairment began, speech abilities, speech-reading skills,
personality, intelligence, family environment, and educational background. </p>

<p>In an interview setting, the use of an interpreter can help you express your
thoughts clearly and concisely. Interpreters who are used during job interviews
are not permitted to participate in the conversation and they view all
information exchanged as confidential. Nothing is added or deleted from any
interaction between you and the interview board that takes place. </p>

<p>This document describes the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Job-Interview-Interpreter-Grant.aspx">Job
Interview Interpreter Grant</a> and provides some general guidelines for
employers and employees before and during the interview. </p>

<h3>Advice for employees at the interview</h3>

<p>It is advisable to arrange interpreter services as far in advance of the
interview date as possible. This will allow you both to make contact and
discuss any specific requirements (for example, a presentation) that may be a
requirement of the interview process. </p>

<p>Ensure that your interpreter has a copy of your curriculum vitae (CV) in
advance of the interview and that you are both familiar and comfortable with
any specific terminology or vocabulary that may be used during the discussion.
</p>

<p>Contact the employer in advance of the interview to let him/her know the
name of your interpreter and finalise all arrangements. </p>

<h3>Advice for employers at the interview:</h3>

<p>Interpreters have to be able to translate in both directions on the spot.
There are two types of interpreting: consecutive and simultaneous. </p>

<p>During consecutive interpreting, the speaker should stop every 1-5 minutes
(usually at the end of every "paragraph" or a complete thought) and the
interpreter then renders what was said in the target language (for example,
speech or sign language). </p>

<p>During simultaneous interpreting, the interpreter will begin to translate a
few seconds after the speaker commences speaking. The type of interpreting used
during the interview will depend on a number of issues (for example, the
complexity of the subject matter being discussed). Consecutive interpreting is
more often used during interviews and in question-and-answer sessions, but a
mix of consecutive and simultaneous may be used (depending on appropriateness).
</p>

<p>You should speak directly to the person who is deaf or is hard of hearing
(the interviewee), <span>not the interpreter</span>. You should maintain eye
contact with the interviewee to convey a feeling of direct communication. </p>

<p>The interpreter should stand or sit near the speaker, while the person with
the hearing impairment should be near the interpreter and have a clear view. If
the interviewer plans on moving around the area or if there will be multiple
interviewers, the interviewee should ask the interpreter and interviewer before
the interview where the best seating will be. </p>

<p>The interpreter should stand or sit near the speaker, while the person who
is deaf or hard of hearing should be near the interpreter and have a clear
view. If the interviewer plans on moving around the area or if there will be
multiple interviewers, the interviewee should ask the interpreter and
interviewer before the interview where the best seating will be. </p>

<p>Remember that the interpreter is a few words behind the speaker. Give enough
time to finish before you continue so that the person who is deaf or hard of
hearing can ask questions or join in the discussion. </p>

<p>The interpreter or the person who is deaf or hard of hearing may ask you to
slow down or repeat a word or sentence for clarification. Likewise, be sure to
ask for something to be repeated if it is unclear. </p>

<p>You should never ever ask the interpreter to "tell him/her..." as this is
considered disrespectful and rude. </p>

<p>When speaking to someone who is deaf or hard of hearing or has a speech
impairment, you should speak normally. Speaking loudly does not help,
especially if there is an interpreter present. Remember to always speak
directly to (and face) the interviewee - not the interpreter. </p>

<p>Allow the interviewee to complete his/her sentences. It is important to
remember that people with language or speech impairments often have different
speech patterns so you will need to listen attentively. If you do not
understand what was said, ask questions and repeat them to make sure you are
clear. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you are attending the interview, you will need to source and select the
interpreter that will accompany you to the interview. While the interpreter can
be a friend, colleague or family member, it is advised that you seek a
professionally qualified interpreter. </p>

<p>If you will be attending more than one interview, you can apply to have an
interpreter present for each interview. The number of interviews at which you
can attend with an interpreter is unlimited. </p>

<p>If you are unable to source an interpreter, you can request interpretation
services through the Sign Language Interpreting Service - see 'Where to apply'
below. </p>

<h3>Public sector employees</h3>

<p>Public sector employers (government departments, State agencies, Local
Health Offices, local authorities, etc.) are obliged to facilitate the needs of
their staff with disabilties. This means making assistive technology, adaptive
equipment and facilities, aids, appliances and services available to their
employees with disabilities. </p>

<p>If you are already a public sector employee and will be attending an
interview within the public sector, you should be aware that public sector
employers are obliged to ensure interpretation services are made available to
you if you request them. You are therefore not entitled to claim the Job
Interview Interpreter Grant.</p>

<p>If you are attending an interview or a number of interviews to become an
employee in the public sector, you are entitled to apply for the Job Interview
Interpreter Grant. You should be aware, however, that in advance of your
interview, you will most likely be contacted by your prospective public sector
employer and asked if you have any special needs. At this stage, you can
request that interpreter services be made available to you or you can apply for
the grant and arrange your own interpreter. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The Department of Social Protection will pay a fee as per the standard rate
for a 3-hour period using a professionally qualified interpreter. Travel costs
for the interpreter are paid at a set rate. Interpreter rates may vary. Rates
will be differentiated between professionally qualified interpreters and
others. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you are attending a job interview, you should contact your local
employment services office to obtain <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/JobInterviewInterpreterApplicationPart1.pdf">Part
1 (pdf)</a> and <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/JobInterviewInterpreterApplicationPart2.pdf">Part
2 (pdf)</a> of the Reasonable Accommodation Fund application form, which is
also available online. Complete the application form (if you have any
difficulties in completing the application form, the staff in your local
employment services office will help you). </p>

<p>Bring your application form to the interview where it will be signed and
stamped by the employer and your interpreter. When you return the signed and
stamped application form to your local employment services office, the payment
will be made directly to the interpreter.</p>

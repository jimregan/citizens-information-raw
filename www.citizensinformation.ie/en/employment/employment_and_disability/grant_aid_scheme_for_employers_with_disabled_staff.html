<p>The <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Wage-Subsidy-Scheme_holder_3176.aspx">Wage
Subsidy Scheme</a> offers financial support for employers who employ certain
people with disabilities on a full-time basis (between 21 hours and 39 hours
per week). The scheme is one of the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Workplace-Supports_holder.aspx">workplace
supports for employers</a> provided by the Department of Social Protection to
encourage the employment of people with disabilities. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Disability and productivity </h3>

<p>Sometimes the nature of a disability can restrict an employee's productivity
in comparison with other staff, irrespective of their ability to do a job. In
situations where this restriction results in a loss of productivity for the
employer, the Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) allows the employer make up the
shortfall through grant assistance. </p>

<p>It is illegal to discriminate against any employee on the basis of
disability and this right is set down in <a href="../equality_in_work/equality_in_the_workplace.html">employment
equality</a> legislation. </p>

<p>However, it is permitted to discriminate on the grounds of disability where
it can be shown that "there is clear actuarial or other evidence that
significantly increased costs would result, if the discrimination were not
permitted." For this reason, employers that employ staff with disabilities with
proven productivity rates of 50-80% will not lose out if they employ staff with
disabilities as the grant aid under this scheme will make up any shortfall in
reduced productivity. </p>

<p>The scheme provides for 12-monthly reviews by the Department of Social
Protection. An employer must also complete a productivity assessment form to
certify the employee’s productivity deficit. The Department reserves the
right to conduct additional monitoring visits without notice to the
employer’s premises, when and where required.</p>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<p>The Scheme is available to <strong>private sector</strong> employers in the
State who provide a minimum of 21 hours and up to a maximum of 39 hours of
employment per week to workers with a disability.</p>

<p>The scheme is not available to:</p>
<ul><li>Self-employed people</li>
  <li>Participants on Community Employment schemes, or</li>
  <li>Employers who avail of the JobPlus Scheme</li>
</ul><p>If you are receiving one of the following disability payments you can
qualify for the WSS without further medical assessment:</p>
<ul><li><a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability
    Allowance</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/blind_persons_pension.html">Blind
    Pension</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disablement_benefit.html">Disablement
    Pension</a> awarded at 20% or more for life</li>
</ul><p></p>

<p>If you are on Disability Allowance or Blind Pension, you may avail of the
relevant disregard in conjunction with the WSS. You will need to contact the
Disability Allowance or Blind Pension section to tell them that you are
starting work.</p>

<p>You can also qualify if you are getting <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">Illness
Benefit</a> or <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/invalidity_pension.html">Invalidity
Pension</a>. However, you must come off this payment in order to participate in
the WSS.</p>

<p>If you are unemployed, have a disability and are not receiving a disability
payment, you can still apply for the scheme. You will need to provide a recent
specialist’s report or doctor’s letter, confirming your disability. Your
doctor must also complete a confidential Medical Report form confirming that
you have a disability which could cause a shortfall in productivity.</p>

<p>You will also need this medical evidence if you have been awarded a
Disablement Pension or Gratuity assessed at less than 20% for life, or have
been awarded Disablement Benefit on the basis of a provisional assessment.</p>

<h3>Wage Subsidy Scheme strands</h3>

<p></p>

<p>The WSS is divided into 3 strands.</p>

<p><span>Strand 1</span> is a wage subsidy payment paid to the employer to make
up the shortfall if a disabled employee has a productivity level of between 80%
or less (compared to other staff). The employee must work at least 21 hours a
week up to a maximum of 39 hours a week. The rate of subsidy is €5.30 a hour
based on the hours worked. The maximum annual subsidy is €10,748 based on a
39-hour week. </p>

<p><span>Strand 2</span> is a payment to companies that employ more than 2
disabled employees. The "top-up" grant covers supervisory, management and other
work-based costs. The top-up grant is based on the overall number of disabled
employees from an additional 10% of the wage subsidy for 3 to 6 disabled
employees to a maximum of 50% of the wage subsidy for 23+ disabled employees.
</p>

<p><span>Strand 3</span> is a grant to companies that employ 30 or more
disabled employees to enable them to employ an Employment Assistance Officer
(EAO). The EAO is employed to support and assist disabled employees with their
employment needs. The grant is €30,000 per annum. </p>
</div>

<h3>Conditions of employment</h3>

<p>Employees for whom the employer claims grant assistance under this scheme is
subject to the same conditions of employment as all other staff. This means
that these employees qualify for PRSI contributions, <a href="../employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/annual_leave_public_holidays.html">annual
leave</a>, tax deductions, <a href="../employment_rights_and_conditions/contracts_of_employment/contract_of_employment.html">contracts

wage</a> requirements.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The Department of Social Protection, the employer and the employee agree the
wage subsidy to be paid after the first month of employment. Grant assistance
is payable to the employer by electronic fund transfer on a frequency as agreed
with the Department (normally on a monthly basis). The employer pays the going
rate for the job. <strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Employee</strong></p>

<p>Generally, the employee must give up their primary social welfare payment
when they start employment under the Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS). For example, if
you are on Jobseeker’s Allowance, you must stop claiming this payment.
However, new applicants for the scheme who are currently getting Disability
Allowance (DA) or Blind Pension (BP) may apply for the <a href="../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_and_work/disability_payments_and_work.html">DA/BP
rehabilitative work disregard</a> together with the WSS, provided they are
working at least 21 hours a week.</p>

<p></p>
</div>
The WSS is only payable until you become eligible to apply for a State Pension.
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

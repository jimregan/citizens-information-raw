<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">When you become self-employed it means you are carrying on
your own business rather than working for an employer and there are a number of
things to take into consideration. Working for yourself can have a number of
advantages and disadvantages. For example, it means you are in control of what
you do, so you can organise your own hours. On the other hand, it can involve
working very hard and you may no longer have a regular income. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When you start a business you can do so either as a <a href="https://www.cro.ie/Registration/Overview">sole trader, partnership or
limited company.</a> The type of structure you choose depends on the kind of
business you are carrying on, with whom you will be doing business and your
attitude to risk. Here we look at setting up as a sole trader. That is, when
you set up a business on your own. Being a sole trader is relatively
straightforward to set up, but if your business fails, all your assets could be
used to pay your creditors. </p>

<h3>Preparation </h3>

<p>Much of the process of preparing for self-employment is about <a shape="rect" href="setting_up_a_business_in_ireland.html">starting a
business</a>. This is the same information whether you are a sole trader or a
partnership or company. You can read about the organisations, websites and
publications that can help you in our document, <a href="sources_information_on_starting_business.html">Sources of information
on starting a business.</a></p>

<p>If you are a non-EEA national you can find information about starting a
business in our document, <a shape="rect" href="coming_to_set_up_a_business_in_ireland.html">Coming to set up a business
or invest in Ireland.</a> </p>

<h3>Registration of business name </h3>

<p>You may carry on your business using your own name. If you wish to use a
business name you must <a shape="rect" href="https://www.cro.ie/Registration/Business-Name">register your business
name</a> with the Companies Registration Office using Form <a href="https://www.cro.ie/Portals/0/Business%20Names%20Forms/RBN1%20v2%20fillable%202016.pdf">RBN1
(pdf)</a> or <a shape="rect" href="http://www.core.ie/">online using CORE
(Companies Online Registration Environment)</a>. You will then be issued with a
Certificate of Business Name which you must display prominently at your place
of business. There is an information leaflet on <a href="https://www.cro.ie/Portals/0/Leaflets/leaflet_14%20v.6%202016.pdf">registering
a business name (pdf).</a> </p>

<p>You may need to have a business account with your bank. This allows you to
keep your business income separate from your personal income. In general, you
will need your Certificate of Business Name to open a business bank account.

<h3>Tax</h3>

<p>To set up as a sole trader you must <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/running/registering-tax.html#section2">register
for income tax with Revenue as a self-employed sole trader</a>. You do this
using <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/ros/index.html">Revenue’s
online service.</a> Certain people can only register on paper using the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vat/forms/formtr1.pdf">tax
registration form TR1 (pdf)</a> and you can find information about them <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/eregistration/index.html">here.</a> This
form can be also be used to register for VAT. You will receive a “Notice of
Registration” confirming that you are registered for income tax and, if
applicable, for VAT. </p>

<p>As a self-employed individual you pay tax under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it10.html#section2">self-assessment
system</a>. You pay Preliminary Tax (an estimate of tax due) on or before 31
October each year and make a tax return not later than 31 October following the
end of the tax year. You must keep proper records to allow you to fill out your
annual tax return. You pay the <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">Universal
Social Charge</a> directly to Revenue when you make your annual tax return. </p>

<p><strong>Earned Income tax credit:</strong> In 2016, as a self-employed
trader you could claim an <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/about/foi/s16/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-44.pdf">Earned
Income tax credit of €550</a>. In 2017 the Earned Income tax credit increases
to €950 for self-employed taxpayers. However, if you also qualify for the
PAYE tax credit, the combined value of these 2 tax credits cannot exceed
€1,650. </p>

<p>You must keep accounts which record:</p>
<ul><li>All purchases and sales of goods and services and </li>
  <li>All amounts received and all amounts paid out </li>
</ul><p>You must keep supporting records of the above such as invoices, bank and
building society statements and receipts.</p>

<p>You may claim certain business expenses against tax as well as your
contributions to your <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/personal_pensions.html">personal
pension</a>. Further information on tax is available on in our document, <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/taxation_of_self_employed_people.html">Tax
for self-employed people</a>, <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/running/registering-tax.html">from
Revenue</a> and in the Revenue booklet <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it10.html">IT 10 A Guide to Self
Assessment</a>.</p>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it15.html">Start
Up Refunds for Entrepreneurs (SURE)</a> scheme you may be entitled to a refund
of PAYE income tax that you paid over the 6 years before the year in which you
invest in starting a business. </p>

<p>You must <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vat/registration/index.html">register for
Value Added Tax (VAT)</a> if your annual turnover exceeds or is likely to
exceed the following annual limits: €75,000 in respect of the supply of goods
or €37,500 in respect of the supply of services. </p>

<p><strong>Subcontractors:</strong> If you are a self-employed subcontractor
working in construction, forestry or meat processing there is <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/rct/subcontractor.html">detailed information
about Relevant Contracts Tax</a> on the Revenue website. </p>

<h3>PRSI</h3>

<p>If you are self-employed you pay <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/class_S_prsi.html">Class
S PRSI contributions</a>. This entitles you to a limited range of social
insurance payments. Class S PRSI contributions are paid at a rate of 4% on all
income or €500 whichever is the greater. If you earn less than €5,000 from
self-employment in a year you are exempt from paying Class S PRSI but you may
pay €500 as a <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/voluntarysocialinsurancecontributions.html">voluntary
contributor</a>. </p>

<p>When you register with Revenue you are automatically registered for Class S
PRSI. For information on PRSI for the self-employed you can contact your <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/List-of-Social-Welfare-Local-and-Branch-Offices-by-County.aspx">Intreo
centre or social welfare office</a> or the Self-Employment Section of the
Department of Social Protection – see 'Where to apply' below.</p>

<p>The Department of Social Protection has published a leaflet <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Publications/SW74/Pages/1WhatbenefitsmayIgetbypayingClassSPRSI.aspx">PRSI
for the Self-Employed.</a></p>

<p><strong>Family members and PRSI</strong></p>

<p>If a self-employed <strong>sole trader</strong> either employs, or is helped
in the running of the business by specified family member(s), this is known as
<em>family employment</em> and these family members are not covered by the
social insurance system. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Family-Employments-that-Are-Covered-for-Social-Insurance-PR.aspx">From
2014 certain spouses and civil partners of self-employed sole traders can pay
PRSI</a>. People affected by this change are people who work in their
self-employed spouse or civil partner’s business doing similar or ancillary
(supporting) tasks but who are not business partners or employees. The €5,000
income threshold applies to spouses or civil partners in the same way as other
self-employed people, so if a spouse or civil partner earns less than this
threshold they are not liable to pay PRSI. </p>

<p>If you are an employee of a <strong>limited company</strong> that is owned
by your spouse or a family member, you are insurable at PRSI Class A (or Class
J). If you are not an employee but participate in the running of the company or
if you hold a directorship or shareholding position and have control over its
operations, you may be treated as a self-employed contributor and liable to pay
Class S PRSI (provided you earn more than €5,000).</p>

<p>Two or more family members who operate a business as a
<strong>partnership</strong> and share the profits are insurable as
self-employed contributors at Class S (if they earn over €5,000). Family
members employed by a partnership pay Class A (or Class J).</p>

<h3>Insurance</h3>

<p>Although you are not legally obliged to be insured when you are carrying on
a business, it generally advisable to have insurance cover for various
situations. In particular if the public have access to your premises you should
have public liability insurance. </p>

<p>You may also want to look into <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/insurance/insurance.html">other types of
insurance</a> such as <a href="../../../health/health_system/private_health_insurance.html">health
insurance</a>. The Irish Insurance Federation provides a <a href="http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/insurance-information-service">free
insurance information service</a> where you can obtain information and advice
on all aspects of insurance. </p>

<h3>Planning permission</h3>

<p>If you are working from home you may need <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/planning_permission/planning_perm_altering_a_house.html">planning
permission</a>, for example, if you are using part of your home for business
purposes or if you were to build a shed or an office in your garden. You should
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentAdministration/LocalAuthorities/">contact
your local authority</a> for advice about planning permission.</p>

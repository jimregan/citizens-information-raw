<p>The <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/en_act_2012_0047.htm">National
Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012-2016,</a> which came
into effect on 29 April 2016, make it mandatory for people working with
children or vulnerable adults to be vetted by the Garda Síochána National
Vetting Bureau.</p>

<p>You can read more information in these <a href="https://vetting.garda.ie/Help/FAQ">frequently asked questions about Garda
vetting</a> on the National Vetting Bureau website.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l7c58c">National Vetting Bureau</h2>

<p>The National Vetting Bureau of the Garda Síochána (formerly the Garda
Central Vetting Unit) deals with requests to provide information on certain
prospective employees or other workers. The Bureau carries out vetting for <a href="https://vetting.garda.ie/RegisteredOrganisation/Relevant">relevant
organisations</a> that are registered with it. Read more about the <a href="https://vetting.garda.ie/VettingProcedure/HowIsVettingConducted">vetting
procedure</a> here.</p>

<p>Vetting is not done for individuals on a personal basis – see
‘Requesting personal data’ below.</p>

<h3>Who must be vetted?</h3>

<p>Under the Acts, any person whose work or activity involves access to
children or vulnerable adults must be vetted. Workers include staff, volunteers
and those on student placements working for a <em>relevant organisation</em>
through which they have access to children and/or vulnerable adults. <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2012/act/47/section/2/enacted/en/html#sec2">Section
2</a> defines “relevant organisation” as one that employs or permits a
person to carry out work or activities which mainly consist of them having
access to, or contact with, children or vulnerable adults.</p>

<p><strong>Self-employed:</strong> Vetting is not conducted for individual
persons on a personal basis. Applications for self-employed people can only be
submitted through a relevant organisation as defined in Section 2 of the
Act.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://vetting.garda.ie/RegisteredOrganisation/RelevantWork">work or
activities</a> where people working with children and vulnerable adult will
require vetting include:</p>
<ul><li>Childcare services – see also ‘Further information’ below</li>
  <li>Schools </li>
  <li>Hospitals and health services</li>
  <li>Residential services or accommodation for children or vulnerable
  persons</li>
  <li>Treatment, therapy or counselling services for children or vulnerable
    persons</li>
  <li>Provision of leisure, sporting or physical activities to children or
    vulnerable persons</li>
  <li>Promotion of religious beliefs</li>
</ul><p><strong>Private security employees:</strong> Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0012/index.html">Private
Security Services Act 2004</a> Garda vetting has been extended to private
security employees (for example, bouncers and nightclub security staff).</p>

<h3>Details disclosed </h3>

<p>When a prospective worker is vetted by the National Vetting Bureau, their
criminal record (if any) is disclosed to the authorised liaison person in the
registered organisation – see ‘How to apply’ below. A vetting disclosure
will include details of all convictions and pending prosecutions and a
statement of specified information* (if any) or a statement that there is no
criminal record or specified information relating to the person being
vetted.</p>

<p>*<a href="https://vetting.garda.ie/VettingProcedure/SpecifiedInformation">Specified
information</a> (also known as “soft” information) is information other
than criminal convictions where such information leads to a bona-fide belief
that a person poses a threat to children or vulnerable people.</p>

<p><strong>Minor offences:</strong> Under Section 14A of the Acts <a href="https://vetting.garda.ie/VettingProcedure/WhatIsDisclosed">convictions
for certain minor offences</a> in the District Court that are over 7 years old
are not included in the disclosure. However this provision does not apply to
offences that are specified in <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/en_act_2012_0047.htm#SCHED3">Schedule
3</a> of the Acts and in <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/act/4/schedule/1/enacted/en/html#sched1">Schedule
1</a> of the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act
2016.</p>

<p><strong>Re-vetting: </strong>Section 20 of the Acts provides for the
re-vetting of employees and other workers after a certain period of time which
is to be set out in regulations. Until then, good practice suggests that
re-vetting should be carried out every 5 years.</p>

<h3>Non-Act vetting</h3>

<p>The National Vetting Bureau also does vetting which is not governed by the
National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012–2016 but
is required by other legislation. For example, people applying to work for
certain bodies, such as the Garda Síochána, the Courts Service and some
government departments have to disclose any spent convictions. The vetting
process is the same except that specified information is not disclosed for
these <a href="https://vetting.garda.ie/VettingProcedure/NonAct">Non-Act
applications</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="ldae19">Other personal data issues</h2>

<h3>Spent convictions</h3>

<p><strong></strong>In general, when you apply for a job that does
<strong>not</strong> require Garda vetting, you must give details of any
criminal convictions. However, if you are convicted of an offence covered by <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/act/4/section/5/enacted/en/html#sec5">Section
5</a> of the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act
2016, you do not have to disclose the conviction after 7 years, except in
certain circumstances. You can read more in our document on <a href="../../../justice/criminal_law/spent_convictions.html">spent
convictions</a>.</p>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/sec0258.html#sec258">Section
258 of the Children Act 2001</a>, if someone committed an offence when aged
under 18 for which they have been found guilty, the offence can be
automatically expunged from the record as if never committed, once certain
conditions are met. You can read more information in our document, <a href="../../../justice/children_and_young_offenders/children_and_the_criminal_justice_system_in_ireland.html">Children
and the criminal justice system.</a> </p>

<h3>Requesting personal data</h3>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.dataprotection.ie/documents/legal/CompendiumAct.pdf">Data
Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 (pdf)</a> you have the <a href="http://www.garda.ie/controller.aspx?Page=1548">right to access personal
data about you</a> that is held by an Garda Siochána. You can request this
information either in writing or by completing a <a href="http://www.garda.ie/Documents/User/Data%20Protection%20F20%20-%20Nov%2012.pdf">Data
Protection Access Request form (pdf)</a>. Your written request or completed
form should be sent to the National Vetting Bureau of the Garda Síochána –
see ‘Where to apply’ below. You must enclose the following:</p>
<ul><li>Fee of €6.35 – you can pay by cheque, money order or postal order
    made payable to: The Accountant, Department of Justice</li>
  <li>Photocopy of your passport or birth certificate or driving licence or
    other identification</li>
</ul><p>A disclosure in response to your data protection access request will be sent
directly to you for your personal use. If you request a copy of your criminal
record from the Garda Síochána, the record will be provided in 2 parts, with
the spent convictions provided separately from the other convictions (if any).
It is not the same as Garda vetting, a Police Certificate, a Garda Reference or
proof of no convictions.</p>

<p><strong>Employers:</strong> Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2003/act/6/section/5/enacted/en/html#sec5">section
4</a> of the Data Protection Acts, it is illegal for an employer to require an
employee or a potential employee to make a data protection access request
(“enforced subject access request”). The Data Protection Commissioner has
published <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/viewdoc.asp?m=m&amp;fn=/documents/guidance/EmployeeVettingGuidance.htm">guidance
on data protection considerations when vetting prospective employees</a>.</p>

<h3>Police Certificate</h3>

<p>It is important to remember that Garda vetting is not the same as obtaining
a Police Certificate which is provided by the Gardaí to people in Ireland who
need them for a range of reasons. These reasons may include starting a business
abroad or in order to obtain a visa for another country. You can find further
information in our document on <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_abroad/leaving_ireland/police_certificate.html">Police
Certificates.</a></p>

<h3>Organisations</h3>

<p>An organisation that requires Garda vetting of individuals must register
with the National Vetting Bureau – see ‘Where to apply’ below. The
organisation must appoint a liaison person to apply for and receive vetting
disclosures.</p>

e-Vetting</a> but you may <a href="https://vetting.garda.ie/Application/Paper">apply using a paper form</a>
instead. If you are aged under 18 you must submit a signed parent or guardian
consent form.</p>

<p><strong>e-Vetting</strong></p>

<p>To use <a href="https://vetting.garda.ie/Application/About">e-Vetting</a>
you must be aged over 16. You must have a valid email address and complete the
“proof of identity” process.</p>

<p>The e-Vetting procedure is as follows:</p>

    where you are applying for a position. You must complete the form and
    return to the organisation together with proof of your identity.</li>
  <li>The organisation will validate your proof of identity and send you an
    email with a link to the vetting application form.</li>
  <li>You complete the vetting application form online and submit it to the
    organisation.</li>
  <li>The organisation reviews your vetting application form and submits it to
    the National Vetting Bureau.</li>
  <li>The National Vetting Bureau processes the application and sends a vetting
    disclosure to the organisation.</li>
  <li>The organisation reviews the disclosure and will send you a copy of
  it.</li>
</ol><p>You can track your <a href="https://vetting.garda.ie/Track">e-Vetting
application</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Disputes and appeals</strong></p>

<p>If you wish to <a href="https://vetting.garda.ie/Disputes/Disclosure">dispute the detail in the
vetting disclosure,</a> you should write to the liaison person in the
organisation with a summary of the basis for your dispute. The liaison person
will then send the complete application file to the National Vetting Bureau to
be re-checked.</p>

<p>If you wish to appeal the decision of the Chief Officer of the National
Vetting Bureau in relation to disclosure of specified information, there is an
<a href="https://vetting.garda.ie/Disputes/Appeal">independent appeals
process</a>.</p>

<h3>Vetting of childcare workers</h3>

<p>The national standards for children’s residential centres include a
requirement that all staff, students and volunteers are appropriately vetted,
to include references and Garda Síochána and/or police authority criminal
record checks, before taking up duties. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/si/0550.html">Child Care (Special
Care) Regulations 2004</a> provide that the HSE or voluntary body or any other
person providing or maintaining a special care unit will ensure that staff or
others who have access to children are appropriately vetted. That is, by
obtaining references and Garda Síochána and/or other police authority
criminal record checks. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/si/221/made/en/print">Child Care
Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016</a> require <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/pre_school_education_and_childcare/health_safety_and_welfare_of_preschool_childcare_services.html">pre-school
childcare services</a> to obtain references and Garda vetting for all staff,
students and volunteers who have access to children. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/si/0260.html">Child Care
(Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations 1995</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/si/0261.html">Child
Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations 1995</a> require that
<a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/adoption_and_fostering/fostering.html">foster
parents</a> or relatives with whom children in the care of the HSE are to be
placed give authorisation to allow the HSE to obtain a statement from the Garda
Síochána as to whether there are any convictions against them or any relevant
member of the household and to provide the names of two referees for reference
purposes. </p>

<p>The issue of the use and surveillance of electronic communications and CCTV
in the workplace raises important issues regarding <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/data_protection.html">data
privacy</a> for both the employer and employee. </p>

<p></p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1a5af">Data privacy</h2>

<p>These data privacy issues, in particular, affect the surveillance of
electronic communications and CCTV at work. This document gives an overview of
the current rules in place regarding data privacy and surveillance and explains
the rights and entitlements of both the employer and employee. </p>

<p>While the <a href="http://www.dataprotection.ie/documents/legal/CompendiumAct.pdf">Data
Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 (pdf)</a> set out the rights and entitlements of
citizens regarding the issue of data privacy, the issue of surveillance of
electronic communications in the workplace is not specifically legislated for.
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.dataprotection.ie/documents/legal/SI5352003.doc">The European
Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Data Protection
and Privacy) Regulations 2003 (SI 535/2003)</a> introduced provisions relating
to the confidentiality of communications. </p>

<p>However, under Article 29 of the European Directive 95/46/EC, a working
group of Data Privacy Commissioners produced a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/docs/wpdocs/2002/wp55_en.pdf">Working
Document - WP55 (pdf)</a> on the issue of surveillance of electronic
communications in the workplace. The views expressed in the working document
are largely in line with the opinions of the Data Protection Commissioner. </p>

<h3>Privacy in the workplace</h3>

<p>While employees have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the workplace,
this right must be balanced with the rights and interests of the employer. (In
particular, the employer's right to run their business efficiently and above
all, to protect themselves from any liability or harm an employee's actions may
create.) These rights and interests constitute legitimate grounds that may
justify appropriate measures to limit the worker's right to privacy. Examples
of these could include:</p>
<ul><li>Where the employer is victim of a worker's criminal offence</li>
  <li>Where the employees’ use of social networking sites causes damage to
    the employer’s business reputation or releases confidential
  information</li>
  <li>Dealing with cyber bullying in the workplace, that is, bullying carried
    out on the internet and mobile phones, through social networking sites,
    email and texts. You can read more about <a href="../../equality_in_work/bullying_in_the_workplace.html">bullying in
    the workplace</a>.</li>
</ul><p>However, balancing different rights and interests requires taking a number
of principles into account, in particular, proportionality. It should be clear
that the simple fact that a monitoring activity or surveillance is considered
convenient to serve the employer's interest would not solely justify any
intrusion into a worker's privacy.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lc8cf8">Obligations on employers - statement of
policy</h2>

<p>Employers must provide workers with a readily accessible, clear and accurate
statement of policy with regard to email and internet use, including the use of
social media, in the workplace. This should clearly describe the extent to
which the employees can use communication facilities, either owned by the
company or personal remote devices such as smartphones, for personal or private
communications. For example, the policy may place a limitation on the duration
and times of use. </p>

<p>On the website of the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) you can find <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dataprotection.ie/viewdoc.asp?m=m&amp;fn=/documents/guidance/3gm3.htm">guidance
notes on monitoring staff which include the DPC office policy on email and
internet use for use as a template</a>.</p>

<h3>Internet use</h3>

<p>The working document of the working group of Data Privacy Commissioners
recommends that the internet use policy should contain, at the minimum, the
following elements:</p>
<ul><li>The employer must set out clearly to employees the conditions under which
    private use of the internet is permitted as well as specifying material
    that cannot be viewed or copied. These conditions and limitations must be
    explained to employees.</li>
  <li>Employees need to be informed about the systems implemented both to
    prevent access to certain websites and to detect misuse. The extent of such
    monitoring should be specified, for instance, whether such monitoring may
    relate to individuals or particular sections of the company or whether the
    content of the websites visited is viewed or recorded by the employer in
    particular circumstances. Furthermore, the policy should specify what use,
    if any, will be made of any data collected in relation to who visited what
    websites.</li>
  <li>Employees should be informed about the involvement of their
    representatives, (for example, trade union representatives), both in the
    implementation of the policy and in the investigation of alleged
  breaches.</li>
</ul><p>If surveillance or monitoring of communications use is to be carried out,
the reasons and purposes for which this will be undertaken must be made clear
to employees. Where an employer has allowed the use of the company's
communications facilities for private use by employees, such private
communications may be subject to some surveillance, for example, to ensure
adequate virus checking. Details of surveillance measures to be undertaken must
be clearly identified, for example, what type of surveillance and how and when
it will be done.</p>

<p>All these issues should be addressed and included in the employer's
policy.</p>

<p>In the event of a breach of internal electronic communication use, the
employer must have set out enforcement procedures in the company policy. In
addition, the employer must have clearly set down the opportunities given to
employees to respond to breaches of policy. From a practical point of view, it
is strongly advised that the employer immediately informs the worker of any
misuse of electronic communications that is detected, unless important reasons
justify the continuance of the surveillance. Employees can be informed through
software such as pop-up warning windows. </p>

<h3>Email</h3>

<p>Before implementing any e-mail monitoring policy in the workplace, employers
must ask themselves:</p>
<ul><li>Whether the workers know that the e-mail will be monitored </li>
  <li>Whether the monitoring is necessary. Could the same results be achieved
    with traditional methods of supervision? </li>
  <li>Whether the proposed processing of personal data is fair to employees
  </li>
  <li>Whether the monitoring is in proportion to the concerns it tries to
    address. </li>
</ul><p>The monitoring of e-mails should, if possible, be limited to traffic data on
the participants and time of a communication rather than the contents of
communications if this would be sufficient to allay employers concerns. No
covert e-mail monitoring is allowed by employers, except in a case where
specific criminal activity has been identified and the surveillance is required
to obtain evidence and subject to the respect of legal and procedural rules.
For example, if the employer or police suspects that an employee is using
workplace e-mail and the internet contrary to the provisions of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0022/index.html">Child
Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998.</a> </p>

<p>If access to an e-mail's content is absolutely necessary, the employer
should take into account the privacy of people outside the organisation
receiving the e-mail as well as those inside. The employer, for instance,
cannot obtain the consent of people outside the organisation sending e-mails to
its workers. The employer should make reasonable efforts to inform people
outside the organisation of the existence of monitoring activities to the
extent that these people could be affected by them. An example could be the
insertion of warning notices regarding the existence of the monitoring systems,
which may be added to all outbound e-mails from the organisation. </p>

<p>Any personal data from or related to an employee's e-mail account or his or
her use of the internet that is legitimately stored by an employer must be
accurate and up to date and not kept for longer than necessary. Employers
should specify a retention period for e-mails in their central servers based on
their business needs and have procedures in place to ensure that retention
period is not exceeded. The employer must put in place appropriate technical
and organisational measures to ensure that any personal data it holds is secure
and safe from outside intrusion. </p>

<h3>CCTV</h3>

<p>All usage of CCTV other than in a purely domestic context must be undertaken
in compliance with the requirements of data protection legislation. As CCTV
infringes the privacy of the persons captured in the images there must be a
genuine reason for installing such a system. If installing such a system, it is
required that the purpose for its use be displayed in a prominent position.</p>

<p>Employers may use CCTV to monitor the workplace for various reasons. If CCTV
is installed in a workplace, the employer should use signage to inform
employees of the location of the cameras and to explain the purpose for which
they are installed. Under the Data Protection Acts, if your employer informed
you that the CCTV cameras were installed to prevent, for example, theft from
the workplace, the CCTV footage cannot be used for another purpose such as
recording the entry and exit of employees from the workplace.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>When your employer has a downturn in business or there is less work for you
to do, your employer may ask you to take a pay cut or to work fewer hours. If
your employer tells you that he or she is unable to continue employing you on
your current terms and conditions of employment you need to consider your
employer’s request very carefully. You should ask your employer for details
of the reduced business activity, who else has been asked to reduce their hours
of work or pay and what were the criteria for selection. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l94d90">Reduction of working hours or pay</h2>

<p>If your employer asks you to work fewer hours or take a pay cut, this is a
change to your <a shape="rect" href="contract_of_employment.html">contract of
employment</a>. Any change to your contract of employment must be agreed by
both you and your employer. When deciding whether or not to agree to working
reduced hours or to a reduction in pay, there are a number of issues to be
considered:</p>
<ul><li>Reduced pay – what are the implications of this – for example, money
    and <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/">tax</a> and
    paying the <a href="../../../housing/renting_a_home/rent_increases.html">rent</a> or
    <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/owning_a_home/help_with_buying_a_home/paying_for_a_home.html">mortgage
    </a></li>
  <li>Scheduling of working hours – it may suit you and your family to reduce
    your hours, for example working a day less per week or 2 hours less each
    day. </li>
  <li>Downturn in business – what choice do you have. If you don’t accept a
    reduction in your working hours or pay, your employer may decide to make
    you <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/overview_redundancy.html">redundant</a>.
  </li>
</ul><p>You should ask your employer to give you written details of this proposed
change to your contract of employment including a review date. You should
respond to this in writing and if you are proposing to accept the change, you
should stress that your acceptance is temporary. At the review date the change
to your contract can be reconsidered and you could ask to return to the
original terms and conditions of your contract.</p>

<p><strong>Minimum wage:</strong> In some cases an employment contract or terms
of employment will say that an employee is paid at the "prevailing National
Minimum Wage hourly rate". Where this is the case, an employer may reduce the
employee's pay in line with the minimum wage rates. In other cases there may be
a provision in the contract that provides for a reduction in pay. Where this is
not the case, your employer cannot reduce it without your agreement, as this
would change the terms of your contract of employment. Again, you may agree to
reduced wages, if, for example, the alternative may be reduced hours or
redundancy in the current economic situation.</p>

<h3>If you do not agree to reduced working hours or pay</h3>

<p>If your employer proposes to reduce your working hours or pay, this is a <a shape="rect" href="change_job_contract.html">change to your terms and
conditions of employment</a>. You may agree to the reduction for reasons as
described above.</p>

<p>If you do not agree to this reduction there are a number of options
available to you:</p>
<ul><li>You may make a complaint to the <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace
    Relations Commission</a> under the Industrial Relations Acts 1969-2015.
    Under this legislation, if your employer objects to a hearing by a <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/rights_commissioner.html">Workplace
    Relations Commission adjudicator</a>, you would have to refer the matter to
    the <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/employment_appeals.html">Labour
    Court</a>.</li>
</ul><ul><li>If you say you wish to continue working as before your employer may
    decide to make you redundant. If you are dismissed in this way, you may
    qualify to bring a <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">claim
    for unfair dismissal</a>. Unless your employer can prove there was a
    genuine redundancy situation and that <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/redundancy.html">fair
    procedures were followed,</a> this dismissal may be found to be unfair.
  </li>
</ul><ul><li>If your employer insists on reducing your working hours or pay you may
    also consider that you have no choice but to resign and claim <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/constructive_dismissal.html">constructive
    dismissal</a> because your employer has breached the terms of your
    contract. Before you do this, you should always seek detailed legal advice
    as proving constructive dismissal can often be difficult.</li>
</ul><ul><li>If you think that a reduction in your pay or your working hours is a
    breach of your employment contract you could seek redress through the <a href="../../../justice/civil_law/">civil courts</a>.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lcdc00">Lay off or short-time working</h2>

<p>Alternatively your employer may <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/lay_off_short_time_working_and_redundancy.html">lay
you off or put you on short time</a> for a number of weeks. A lay-off situation
arises where your employer is temporarily unable to provide work for you. A
short-time situation arises where, due to a reduction in the amount of work to
be done, your pay or hours are less than half the normal weekly amount. In both
cases these must be temporary situations and your employer must notify you
before they start. The best way to do this is by using Part A of form <a href="http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Lay_Off_and_Short_Term_Procedures_Form_RP9_.pdf">RP9
(pdf)</a>. Your employer can lay you off or put you on short time if it is in
your contract of employment or it is custom and practice in your workplace.
Otherwise your employer should not lay you off or put you on short time without
your agreement. However if you do not agree you may be made redundant. </p>

<p><strong>Claiming redundancy:</strong> If a lay-off or a short-time situation
has continued for 4 weeks or more, or for 6 weeks in the last 13 weeks, you may
claim a redundancy lump sum. If you claim redundancy in this way you are
considered to have left your job voluntarily and therefore you will lose any
right to <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/losing_your_job/losing_job_entitlements.html">notice
or pay in lieu of notice from your employer</a>. However if you have been laid
off and you are subsequently made redundant by your employer you do not lose
your notice entitlements. </p>

<p><strong>Duration of lay off or short time:</strong> If you do not wish to
claim redundancy but the lay-off or short-time situation continues, the
question arises as to whether it is a temporary situation. If it becomes
apparent that it is no longer temporary then the situation is now a redundancy
rather than a lay-off or short-time working. It is the employer who initially
decides whether or not there is a redundancy situation. If there is a dispute
about this it should be referred to the Workplace Relations Commission to make
a decision.</p>

<h3>Social welfare payments</h3>

<p>If your hours of work are reduced so that you are unemployed for at least 4
out of 7 consecutive days you may be entitled to a social welfare jobseeker’s
payment.</p>

<p>To qualify for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker’s
Benefit</a> you must have enough PRSI contributions and must have suffered a
substantial loss of employment in any period of 7 consecutive days. This means,
you must have lost at least one day's employment and as a result of this loss
be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 days. Your earnings must also have
been reduced because of the loss of employment.</p>

<p>If your employer reduces your days at work to 3 days a week or less and you
do not qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit you may get <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
Allowance</a> for the other days. You must meet the other conditions that apply
to Jobseeker's Allowance, for example, you must satisfy a means test.</p>

<p>It may be possible to get <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
Income Supplement</a> if you have a family and your pay or hours are
reduced.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lf1047">Redundancy</h2>

<h3>Redundancy payment</h3>

<p>If you were made redundant within one year of being put on reduced hours or
pay, your redundancy payment would be based on your earnings for a full week.
If you are made redundant after working reduced hours for more than a year, how
your payment will be calculated depends on whether you accepted being on
reduced hours or not. If you fully accepted the reduced working hours as your
normal week and never asked to return to full-time work, then your redundancy
payment will be based on your gross pay for the reduced working hours. If, on
the other hand, you never accepted the reduced working hours as your normal
hours and continually asked to be put back on full-time working, your payment
would be based on your normal weekly earnings. If you have a dispute about this
with your employer you could make a claim to the Workplace Relations
Commission.</p>

<h3>Alternative work</h3>

<p>Instead of reducing your working hours your employer may make you <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/redundancy_procedures.html">redundant
</a>and offer you alternative work under a new contract of employment. However
this may affect your <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/redundancy_procedures.html">entitlement
to a redundancy payment</a>.</p>

<p>If your employer makes you a reasonable offer of alternative work, and you
refuse it, you may lose your entitlement to a redundancy payment. Generally
speaking, alternatives which involve a loss of status or worsening of the terms
and conditions of your employment would not be considered reasonable.</p>

<p>You may take up an alternative on a trial basis for up to 4 weeks. Where the
alternative involves a reduction of 50% or more in hours or pay, working under
the new arrangements for up to 52 weeks will not count as an acceptance. </p>

<p>If you accept an offer in writing from your employer for a new and different
contract which will take effect within 4 weeks of the ending of the previous
contract, you will not be entitled to claim redundancy. Equally, if you refuse
such an offer unreasonably, you will lose your right to a redundancy payment.</p>

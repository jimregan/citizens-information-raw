<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Employees on fixed-term contracts have broadly similar rights to those on
open-ended contracts. The majority of employees work under open-ended contracts
of employment. In other words, the contract continues until such time as the
employer or employee ends it. Many other employees however, work under
fixed-term contracts. </p>

<p>The term, <em>fixed-term </em><em>employee</em>, covers employees whose
contract ends on a specified date, or when a specific task is completed, or
when a specific event occurs. Generally, a fixed-term contract ends on an
agreed date. The period of such a contract may range from a matter of months up
to a period of a year or more. However, a fixed-term contract can also involve
a specified-purpose and so may not end on a specific date. Rather, it is agreed
that the contract will finish when a particular stated task is completed, such
as replacing an employee while she is on maternity leave. </p>

<p>The expression, <em>fixed-term contract</em>, is used for convenience here.
It also includes specified-purpose contracts. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l97d76">Rights of employees on fixed-term
contracts</h2>

<p>Generally speaking, people employed under such contracts have the same
rights as other employees. For example, employees with fixed-term contracts
have the normal entitlement to <a shape="rect" href="../leave_and_holidays/annual_leave_public_holidays.html">annual leave</a>
(holidays), <a shape="rect" href="../leave_and_holidays/maternity_leave.html">maternity leave</a>, and <a shape="rect" href="../pay_and_employment/pay_slip.html">wage slips</a>. The <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1994_0005.htm">Terms
of Employment (Information) Acts 1994–2014</a> require that employees with a
fixed-term contract get written notice of the expiry date.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0029/index.html">Protection
of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003</a> applies to most employees on
fixed-term contracts. However, it does not apply to agency workers placed by a
temporary work agency at the disposition of a user enterprise or to
apprentices, trainees and people in publicly-funded employment schemes such as
Community Employment. The Act does apply to agency workers employed directly by
an employment agency.</p>

<p>The Act provides that fixed-term employees may not be treated less
favourably than comparable permanent employees unless the employer can
objectively justify the different treatment. Any justification offered cannot
be connected with the fact that the employee is on a fixed-term contract. The
definition of comparable employees, the conditions attached and the enforcement
mechanisms are similar to those for <a href="../../types_of_employment/part_time_employment/employment_rights_of_part_time_workers.html">part-time
employees</a>. </p>

<p>Only those fixed-term employees whose normal hours of work are less than 20%
of the normal hours of the comparable permanent employees can be excluded from
entitlement to join a pension scheme. </p>

<p>As far as is practicable, an employer is required to help a fixed-term
employee to access training to enhance skills, career development and job
mobility. </p>

<p><strong>Maternity leave:</strong> an employee on a fixed-term contract is
entitled to full maternity leave. However, if her fixed-term contract ends
before the last day of maternity leave, this counts as the last day of
maternity leave. This means that if the fixed-term contract ends during
maternity leave, then the employee’s contract of employment terminates on
that date. This does not affect entitlement to the full 26 weeks of Maternity
Benefit.</p>

<h3>Written statement </h3>

<p>An employer must provide a fixed-term employee with a written statement as
soon as possible, outlining what will trigger an end to the contract. That is,
whether the contract will end on a specific date, following completion of a
specific task or a specific event. In addition, where an employer intends to
renew a fixed-term contract, a written statement must be supplied to the
fixed-term employee not later than the date of renewal, setting out the
objective grounds justifying the renewal and the failure to offer an open-ended
contract. </p>

<p>Employers are obliged to inform fixed-term employees of vacancies for
permanent positions. This may be done by means of a general announcement. </p>

<h3>Dismissal </h3>

<p>When an employee is dismissed at the end of the contract the unfair
dismissals legislation applies as normal unless the employer has availed of the
provision to exclude the operation of the legislation. To avail of that
provision, the employer must put the contract in writing. The employer must
include a clause stating that the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977–2007 will not
apply where the only reason for ending the contract is the expiry of the fixed
term, or the completion of the specified purpose. Both the employer and the
employee must sign the contract. </p>

<h3>Redundancy</h3>

<p>An employee who has worked continuously for at least 104 weeks under a
fixed-term or specified purpose contract may qualify for a <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/redundancy_payments.html">redundancy
payment</a> when the contract ends.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lcd25a">Renewal of fixed-term contracts</h2>

<p>Employees may not be employed on a series of fixed-term contracts
indefinitely. There are 2 possible situations where this arises as follows: </p>
<ul><li>If an employee whose employment started <strong>before</strong> 14 July
    2003 has completed 3 years’ continuous service as a fixed-term employee,
    the employer may renew their fixed-term contract only once for a period of
    no more than 1 year. </li>
  <li>If an employee whose employment started <strong>after </strong>14 July
    2003 has been employed on 2 or more continuous fixed-term contracts, the
    total duration of those contracts may not exceed 4 years. </li>
</ul><p>After this, if the employer wishes to renew the employee’s contract, it
must be an open-ended contract unless there are objective grounds justifying
the renewal of the contract for a fixed term only. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1977_0010.htm">Unfair
Dismissal Acts 1977–2015</a> contain a provision aimed at ensuring that
successive temporary contracts are not used in order to avoid that legislation.
Where a fixed-term or specified-purpose contract expires and the individual is
re-employed within 3 months, the individual is deemed to have continuous
service. </p>

<p>Therefore, even where an employer excludes the unfair dismissals legislation
in the manner described above, an <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/rights_commissioner.html">adjudicator of
the Workplace Relations Commission</a> will consider whether the use of such
contracts was wholly or partly to avoid the employee having the protection of
the unfair dismissals legislation. If it is considered that this was the case
and the contracts were not separated by more than 3 months and the job was at
least similar, then the case can be dealt with as if there was continuous
employment and the employer will be required to justify the dismissal in the
normal manner. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If a business is taken over by another employer as a result of a legal
merger or transfer the rights of the employees are protected by legislation.
The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/si/0131.html">European Communities
(Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003</a>
apply to an <em>undertaking</em> which can be a business but could also be a
charity or non-profit-making organisation. All of the business where you work
need not be transferred; if the part you work in is being sold off or
contracted out, the Regulations will apply. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>For a transfer of undertaking to take place: </p>
<ul><li>There must be a change in the person (either an individual or a company)
    responsible for running the undertaking/business </li>
  <li>The previous economic activity of the undertaking/business must be
    carried on by the new employer </li>
  <li>The undertaking/business must be transferred as a "going concern". </li>
</ul><p>A transfer under the Regulations does not occur in the case of a compulsory
liquidation of the undertaking/business. </p>

<h3>Contract of employment</h3>

<p>Under the Regulations the new employer is legally obliged to take on the
existing employees of the business. The terms and conditions and your
employer’s obligations in your <a shape="rect" href="contract_of_employment.html">contract of employment</a> are automatically
transferred to your new employer, except for pensions – see below. If there
is a collective agreement your new employer must continue to its terms and
conditions until it expires or is replaced.</p>

<p><strong>P45:</strong> In some circumstances employees involved in a transfer
of business may be given a P45 by their old employer. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/paye/guide/employers-guide-paye-cessation.html#section9">They
should give this to their new employer.</a> For the purposes of <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/redundancy.html">redundancy
legislation</a> a transfer of business does not break the employees’
continuity of service. Instead it is transferred to their new employment.</p>

<h3>Pensions</h3>

<p>Employee pension rights, apart from those provided for by social welfare
legislation, do not transfer to the new employment. However, where there is a
pension scheme in operation in the original employer’s business at the time
of the transfer, the legislation provides that: </p>
<ul><li>If the scheme is an occupational pension scheme covered by the Pension
    Acts, then the protections given by that legislation apply </li>
  <li>In the case of other pension schemes, the new employer must ensure that
    rights are protected </li>
</ul><h3>Dismissal</h3>

<p>The transfer of an undertaking, business or part of a business does not in
itself constitute grounds for dismissal. However, nothing in the regulations
prohibits dismissal if your employer can justify such dismissal for economic,
technical or organisational reasons. Whether there are economic, technical or
organisational grounds for dismissal will depend on the facts of each case and
you can challenge your employer's contention that such grounds exist by
bringing a claim for <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfair
dismissal</a> - see 'How to apply' below. </p>

<h3>Unfair dismissal</h3>

<p>If your contract of employment is terminated because a transfer involves a
substantial change in working conditions to your detriment, the employer
concerned is regarded as having been responsible for the termination of the
employment. So, for example, if your new employer cuts your wages because
he/she feels you are being paid too much and you resign as a result, your new
employer will be regarded as being responsible for the dismissal by failing to
honour your contract of employment.</p>

<h3>Consultation</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0009/index.html">Employees
(Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006</a> provides a general
right to information and consultation for employees from their employer on
matters which directly affect them. The legislation requires employers to
inform and consult employees on any decisions likely to lead to substantial
changes in work organisation or contractual relations – with particular
reference to mergers and acquisitions and to collective redundancies. This
means that employers are required to consult with employees before major
decisions are made, including transfer of business. Since 23 March 2008 it
applies to employers with at least 50 employees. </p>

<p>Under the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of
Undertakings) Regulations 2003 employees (including those who are not covered
by the Act as they are working for an employer with fewer than 50 employees)
must be given details of the transfer as follows:</p>
<ul><li>If the employees are in a union, not later than 30 days before the
    transfer, the employer must provide the union with details of the reasons
    for the transfer; the date or proposed date of the transfer; and the legal,
    economic and social implications for the employees </li>
  <li>If the employees are not in a union, the employer must give the details
    already mentioned in writing to each employee not later than 30 days before
    the transfer </li>
</ul><p>The employer must also consult with the employees’ union or, in the
absence of a union, with the chosen representative(s) of the employees. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you have been dismissed because of the transfer or if your employer has
failed to consult the employees or their representatives, as required by the
Regulations, you can bring a complaint within 6 months. You must use the online
complaint form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.
The time limit may be extended for up to a further 6 months, but only where
there is reasonable cause which prevented the complaint being brought within
the normal time limit.</p>

<p>Complaints concerning pensions covered by the Pensions Acts should be
referred to the Pensions Authority - see 'Where to apply' below. Complaints
concerning other pensions should be referred as above.</p>

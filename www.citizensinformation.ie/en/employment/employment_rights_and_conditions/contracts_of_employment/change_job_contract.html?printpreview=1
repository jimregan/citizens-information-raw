<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l07de2">Introduction </h2>

<p>Changes to your <a shape="rect" href="contract_of_employment.html">contract
of employment</a> can occur due to a change in the law, but otherwise, changes
must be agreed between your employer and yourself. Neither party can
unilaterally decide to change the contract. This requirement for both the
employer's and the employee's consent to changes in the terms of the contract
is part of contract law. This principle is not affected by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0005/index.html">Terms of
Employment (Information) Acts 1994-2014</a> which sets out the procedures for
the employer informing the employee of any changes to the statement of the
terms of employment.</p>

<h3>Changes introduced by law</h3>

<p>Where the law introduces changes into your contract of employment, for
example, by extending the statutory period of maternity leave, then both you
and your employer must comply with the law.</p>

<h3>Changes introduced by agreement</h3>

<p>The nature of your job may change, so that you are doing a different job for
the same employer. Such a major change will probably also result in changes to
your terms and conditions of employment. Unless your contract already allows
certain changes to be introduced, you or your employer cannot introduce change
unilaterally. There must be agreement between the parties. Where such an
agreement is reached, you must be given the details of change(s) in writing
within 1 month of their coming into operation. </p>

<h3>Contractual terms and work practices</h3>

<p>Legally there is a distinction between the terms in your contract of
employment and work practices. </p>

<p><em>Contractual terms</em> include pay, hours of work, sick pay and pension
scheme. All of your contractual terms may not be in the written statement of
your terms and conditions of employment. Some of your contractual terms could
be in your staff handbook, a pension scheme booklet or a collective agreement.
You can read more about contractual terms in our document on <a shape="rect" href="contract_of_employment.html">contract of employment</a>. Changes to these
terms must be agreed between you and your employer. </p>

<p><em>Work practices</em> can include breaks and rostering, for example.
Details of these may also be in your staff handbook and your employer may
change these work practices without your consent. It is considered reasonable
for an employer to update work practices or processes to save money or increase
efficiency.</p>

<h3>Being asked to reduce your pay or hours of work</h3>

<p>When your employer has a downturn in business or there is less work for you
to do, your employer may ask you to <a shape="rect" href="being_asked_to_reduce_your_hours_of_work.html">take a pay cut or to work
fewer hours</a>. You should consider this request very carefully. If your
employer's business activity is reduced, this may mean that if you don’t
accept a reduction in your working hours or pay you may lose your job due to <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/redundancy.html">redundancy</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The legislation covering notification of changes to your contract is set out
in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0005/sec0005.html#zza5y1994s5">Section
5</a> of the Terms of Employment (Information) Acts 1994–2014. Essentially,
whenever a change is made or occurs in any part of the contract furnished by an
employer, the employer shall notify the employee in writing of the nature and
date of the change as soon as may be afterwards. They must notify the employee
however not later than:</p>
<ul><li>One month after the change takes effect, or </li>
  <li>Where the change is consequent on the employee being required to work
    outside the State for a period of more than 1 month, the time of the
    employee's departure. </li>
</ul><p>This Act also sets out what terms in your contract must be put in writing.
(For example, your name, job title, company address, date you commenced
employment, etc.). The requirement that you receive a written statement of your
terms of employment is set down under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0005/sec0003.html#zza5y1994s3">Section
3</a> of the Terms of Employment (Information) Acts 1994-2014.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you do not receive the required notification of a change to your
statement of terms of employment, you should first raise this issue with your
employer or the personnel department of your company. If you are a member of a
trade union, you may also raise this with your local representative. If you
still fail to receive a notification of change to your contract, and have tried
raising this issue with your employer, you may make a complaint under the Terms
of Employment (Information) Acts 1994-2014 – see 'Complaints' below.</p>

<p>If your employer makes a significant change in your contract for example by
reducing your pay, you should ask your employer to give you written details of
this proposed change to your contract of employment including a review date.
You should respond to this in writing and if you are proposing to accept the
change, you should stress that your acceptance is temporary. At the review date
the change to your contract can be reconsidered and you could ask to return to
the original terms and conditions of your contract.</p>

<p>If you do not agree and say you wish to continue working as before your
employer may decide to make you redundant. If you are dismissed in this way,
you may qualify to bring a claim for <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfair
dismissal.</a> Unless your employer can prove there was a genuine redundancy
situation and that fair procedures were followed, this dismissal may be found
to be unfair. </p>

<p>If your employer insists on reducing your working hours or pay you may also
consider that you have no choice but to leave your job and claim unfair
dismissal. This type of dismissal is known as <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/constructive_dismissal.html">constructive
dismissal,</a> because although you left the job, the employer forced you to
leave by his/her actions. Before exercising this option, however, you should
always seek detailed <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/legal_aid_and_advice/civil_legal_advice_and_legal_aid.html">legal
advice</a> as proving constructive dismissal can often be difficult.
Alternatively, you could refer the dispute to the <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace
Relations Commission</a> in the hope of resolving the matter, and thus avoid
the necessity for you to leave the job. As the attempts made by the employee to
resolve a grievance before resigning are always relevant in an unfair dismissal
claim involving constructive dismissal, this may be the wisest course of
action.</p>

<h3>Complaints</h3>

<p>If you are making a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission, you
should do so within 6 months of the dispute or complaint occurring. You must
use the online complaint form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.
The time limit may be extended for up to a further 6 months, but only where
there are reasonable circumstances which prevented the complaint being brought
within the normal time limit.</p>

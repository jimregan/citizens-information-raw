<p>Employment law provides protection for employees who feel their rights have
been breached. Complaints, disputes and grievances are heard before a <a shape="rect" href="../../enforcement_and_redress/rights_commissioner.html">Workplace
Relations Commissioner adjudicator</a> who will listen to both sides before
completing an investigation of the complaint and issuing a decision.</p>

<p>Often, disputes between employers and employees can be resolved using <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/workplace_mediation_service.html">mediation</a>.

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Employers are responsible for ensuring all their employees receive certain
basic employment rights. These rights are governed by <a href="employment_law_update.html">detailed employment legislation</a>. If
you employ people or are setting up a business that will employ people you need
to be familiar with your responsibilities and your employees’ rights.</p>

<p>Here we outline the responsibilities of employers. The focus is on your
duties to your employees. You can get more information from the <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Workplace_Relations_Services/Info_Cust_Serv/">Workplace
Relations Commission's Information and Customer Service</a> or from bodies
representing your sector such as <a href="http://www.ibec.ie/">IBEC (the Irish
Business and Employers Confederation)</a> or <a href="http://www.isme.ie/">ISME
(Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Assocation)</a> or the <a href="http://www.sfa.ie/">Small Firms Assocation</a>. The guide for employers,
<a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Employment_Law_Explained.pdf">Employment
Law Explained (pdf)</a> and the general <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Guide-to-Employment-Equality-and-Labour-law-final-June-2016-.pdf">guide
to employment law (pdf)</a> are available on workplacerelations.ie. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.calledi.ie/">Employers' Disability Information
Service</a> provides information and advice for employers on employing staff
with disabilities. </p>

<h3>Employment services and supports</h3>

<p>Intreo is a <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Intreo/Pages/Index.aspx">service from the
Department of Social Protection</a> that provides a single point of contact for
all employment and income supports. It has a range of services for employers
including:</p>
<ul><li>The <a href="http://www.fas.ie/en/Employer/Home/default.htm">Jobs
    Ireland</a> employment service giving employers access to jobseekers</li>
  <li>Financial support for employers creating new and additional jobs through
    the JobsPlus scheme, <a href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/national_internship_scheme.html">JobBridge
    internships</a> and work placement</li>
  <li>Workplace supports to assist employees with disabilities including the <a href="../../employment_and_disability/grant_aid_scheme_for_employers_with_disabled_staff.html">Wage
    Subsidy Scheme</a> and the <a href="../../employment_and_disability/grants_for_employers_to_retain_employees_with_disabilities.html">Employee
    Retention Scheme</a>.</li>
</ul><h3>Definition of an employee</h3>

<p>Employers engage persons on either contracts of service or contracts for
services. Only a person engaged under a contract of service is an employee and
therefore protected by the full range of employment legislation. An independent
contractor or self-employed person will have a contract for services with the
party for whom the work is being done. The distinction between a contract of
service, and a contract for services can sometimes be unclear but the type of
contract a person is engaged under can have serious implications for both
employer and employee in matters such as employment protection legislation,
taxation and social welfare.</p>

<p>You can find more information in our documents about <a href="../../types_of_employment/types_of_employment.html">different types of
employment</a>, <a href="../../types_of_employment/employment_rights_of_part_time_workers.html">part-time
workers,</a> <a href="../../types_of_employment/agency_workers.html">agency
workers</a> and <a href="../contracts_of_employment/fixed_term_or_specified_purpose_contracts.html">workers
on fixed-term or specified purpose contracts</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lf3cab">Contracts and terms of employment</h2>

<p>While the full contract of employment does not have to be in writing, you
must give your employee certain terms and conditions of employment in writing
within 2 months of starting employment. This information must include the full
names of the employer and the employee and details of the job title, the pay,
hours of work, notice requirements. You can read details in our document on the
<a href="../contracts_of_employment/contract_of_employment.html">contract of
employment.</a> </p>

<p>While most terms and conditions of employment are stated in a written
contract or a company handbook you should be aware that custom and practice in
the workplace can also constitute a term of employment, for example, a
mid-morning break of 10 minutes. </p>

<p>If you, as the employer, wish to change a term or condition of employment
you must agree this change with your employee. This requirement for both the
employer’s and the employee’s consent to <a href="../contracts_of_employment/change_job_contract.html">changes in the
terms of the contract</a> is part of contract law.</p>

<h3>Rates of pay</h3>

<p>Most experienced adult workers are entitled to be paid a <a href="../pay_and_employment/pay_inc_min_wage.html">minimum wage of €9.25
per hour</a>. There are however, some exceptions to this minimum wage,
including people employed by close relatives, people aged under 18 and trainees
or apprentices. You must also give your employees <a href="../pay_and_employment/pay_slip.html">payslips</a> showing their wages
and any deductions that have been made.</p>

<h3>Hours of work, breaks and rest periods</h3>

<p>You are responsible for ensuring that your employees are given adequate
rest. The Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 sets down the rules governing
<a href="../hours_of_work/working_week.html">maximum working hours</a> and
<a href="../hours_of_work/rest_periods_and_breaks.html">daily and weekly
rest breaks</a>.</p>

<h3>Leave</h3>

<p>Nearly all employees, full-time, part-time, temporary or casual have <a href="../leave_and_holidays/annual_leave_public_holidays.html">annual
leave</a> and <a href="../leave_and_holidays/public_holidays_in_ireland.html">public
holiday</a> entitlements from the time they start work. Most employees are
entitled to 4 weeks’ paid annual leave per leave year. Part-time
workers’entitlement is generally calculated as 8% of the hours worked subject
to a maximum of 4 working weeks per leave year. Employers can determine the
timing of annual leave, taking into consideration work and personal
requirements; however you should consult your employee or their union in
advance. Your employee can request pay for annual leave in advance. You are
also obliged to allow employees to avail of statutory protective leave, such as
<a href="../leave_and_holidays/maternity_leave.html">maternity leave</a>, <a href="../leave_and_holidays/paternity_leave.html">paternity leave</a>,
health and safety leave, <a href="../leave_and_holidays/parental_leave.html">parental leave,</a> <a href="../leave_and_holidays/adoptive_leave.html">adoptive leave</a>, and <a href="../leave_and_holidays/carers_leave_from_employment.html">carer’s
leave</a>. There is specific legislation setting down the rules for each
entitlement.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l680d2">Tax and PRSI</h2>

<p>You are responsible for deducting the correct amount of tax, PRSI, and
Universal Social Charge from your employees' wages and remitting these to
Revenue using the PAYE system. You also <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/employer_s_duty_to_pay_social_insurance_prsi.html">pay
employer's PRSI contributions</a>. You must <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/employers-paye.html">register as an
employer with Revenue</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/jobsplus.html">JobsPlus</a>
scheme is a employer incentive which encourages and rewards employers who
employ jobseekers on the Live Register. It is designed to encourage employers
and businesses to employ people who have been out of work for long periods.
Eligible employers who recruit full-time employees on or after 1 July 2013 may
apply for the incentive, which will operate on a pilot basis.</p>

<p>The Department of Social Protection will pay the incentive to the employer
monthly in arrears over a 2-year period. It will provide 2 levels of regular
cash payments:</p>
<ul><li>A payment of €7,500 for each person recruited who has been unemployed
    for more than 12 but less than 24 months</li>
  <li>A payment of €10,000 for each person recruited who has been unemployed
    for more than 24 months</li>
</ul><p>You can read the <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/paye/guide/index.html">Employer’s
Guide to PAYE</a> and <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/paye/employer-notices/index.html">recent
changes to the PAYE system</a> on the Revenue website. You can get <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Publications/SW3/Pages/1Introduction.aspx">information
about PRSI from the Department of Social Protection</a>.</p>

<h3>Employment records</h3>

<p>As an employer you are required to keep certain records relating to your
employees. This is to show that you are compliant with employment legislation.
<a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace
Relations Commission</a> inspectors will require access to these records during
an inspection. You can find a <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Employers_Guide_to_Inspections.pdf">guide
to how inspections are carried out (pdf)</a> on workplacerelations.ie.</p>

<p>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 employers have a duty
to ensure <a href="../health_and_safety/health_safety_work.html">employees’safety,
health and welfare at work</a> as far as is reasonably practicable. In order to
prevent workplace injuries and ill health you are required, among other things,
to:</p>
<ul><li>Provide and maintain a safe workplace, machinery and equipment</li>
  <li>Prevent risks from use of any article or substance and from exposure to
    physical agents, noise and vibration</li>
  <li>Prevent any improper conduct or behaviour likely to put the safety,health
    and welfare of employees at risk (“horseplay” and bullying at work come
    within these categories)</li>
  <li>Provide instruction and training to employees on health and safety</li>
  <li>Provide protective clothing and equipment to employees (at no cost to
    employees)</li>
  <li>Appoint a competent person as the organisation’s Safety Officer</li>
</ul><p>Every employer is required to carry out a risk assessment for the workplace
which should identify any hazards in the workplace, assess the risks arising
from such hazards and identify the steps to be taken to deal with any risks.
You must also prepare a safety statement based on the risk assessment. The <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/">Health and Safety Authority</a> provides tools to
help you with these tasks. Employers are obliged to report any accident that
results in an employee missing 3 consecutive days at work (not including the
day of the accident) to the Health and Safety Authority.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="ld5d22">Disciplinary procedures and
dismissal</h2>

<p>The Workplace Relations Commission has a <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Good_Workplace_Relations/codes_practice/COP3/">Code
of Practice: Grievance and Disciplinary Procedures</a> which states that
employers should have written grievance and disciplinary procedures.
Disciplinary procedures set out the stages and process you should follow in
relation to alleged shortcomings of an employee.</p>

<p>Generally, the procedures allow for informal warnings leading to written
warnings and ultimately to dismissal. Under the Unfair Dismissals Acts you are
required to give employees written notice of the procedures to be followed
before <a href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/">dismissal</a>.
This must be done within 28 days of entering the contract of employment.</p>

<p>You should give employees copies of these at the start of their employment.
If you are considering dismissal you must follow fair procedures. This includes
giving your employee appropriate warnings, making them fully aware of the
allegations against them and give them an opportunity to present their side.
You must also give them the opportunity to be represented in any disciplinary
procedures by, for example, a trade union official or other representative.</p>

<p>If you do dismiss an employee you must be able to show that that there were
fair grounds for the dismissal and that fair procedures were followed. You can
read more in our document on <a href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/fair_grounds_for_dismissal.html">fair
grounds for dismissal.</a></p>

<p>You can read about redundancy procedures in our document on <a href="../../types_of_employment/self_employment/closing_or_selling_a_business_in_ireland.html">closing
a business</a>.</p>

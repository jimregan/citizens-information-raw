<p>Joint Labour Committees regulate conditions of employment and set minimum
rates of pay for employees in certain sectors, by means of <a href="employment_regulation_orders_and_registered_employment_agreements.html">Employment
Regulation Orders (EROs)</a>. </p>

<p>A Joint Labour Committee (JLC) is established by a statutory order of the
Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Act 1946. It is an independent body
made up of equal numbers of employer and worker representatives appointed by
the Labour Court, with a chair appointed by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise
and Innovation. </p>

<p>Any of the following can apply to the Labour Court to set up a JLC:</p>
<ul><li>The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</li>
  <li>A trade union</li>
  <li>An organisation claiming to represent the workers or employers involved.
  </li>
</ul><h3>The JLC system</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0032/index.html">Industrial
Relations (Amendment) Act 2012</a>, which reformed reforming the Joint Labour
Committees’ wage-setting mechanisms, came into force on 1 August 2012. The
Act provides for the Labour Court to adopt an Employment Regulation Order drawn
up by a JLC. The ERO is then given statutory effect by the Minister for Jobs,
Enterprise and Innovation.</p>

<p>The Act's provisions include:</p>
<ul><li>JLCs have the power to set a basic adult wage rate and 2 additional
    higher rates</li>
  <li>Companies may seek exemption from paying ERO rates due to financial
    difficulty</li>
  <li>JLCs no longer set Sunday premium rates. A new statutory Code of Practice
    on Sunday working is to be prepared by the Workplace Relations
  Commission</li>
  <li>When setting wage rates JLCs will have to take into account factors such
    as competitiveness and rates of employment and unemployment 
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ul><p>There are new EROs for the contract cleaning and security industries – see
below.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l84a61">Joint Labour Committees before July
2011</h2>

<p>Previously some employments were covered by agreements made by Joint Labour
Committees. Following a High Court decision Employment Regulation Orders ceased
to have statutory effect from 7 July 2011. </p>

<p>Employees who were covered by an ERO have existing contracts of employment
which govern their pay and conditions of work. If an employer <a href="../contracts_of_employment/being_asked_to_reduce_your_hours_of_work.html">reduces
an employee’s rate of pay</a> this would be a <a href="../contracts_of_employment/change_job_contract.html">change in their
contract of employment</a> and normally such changes require the employee’s
consent. </p>

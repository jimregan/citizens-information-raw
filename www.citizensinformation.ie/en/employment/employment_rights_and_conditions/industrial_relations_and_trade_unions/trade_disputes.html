<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Most of the law on trade disputes and industrial action is contained in the
Industrial Relations Act 1990. Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0019/sec0008.html#sec8">Section
8</a> of the Act a trade dispute “means any dispute between employers and
workers which is connected with the employment or non-employment, or the terms
or conditions of or affecting the employment, of any person”. An industrial
action is any action which may affect the terms of a contract which is taken by
workers acting together to compel their employer “to accept or not to accept
terms or conditions of or affecting employment.” Examples of industrial
action include a work to rule, a picket, an overtime ban or a strike.</p>

<h3>Trade unions</h3>

<p>Employees have a constitutional right to join a <a href="trade_unions.html">trade union.</a> It can be made a condition of
employment that you must join a particular union upon accepting a job offer and
remain in that union while you remain an employee in that job. There is a view
that this may not be constitutional, but this has not been tested in the courts
yet. If you are already in the job without being a union member and are at a
later stage required to join a union by your employer, you can refuse, as such
a requirement is unconstitutional.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lb8abe">Taking industrial action</h2>

<p>In employment law there is no right to take industrial action but there are
protections for certain workers who do this by, for example, going on strike.
Part 2 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 provides workers, who are taking
part in peaceful industrial action, the following immunities from:</p>
<ol><li>Criminal or civil proceedings for conspiracy to do a particular act if
    the action taken by a person acting alone would not be punishable as a
    crime. Even if you are not a member of a trade union, you benefit from this
    immunity.</li>
  <li>Prosecution when taking part in peaceful picketing. Only members and
    officials of an authorised trade union get the benefit of this immunity</li>
  <li>Prosecution for inducements to break or threats to break contracts of
    employment. Again, only members and officials of an authorised trade union
    get the benefit of this immunity.</li>
</ol><h3>Unfair dismissal</h3>

<p>If you take part in industrial action such as a strike, there is a risk that
you will be dismissed. However, under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1977/en/act/pub/0010/sec0005.html#sec5">section
5</a> of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 the dismissal of an employee for taking
part in a strike or other industrial action is unfair if:</p>
<ul><li>One or more of the other employees taking part in the action were not
    dismissed 
    <p>Or</p>
  </li>
  <li>One or more of the other employees who were dismissed, were later
    reinstated or re-engaged and the employee was not.</li>
</ul><p>This was amended by <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0022/sec0004.html#sec4">section
4</a> of the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act 1993 which extends this
definition of unfair dismissal to include less favourable treatment after
reinstatement or re-engagement after a strike or a lockout.</p>

<p>Lockout is where an employer excludes the employees from work or suspends
work or terminates their employment. In unfair dismissals legislation, a
lockout is considered a dismissal. Again, under Section 5 of the Unfair
Dismissals Act 1977, it is considered an unfair dismissal if an employee is not
reinstated or re-engaged after a lockout and one or more of the other employees
are.</p>

<p>Dismissal for trade union activity or membership is automatically unfair
under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1977/en/act/pub/0010/sec0006.html#sec6">Section
6</a> of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977. An employee dismissed in such
circumstances does not require any particular length of service in the job in
order to enforce his/her rights. The definition of trade union activity is
activity carried out with the employer’s consent or outside working hours.
Strikes or other industrial action are not covered by this definition.</p>

<h3>Victimisation</h3>

<p>The Workplace Relations Commission’s <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Good_Workplace_Relations/codes_practice/COP5/">Code
of Practice on Victimisation</a> refers to victimisation arising from an
employee’s membership or non-membership, activity or non-activity for a trade
union or a manager discharging their managerial functions or any other
employees. It applies to situations where there are no negotiating arrangements
and where collective bargaining has not taken place.</p>

<p>The term <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/victimisation_at_work.html">victimisation</a>
is used to describe unfair treatment of an employee (including a manager). It
does not include dismissal – see ‘Unfair dismissal’ above. If you feel
you have been victimised you can make a complaint to the <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace
Relations Commission</a> under the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act 2004 using the online complaint form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>Other employment issues</h3>

<p><strong>Pay:</strong> Under the Payment of Wages Act 1991, <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/pay_slip.html">deductions
from your pay by your employer</a> are allowed when they arise due to your
being on strike.</p>

<p><strong>Minimum pay:</strong> In the calculation of hourly rate of pay,
‘working hours’ does not include time when you were on strike.</p>

<p><strong>Redundancy:</strong> Time spent on strike does not break the
continuity of service required to qualify for <a href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/redundancy.html">redundancy</a>.
However any time spent on strike during the last 3 years of your employment is
non-reckonable when calculating the statutory redundancy payment.</p>

<p><strong>Public holiday:</strong> You are not entitled to <a href="../leave_and_holidays/public_holidays_in_ireland.html">public holiday
benefits</a> if you have been absent from work immediately before the public
holiday and your absence is due to a strike.</p>

<h3>Social welfare</h3>

<p>If you are on strike, you are not considered unemployed and are not entitled
to Jobseeker's Benefit or Allowance. However you may qualify for credits for
the duration of the strike. Your family may get Supplementary Welfare
Allowance.</p>

<p>You won't normally be eligible for an Exceptional Needs Payment if you are
involved in a trade dispute or on strike. However, a dependent adult or
dependent child of a person on strike can apply.</p>

<p>If you are out of work as a result of a strike (for example, you have been
laid off), you are in a different position. You may qualify for Jobseeker's
Benefit if you are not participating in or directly interested in the trade
dispute which caused the stoppage at work.</p>

<p>In addition to arrangements such as the <a href="../pay_and_employment/pay_inc_min_wage.html">national minimum
wage</a>, some employees are covered by particular agreements that deal with
the pay and working conditions of the employees concerned and may be included
in an employee’s <a shape="rect" href="../contracts_of_employment/contract_of_employment.html">contract of
employment</a>. </p>
<ul><li>The various agreements on pay and conditions made by <a shape="rect" href="joint_labour_committees.html">Joint Labour Committees (JLCs)</a> are
    known as <em>Employment Regulation Orders (EROs)</em>. </li>
  <li>Agreements which result from negotiations between trade unions and
    employers are called <em>collective agreements</em>. </li>
  <li>If a collective agreement relating to the pay or conditions of specified
    workers has been registered with the Labour Court, it is known as a
    <em>registered employment agreement (REA)</em>. </li>
  <li>The Labour Court may recommend that a <em>sectoral employment order
    (SEO)</em> be made for an economic sector on matters of pay, pension or
    sick pay scheme.</li>

<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l9c490">Employment Regulation Orders</h2>

<p>Following a High Court decision, all Employment Regulation Orders ceased to
have statutory effect from 7 July 2011. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0032/index.html">Industrial
Relations (Amendment) Act 2012</a> which reformed the Joint Labour Committees'
wage-setting mechanisms came into force on 1 August 2012. Under the Act, the <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/WR_Bodies/Labour_Court/Labour_Court.html">Labour
Court</a> adopts an Employment Regulation Order (ERO) drawn up by a Joint
Labour Committee. The ERO is given statutory effect by the Minister for Jobs,
Enterprise and Innovation. </p>

<p>There are new EROs for the contract cleaning and security industries – see
below.</p>
</div>

<p>The list of Joint Labour Committees is as follows: </p>
<ul><li>Agricultural workers </li>
  <li>Catering (Dublin and Dún Laoghaire) </li>
  <li>Catering (Other) </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/SI-548-of-2016-Contract-Cleaning.pdf">Contract
    cleaning </a></li>
  <li>Hairdressing </li>
  <li>Hotels (Other excluding Cork) </li>
  <li>Retail, grocery, and allied trades </li>

    industry</a> </li>
</ul><div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="lc25bc">REAs and sectoral employment
orders</h2>

<p>Following a decision of the Supreme Court, all registered employment
agreements ceased to have statutory effect from 9 May 2013.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/27/enacted/en/html">Industrial
Relations (Amendment) Act 2015</a> provides for a system of registered
employment agreements and sectoral employment orders. Registered employment
agreements (REAs) are collective agreements that relate to the pay or
conditions of employment of specified workers and that are registered with the
Labour Court.</p>

<p>Following a request from a trade union or employers’ organisation, the
Labour Court may make a recommendation to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and
Innovation to make a sectoral employment order (SEO). Under the 2015 Act, an
SEO may set out minimum pay rates as well as pension and sick pay schemes for
an economic sector. <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/27/section/13/enacted/en/html#sec13">Section
13</a> of the Act defines an economic sector as a “sector of the economy
concerned with a specific economic activity requiring specific qualifications,
skills or knowledge”</p>

<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l02ba3">Pre-2011 EROs and pre-2013 REAs</h2>

<p>Following a High Court decision, all Employment Regulation Orders ceased to
have statutory effect from 7 July 2011. Following a decision of the Supreme
Court, all registered employment agreements ceased to have statutory effect
from 9 May 2013. </p>

<p>Employees who were previously covered by an ERO or an REA have existing
contracts of employment which govern their pay and conditions of work. If an
employer <a href="../contracts_of_employment/being_asked_to_reduce_your_hours_of_work.html">reduces
an employee’s rate of pay</a> this would be a <a href="../contracts_of_employment/change_job_contract.html">change in their
contract of employment</a> and normally such changes require the employee’s
consent. </p>

<p>You can view the last rates of pay and employment conditions contained in
the REAs up to 9 May 2013 for the following sectors: </p>

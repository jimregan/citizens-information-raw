<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Employees have a right set down in the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/irish_constitution_1/constitution_introduction.html">Constitution</a>
to join a trade union. A trade union can provide an important source of
information and protection in relation to employment matters, as well as
negotiating with the employer for better pay and conditions. </p>

<p>There is no legal obligation on an employer to negotiate with a union on
behalf of an employee member, unless previously agreed. This does not prevent a
dispute about trade union recognition from being a lawful dispute. </p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ictu.ie/">Irish Congress of Trade
Unions (ICTU)</a> is the single umbrella organisation for trade unions,
representing a range of interests of employees, both in Ireland and in Northern
Ireland. ICTU also run the website <a shape="rect" href="http://www.unionconnect.ie">unionconnect.ie</a> to facilitate people to
join a union.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>It can be made a condition of employment that you must join a particular
union upon accepting a job offer and remain in that union while you remain an
employee in that job. There is a view that this may not be constitutional, but
this has not been tested in the courts yet. If you are already in the job
without being a union member and are at a later stage required to join a union
by your employer, you can refuse, as this is unconstitutional. </p>

<p>Dismissal for trade union activity or membership is automatically unfair and
an employee dismissed in such circumstances does not require any particular
length of service in the job in order to enforce his/her rights. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The rate of subscription paid to your trade union will be determined by the
trade union but is usually at the rate of 0.5% to 1% of your gross salary per
year. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you have been dismissed from your employment for trade union activity,
this is automatically unfair under the <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">Unfair
Dismissals Acts 1977-2015.</a> You <span>do not require any particular length
of service</span> as an employee, to bring a case in this instance under the
law. You can bring your case to the <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace
Relations Commission</a> using the online complaint form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.</p>

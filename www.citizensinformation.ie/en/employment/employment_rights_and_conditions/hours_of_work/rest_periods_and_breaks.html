<p>All workers are entitled to have breaks while they are at work and rest
periods between working days or nights. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/index.html">Organisation
of Working Time Act 1997</a> sets out the statutory minimum entitlement for
employees as regards <a shape="rect" href="working_week.html">working
hours,</a> <a shape="rect" href="../leave_and_holidays/annual_leave_public_holidays.html">annual
leave</a>, <a shape="rect" href="night_work.html">night work,</a> breaks and
rest periods for employees. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Breaks</h3>

<p>The general rule on breaks is that you are entitled to a break of 15 minutes
after a 4 ½ hour work period. If you work more than 6 hours you are entitled
to a break of 30 minutes, which can include the first 15-minute break. There is
no entitlement to be paid during these breaks and they are not considered part
of working time.</p>

<p>Shop employees who work more than 6 hours and whose hours of work include
11.30am–2.30pm are entitled to a one-hour consecutive break which must occur
during those hours. </p>

<p><strong>Example: </strong>If you start work at 7am you are entitled to take
a 15-minute break at 11.30am. At 1.15pm when you have worked 6 hours you are
entitled to take a break of 30 minutes. As you have already taken a break at
11.15, your employer can limit this break to 15 minutes. (If you are working in
a shop you are entitled to a one-hour break at 1.15pm.) If you start working
again at 1.30pm or 1.45pm and continue working until 6 or 6.15pm you are
entitled to another 15-minute break.</p>

<p>Employees whose working conditions are covered by the <a href="http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Registered_Employment_Agreements/Drapery_Footwear_Allied_Trades_Dublin_Dun_Laoghaire_.html">Registered
Employment Agreement (Dublin and Dun Laoghaire Drapery, Footwear And Allied
Trades)</a> are entitled to a 15-minute paid break (exclusive of the main meal
break) if working more than 4 ½ hours.</p>

<p>Until 7 July 2011 employees who were covered by the Employment Regulation
Order (ERO) for the Retail Grocery and Allied Trades (nationwide) were entitled
to a 15-minute paid break (exclusive of the main meal break) if working more
than 4 ½ hours. <a href="../industrial_relations_and_trade_unions/employment_regulation_orders_and_registered_employment_agreements.html">Following
a High Court decision Employment Regulation Orders ceased to have statutory
effect from 7 July 2011.</a> Employees who were covered by this ERO have
existing contracts of employment which govern their conditions of work. Any
change in their contract of employment normally requires the employee’s
consent so the terms set down in the ERO still apply to employees whose
contracts date from before 7 July 2011. Until new EROs are made the conditions
of work (including rest periods) for employees who start work after 7 July 2011
are governed by employment legislation such as the Organisation of Working Time
Act 1997.</p>

<h3>Rest periods</h3>

<p>The definition of a rest period is any time that is not working time. The
rest periods set out in the Act are as follows:</p>

<p>(a) You are entitled to 11 consecutive hours rest in any period of 24 hours.
In addition you should get 24 consecutive hours rest in any period of 7 days
and this should normally follow on from one of the 11-hour rest periods already
mentioned, or</p>

<p>(b) As an alternative your employer can give you two 24-hour rest periods in
the week that follows one in which you did not get the entitlement described in
(a) above.</p>

<p>Unless your contract provides otherwise your 24-hour rest period referred to
above should include a Sunday. </p>

<h3>Who is not covered by the Act</h3>

<p>The provisions of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 on breaks and
rest periods do not apply to all employees. They do not apply to the Gardaí,
Defence Forces, employees who control their own working hours or family
employees on farms or in private homes. The <a shape="rect" href="../../starting_work_and_changing_job/young_people_at_work/hours_of_work_for_young_people.html">working
hours of young people under the age of 18</a> are regulated by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0016/index.html">Protection
of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996</a>.</p>

<h3>Exemptions <br></h3>

<p>In the following situations employers can be exempted from providing the
rest periods as set out in the Act. These exemptions are allowed provided the
employee is given equivalent compensatory rest. This means that if a rest
period is postponed the employee must be allowed to take it within a reasonable
period of time.The Workplace Relations Commission has a <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Good_Workplace_Relations/codes_practice/COP8/">Code
of Practice on Compensatory Rest Periods </a></p>

<p><strong>Exceptional circumstances:</strong> an employer is exempt from
providing these rest periods if this is not possible due to exceptional
circumstances or emergency. </p>

<p><strong>Collective agreement:</strong> The rest periods set out in the Act
may be varied if there is a collective agreement to vary them which has been
approved by the Labour Court or if there is an <a shape="rect" href="../industrial_relations_and_trade_unions/employment_regulation_orders_and_registered_employment_agreements.html">Employment
Regulation Order or Registered Employment Agreement.</a></p>

<p><strong>Shift work:</strong> When shift workers are changing shift or are
working split shifts there is an exemption from the requirement to have the
rest periods as specified in the Act.</p>

<p>However, the regulations governing those employed in transport activities <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/si/0020.html">(SI
20/1998)</a> and in certain categories of civil protection services <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/si/0052.html">(SI
52/1998)</a> exempt them from the provisions on statutory rest breaks/periods
but do not require them to have equivalent compensatory rest.</p>

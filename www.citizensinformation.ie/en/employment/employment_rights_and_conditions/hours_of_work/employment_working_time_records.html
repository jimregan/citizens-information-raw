<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/si/0473.html">Organisation of
Working Time (Records) (Prescribed Form and Exemptions) Regulations 2001</a>
requires all employers to keep detailed records of start and finishing times,
<a shape="rect" href="working_week.html">hours worked each day </a>and each
week and <a shape="rect" href="../leave_and_holidays/">leave</a> granted to
employees. This legislation is part of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/index.html">Organisation
of Working Time Act 1997</a>. The employer must keep these records for 3
years.</p>

<p>Where there is no method of electronically recording hours worked by
employees (that is, a clock-in system), the employer must record the days and
hours worked each week using form OWT1 or in a form substantially similar to
this – see 'How to apply' below.</p>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/print.html#sec8">Section
8</a> of the Act, an <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/national_employment_rights_authority.html">inspector
from the Workplace Relations Commission</a> has the power to get full access to
these records.</p>

<p>Employers who fail to keep records under these Regulations are guilty of an
offence and are liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €1,900.
</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l4461f">Records to be kept</h2>

<p>The records that must be kept should include the following: </p>
<ul><li>Name and address of each employee, their <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">PPS
    number</a> and a brief statement of their duties as an employee </li>
  <li>A copy of the statement provided to each employee under the <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1994_0005.htm">Terms
    of Employment (Information) Act 1994–2014</a> </li>
  <li>Days and total hours worked in each week by each employee concerned </li>
  <li>Any days and hours of leave in each week granted by way of annual leave
    or in respect of a public holiday to each employee and the payment made to
    each employee in respect of that leave </li>
  <li>Any additional day's pay in respect of a public holiday provided in each
    week to each employee concerned and </li>
  <li>A copy of a written record of a notification of working time issued to an
    employee as provided for in <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/20/section/17/enacted/en/html">Section
    17</a> of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997. </li>
</ul><p>The records kept by an employer must be presented in a format that can be
easily understood by an inspector.</p>

<p>In addition to this obligation, where an employer and employee agree, an
employee may complete form OWT1 or a substantially similar form each week and
present the completed form to the employer for counter-signature. The employer
then keeps the completed form for inspection. The form should be made available
at all reasonable times for examination by an inspector. </p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l4f489">Exemptions</h2>

<p>Under the Regulations, the following employers are exempt from recording
details of <a href="rest_periods_and_breaks.html">rest breaks and rest
periods</a> of employees: </p>
<ul><li>Employers who have electronic record-keeping facilities (such as a
    flexi-clock or clock in facilities) and </li>
  <li>Employers who have manual as opposed to electronic record-keeping
    facilities and who are required to keep records (using form OWT1 or a
    substantially similar form). </li>
</ul><p>Employers will not have to keep records of rest breaks if they comply with
the following: </p>
<ul><li>Each worker receives notification from the employer (in writing) of rest
    breaks and periods referred to in Sections 11, 12 and 13 of the Act or,
  </li>
  <li>If Sections 11, 12 and 13 of the Act do not apply to you (that is, you
    are part of a collective agreement, a <a shape="rect" href="../industrial_relations_and_trade_unions/employment_regulation_orders_and_registered_employment_agreements.html">registered
    employment agreement or an employment regulation order</a> which have
    already set down specific rest breaks and periods) your employer must
    notify you of the terms of your collective agreement, registered employment
    agreement or employment regulation order and, in particular, will not have
    to record rest breaks and periods. </li>
  <li>Your employer puts in place and notifies (in writing) each employee of
    procedures whereby an employee may notify in writing the employer of any
    rest period or break referred to in Sections 11, 12, 13 of the Act to which
    the employee is entitled and was unable to take on a particular occasion.
    The employee must also state the reason for not availing of such rest
    breaks or periods. </li>
</ul><p>Your employer must keep: </p>
<ul><li>Evidence that they have informed each worker (in writing) of rest breaks
  </li>
  <li>Evidence that they have informed each worker (in writing) that rest
    breaks that are not taken must be notified to the employer </li>
  <li>Records of all notifications sent to the employer by the worker regarding
    the Organisation of Working Time. </li>
</ul><p>If you are unable to take a rest break in your job, you must notify your
employer in writing (within 1 week) that you were unable to take this break.
When you notify your employer that you were unable to take your break, your
employer must look at the reasons why you were unable to take your break and at
any health and safety issues that might or have arisen relating to you and your
job. As soon as possible, your employer must allow you take the rest break that
you were due. If you do not take your break when this is offered, you are at
fault and your employer is not obliged to offer you a further rest break.</p>

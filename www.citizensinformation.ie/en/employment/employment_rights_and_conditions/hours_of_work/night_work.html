<p>The working hours of night workers are regulated by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/index.html">Organisation
of Working Time Act 1997</a>. It is important to be clear about what is meant
by <em>night work</em> and <em>night worker.</em> Night work means work done in
the period between midnight and 7am. A night worker is an employee who normally
works at least 3 hours between midnight and 7am and who works at night for at
least half of their working hours in a year.</p>

<h3>Night workers' hours of work</h3>

<p>In general the <a shape="rect" href="working_week.html">maximum average
working week</a> is 48 hours. Normally, a night worker should not work more
than an average of 8 hours in a 24-hour period. The average is calculated over
either a 2-month period or a longer period if it is part of a collective
agreement. </p>

<p>If the night work involves special hazards or physical or mental strain,
then working hours cannot exceed 8 hours in a 24-hour period. The employer is
required to carry out a risk assessment in order to determine whether the night
work involves special hazards, or physical or mental strain. </p>

<p>Pay rates and leave for night workers are not covered by the Organisation of
Working Time Act. These depend on the terms of the night worker's contract of
employment.</p>

<p>In general the law regulating the <a shape="rect" href="../../starting_work_and_changing_job/young_people_at_work/hours_of_work_for_young_people.html">working
hours of young people</a> does not permit young people to do night work. </p>

<h3>Health and safety</h3>

<p>Part 6 of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/si/0299.html">Safety, Health and
Welfare (General Application) Regulations 2007</a> states the steps an employer
must take to ensure the health and safety of night workers. Before employing a
person to do night work and at regular intervals while an employee is a night
worker, an employer is required to make available an assessment of the effects,
if any, on the health of the employee. This assessment must be made available,
free of charge, to the employee. Alternatively, if the employee is entitled to
have the assessment carried out by the State free of charge, the employer must
make arrangements to allow the employee to access this entitlement.</p>

<p>If a night worker becomes ill as a result of night work, the employer
should, whenever possible, assign duties to the employee that do not involve
night work and which are suited to that employee.</p>
</div>
If an employee is pregnant and a quarter of her working hours are night work,
she may exempted from doing night work if a doctor certifies it may affect her
health and safety and that of her baby. If there is no suitable alternative
work she may be given <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Workplace_Health/Sensitive_Risk_Groups/Pregnant_at_Work_FAQ_Responses/Pregnant_at_Work_FAQ_Responses.html#hsl2">health
and safety leave.</a> This also applies for up to 14 weeks after the birth of
her child.

<p>Disputes under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 or the Maternity
Protection Acts should be referred by making a complaint within 6 months of the
dispute occurring. You must use the online complaint form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.
However this time limit may be extended for up to 12 months if there was
reasonable cause for not bringing the complaint within the first 6 months. </p>

<p>The Health and Safety Authority has published a booklet, <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Publications_and_Forms/Publications/Healthcare_Sector/Night_and_Shift_Work_2012.pdf">Guidance
for Employers and Employees on Night and Shift Work (pdf)</a>.</p>

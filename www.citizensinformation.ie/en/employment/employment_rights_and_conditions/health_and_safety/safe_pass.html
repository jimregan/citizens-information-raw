<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Safe Pass is a safety awareness training programme for construction workers.
It is a one-day programme to enable them to work on construction sites without
being a risk to themselves or others. Employers are required by law to ensure
that employees on construction sites carry Safe Pass cards. As a result,
employers must ensure that all employees are properly trained. </p>

<p>The Safe Pass programme is operated and managed by SOLAS and aims to:</p>
<ul><li>Raise the standard of safety awareness in the construction industry </li>
  <li>Ensure that all construction site workers undergo basic health and safety
    awareness training with the view to making a positive contribution to the
    prevention of accidents and avoidance of health hazards </li>
  <li>Maintain a register of construction site and local authority workers who
    have received such health and safety training </li>
  <li>Provide all Safe Pass participants with a Safe Pass registration card
    that will indicate that the holders have attended a formal course in health
    and safety awareness </li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>All workers in the construction sector, including apprentices, trainees and
on-site security workers, must have received safety awareness training and have
a Safe Pass registration card before they can work on construction sites.</p>

<p>Every contractor (or other person working on their behalf) is required by
law to ensure that everyone under their direct control on a construction site
has received Safe Pass training and has been issued with a current Safe Pass
registration card. Under <a href="health_safety_work.html">health and safety
legislation</a>, employers are required to allow their employees paid time off
from work to attend safety awareness training.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Your_Industry/Construction/Construction_FAQ's/Safe_Pass/">FAQs
about the Safe Pass programme</a> on the Health and Safety Authority website.
</p>

<h3>Safe Pass registration cards</h3>

<p>You will be issued with a Safe Pass registration card once you successfully
complete the one-day Safe Pass training programme. This card lasts for 4 years
from the date of the training course. If you later leave the workplace, you can
still keep your registration card, provided it is in date. When it expires, you
must then attend a further Safe Pass training course.</p>

<p>It is illegal to forge or alter a registration card or to make any other
card that resembles a registration card. All of the personal details on your
registration card must be accurate and it is illegal for you to provide false
information to SOLAS.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lb74ce">Paying for the course</h2>

<p>Generally the employer pays for the Safe Pass course. Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2005/act/10/enacted/en/print">Safety,
Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005</a>, the employer must allow employees
time off from their duties for awareness training as may be reasonable having
regard to their health and safety without loss of pay.</p>

<p>Your employer cannot require you to reimburse them for the cost of the
course if you subsequently leave your job, (unless you have signed something in
your contract of employment stating you will reimburse any training fees
incurred before you have given a certain period of service).</p>

<p>If you are currently <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/losing_your_job/">unemployed,</a> have
got a job on a construction site but are required to have a Safe Pass Card
before you start work, your local employment services office may be able to
help with the fee. </p>

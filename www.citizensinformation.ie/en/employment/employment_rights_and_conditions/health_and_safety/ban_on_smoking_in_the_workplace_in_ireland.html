<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p><span>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2002/act/6/enacted/en/html">Public
Health (Tobacco) Acts 2002-2015</a>, smoking is forbidden</span> in enclosed
places of work. This includes office blocks, various buildings, public
houses/bars, restaurants and company vehicles (cars and vans). </p>

<p>There is also a limit on the sale of cigarettes. It is no longer possible to
buy a pack of 10 cigarettes. You may only buy packs of 20 cigarettes. </p>

<p>The purpose of this ban is to offer protection to employees and the public
who are exposed to the harmful and toxic effects of tobacco smoke in the
workplace. Smoking has been identified as a major cause of heart disease and a
significant contributor to lung cancer. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You are not allowed to smoke in an enclosed place of work. While the ban
means that smoking is forbidden in many places, there are a few exceptions: </p>
<ul><li><a href="../../../justice/prison_system/prisons_and_places_of_detention.html">Prisons</a>
  </li>
  <li>Police station detention areas </li>
  <li>Nursing homes </li>
  <li>Hospices </li>
  <li>Religious order homes </li>
  <li>The Central Mental Hospital </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/health/mental_health/admission_to_a_psychiatric_hospital.html">Psychiatric
    hospitals</a> </li>
  <li>Hotel, guesthouse and B and B bedrooms </li>
  <li>Third-level educational residential facilities. </li>
</ul><p>Even though certain places are exempt from the ban, <span>all
employers</span> (even those who are exempt) <span>still have the right</span>
to <span>enforce the legislation</span>. In other words, even though the above
organisations and institutions are not obliged to enforce the ban, they are
free to do so if they wish. </p>

<p>Every employer is obliged to protect the health of staff, customers,
residents and visitors to their premises. In the case of <span>exempted
buildings only</span>, this means that employers can, if they wish, designate
certain areas of their premises as <em>smoking</em> or <em>non-smoking</em> in
order to minimise risk. This means, for example, that even though a nursing
home is exempt from the smoking ban, the owners of the nursing home could order
that residents may only smoke outside or in a designated smoking room. </p>

<p>Given that prisons and places of detention are unique, the law does not
apply to these institutions. Again, however, there is nothing to stop prison
authorities from designating these institutions as entirely non-smoking or
establish designated smoking rooms if they wish.</p>

<h3>Outdoor smoking areas</h3>

<p>While smoking in an enclosed workplace is forbidden, employers have
discretion to provide an outdoor smoking area, subject to the requirements of
the law. </p>

<p>The law has defined an outdoor area as: </p>
<ul><li>A place or premises, or part of a place or premises, that is wholly
    uncovered by any roof, fixed or mobile. </li>
  <li>An outdoor place or premises that is covered by a roof, so long as not
    more than 50% of the perimeter (outside) is covered by a wall, windows,
    gate or similar. </li>
</ul><h3>Common areas of buildings</h3>

<p>The smoking ban also applies to <em>common areas</em> within buildings. This
means, for example, that corridors, lobby areas and reception areas of
buildings such as apartment blocks and hotels are also covered. </p>

<p>If you wish to make a complaint about smoking in a common area of an
apartment block, you should first contact the management company or residents'
association of the apartment block and try to reach an agreeable solution. If
you wish to make a complaint about smoking in a hotel common area, you should
first make your complaint to the hotel management. Remember, it <span>is an
offence</span> to smoke in an area that has been designated
<span>non-smoking</span>. </p>

<p>If your complaint about smoking in a common area of a building has not been
resolved, you should contact your local Environmental Health Officer â€“ see
'Where to apply' below.</p>

<h3>Does my employer have to give me time off work for smoking breaks?</h3>

<p>No. Employees are only entitled to <a shape="rect" href="../hours_of_work/working_week.html">time off work for breaks</a> as set
down in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/sec0012.html#zza20y1997s12">Section
12 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997</a>. Your employer is <span>not
obliged</span> to provide smoking breaks for employees. </p>

<h3>Enforcement of the smoking ban</h3>

<p>Inspections to ensure that the ban is being implemented are undertaken by
Environmental Health Officers employed by the <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/how_health_is_organised/health_boards.html">Health Service
Executive (HSE)</a>. In addition, inspections are carried out by inspectors
from the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/">Health and Safety
Authority</a>. The workplace locations visited by the Health and Safety
Authority must comply with the smoke-free measures as part of their general
compliance with health and safety requirements. </p>

<p>Officers from the HSE work to ensure that smoke-free measures are
implemented in workplaces connected with the food and hospitality sector. </p>

<h3>Offences</h3>

<p>Any person found guilty of breaching the ban on smoking in the workplace may
be subject to a <a href="../../../justice/criminal_law/criminal_trial/maximum_fines_on_summary_conviction.html">Class
B fine</a>. The owner, manager or person in charge of the workplace is legally
responsible for ensuring that the ban on smoking in the workplace is complied
with. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you have an accident while at work or on your way to work, you need to
find out what you should do. If necessary, you should seek medical help from
your local general practitioner (GP/family doctor) or hospital. You should
report the accident to your employer. Then you may need to check if there are
any benefits or entitlements that you may be eligible for while you are out of
work and what to expect when you return to work.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0010/index.html">Safety,
Health and Welfare at Work Acts 2005 and 2010</a> set out the rights and
obligations of both employers and employees and provides for substantial fines
and penalties for breaches of the health and safety legislation. You can read
more in our document on <a href="health_safety_work.html">health and safety
at work</a>.</p>

<h3>Reporting of accidents</h3>

<p>You should report an accident while on your way to work or while at work to
your employer.</p>

<p>An employer must report any accidents to the <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/">Health and Safety Authority</a> when an employee
is missing 3 consecutive days at work (not including the day of the
accident).</p>

<h3>Sick leave and sick pay</h3>

<p>You should check if you have an entitlement to <a href="../leave_and_holidays/sick_leave.html">paid sick leave</a> in the
terms and conditions of your <a href="../contracts_of_employment/contract_of_employment.html">contract of
employment</a>. In general, an employee has no right under employment law to be
paid while on sick leave.</p>

<h3>Social welfare payments</h3>

<p>There are a number of benefits which you may entitled to while you are out
sick.</p>

<h4>Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme</h4>

<p>The <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/occupational_injuries_benefit_overview.html">Occupational
Injuries Benefit</a> Scheme is a group of benefits for people injured or
incapacitated by an accident at work or while travelling directly to or from
work.</p>

<p><a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/injury_benefit.html">Injury
Benefit</a> is a weekly payment made to you if you are unfit for work due to an
accident at work or an accident while travelling (on an unbroken journey)
directly to or from work.</p>

<p>Under the <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/medical_care_scheme.html">Medical
Care Scheme</a> you can claim certain medical costs that are not paid by the
Health Service Executive (HSE) or covered by Treatment Benefit Scheme.</p>

<p><a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disablement_benefit.html">Disablement
Benefit</a> can be paid to you if you suffer a loss of physical or mental
faculty because of an accident at work, an accident travelling directly to or
from work, or a prescribed disease contracted at work.</p>

<p>You can find out more about these and other payments under the scheme in <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/occupational_injuries_benefit_overview.html">our
document on the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme</a>.</p>

<h4>Other payments</h4>

<p>You may get <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Publications/SW119/Pages/1WhatisIllnessBenefit.aspx">Illness
Benefit</a> from the Department of Social Protection if you cannot work because
you are sick or ill. You must be aged under 66, covered by the appropriate
class of <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social
insurance (PRSI)</a> and satisfy the PRSI conditions.</p>

<p>If you do not have enough PRSI contributions, you may qualify for <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability
Allowance</a> which is a means-tested payment. You may qualify if you have an
injury, disease or physical or mental disability that has continued or may be
expected to continue for at least one year.</p>

<p>If you don’t qualify for Illness Benefit or Disability Allowance, you may
be entitled to the basic <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary
Welfare Allowance</a>. If you have returned to work you can claim the basic
Supplementary Welfare Allowance for up to 30 days while you are waiting for
your wages.</p>

<h4>PRSI and tax</h4>

<p>If you are out of work you may qualify for a <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">credited
contribution</a>. A credited social insurance contribution is a contribution
given to you and recorded on your social insurance record. Credit contributions
are important because you may use them to help you qualify for a social
insurance payment.</p>

<p>You may also get a <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/tax_refund_when_unemployed_or_out_of_work_sick.html">tax
refund</a> if you are out of work due to illness. This will depend on the
length of time you have been unemployed, the amount of tax you have paid, the
amount of tax credits you have used and the amount of your weekly social
welfare payment.</p>

<h3>Employers’ liability insurance</h3>

<p>Your employer may have taken out employers’ liability insurance cover.
This cover enables employers to meet the cost of compensation for their
employee’s injuries or illness which occur while their employees are
working.</p>

<h3>Personal injury claim</h3>

<p>You cannot seek compensation from your employer under the health and safety
legislation but you can make a personal injury claim through <a href="../../../justice/civil_law/personal_injuries_assessment_board.html">InjuriesBoard.ie</a>.
If either you or your employer rejects the assessment the Board will issue you
with an authorisation allowing you to make a <a href="../../../justice/civil_law/taking_a_civil_case_intro.html">claim
through the civil courts</a>.</p>

<h3>Returning to work</h3>

<p>Your employer may have a sick leave and return to work policy to support a
safe return for the employee who has had an illness or injury. In terms of
medical evidence you may be required to attend your employer's medical
expert.</p>

<p>If you become disabled through an accident or illness, your disability may
require that your workplace be adapted or you may need special equipment in
order to perform your job. You can read more in our document on <a href="../../employment_and_disability/working_with_a_disability.html">working
with a disability</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Dismissal:</strong> If you are dismissed from your employment while
on long-term certified sick leave, you may, under certain conditions, bring a
claim for <a href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfair
dismissal</a> against your employer. If your illness is considered to be a
disability under <a href="http://www.ihrec.ie/publications/list/ihrec-employment-equality-rights-explained/">employment
equality legislation</a>, your rights under that particular legislation would
also have to be taken into consideration.</p>

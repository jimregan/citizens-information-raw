<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l07de2">Introduction </h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0019/index.html">Carer's
Leave Act 2001</a> allows employees to leave their employment temporarily to
provide full-time care for someone in need of full-time care and attention. You
are entitled to take carer’s leave of at least 13 weeks up to a maximum of
104 weeks. If you ask to take less than 13 weeks’ carer’s leave, your
employer may refuse your request – see ‘Taking carer’s leave’ below.
</p>

<p>Carer's leave from employment is unpaid but the Carer’s Leave Act ensures
that those who propose to avail of carer's leave will have their jobs kept open
for them for the duration of the leave. You may be eligible for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/carers/carers_benefit.html">Carer's
Benefit</a> if you have enough PRSI contributions. If you do not qualify for
Carer's Benefit you may qualify for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/carers/carers_allowance.html">Carer's
Allowance</a> which is a means-tested payment. You can take carer's leave even
if you do not qualify for either of these payments.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You must have worked for your employer for a continuous period of 12 months
to be eligible for carer's leave. </p>

<p>The person you are proposing to care for, must be deemed to be in need of
full-time care and attention by a deciding officer of the Department of Social
Protection. The decision by the Department is reached on the basis of
information provided by the family doctor (GP) of the person whom you will be
caring for. The person you propose to care for must be so disabled as to
require: </p>
<ul><li>Continuous supervison and frequent assistance throughout the day in
    connection with their normal personal needs for example, help to eat,
    drink, wash or dress, <strong>or</strong> </li>
  <li>Continuous supervision in order to avoid danger to themselves </li>
</ul><p>The person you will be caring for does not need to be a family member or
spouse, but could be a friend or colleague. </p>

<h3>Taking carer’s leave </h3>

<p>You may apply to take carer's leave in one continuous period of 104 weeks or
for a number of periods not exceeding a total of 104 weeks. If you do not take
carer's leave in one continuous period, there must be a gap of at least 6 weeks
between the periods of carer’s leave. You must give your employer at least 6
week's notice of your intention to take carer's leave - see 'How to apply'
below.</p>

<p>The minimum statutory entitlement to carer's leave is 13 weeks. If you apply
for a period of carer's leave which is less than 13 weeks’ duration, your
employer may refuse (on reasonable grounds) to allow you to take less than 13
weeks' carer's leave. Where your employer refuses this leave, he or she must
specify in writing to you the grounds for refusing you this leave. </p>

<p>However, you and your employer may agree arrangements for carer's leave
which are more favourable to you.</p>

<p>You may only be on carer's leave in respect of any one person in need of
full-time care at any one time. An exception is where 2 people live together
and both are in need of full-time care and attention. In this situation the
total amount of carer's leave is 208 weeks (104 for each person being cared
for). </p>

<p>If your carer's leave to care for someone has terminated, you cannot
commence another period of carer's leave to care for a different person until a
period of 6 months has elapsed since the termination of the previous period of
carer's leave.</p>

<h3>Confirmation of carer's leave from employment </h3>

<p>If you have successfully applied for carer's leave from employment, no less
than 2 weeks before you intend to commence carer's leave, you and your employer
must prepare and sign a document specifying or confirming this arrangement. The
document must include some important information, for example, the date when
you wish to commence carer's leave, the duration of your carer's leave, and the
form in which your leave will be taken. You can find a sample confirmation
document in Appendix B of the <a href="http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Guide_to_the_Carers_Leave_Act.pdf">Carer's
Leave Act explanatory booklet (pdf)</a>. Your employer signs and retains this
document and must give you a copy of it so you can have a record of this
arrangement. </p>

<h3>Working while on carer’s leave </h3>

<p>You may work while you are on carer’s leave for up to 15 hours a week
provided your income from employment or self-employment is less than a weekly
income limit set by the Department of Social Protection (DSP). You should
contact the Carer's Benefit Section of the DSP for details of the income limit
- see 'Where to apply' below. Alternatively you may attend an educational or
training course or take up voluntary work for a maximum of 15 hours a week. </p>

<p>Before you start work or training you should inform the Department of Social
Protection. </p>

<h3>Your social insurance (PRSI) record <br></h3>

<p>If you are getting Carer's Benefit or Carer's Allowance, you will get <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">credited
social insurance contributions or credits.</a> If you are on carer's leave but
do not get Carer's Benefit or Carer's Allowance, you are still entitled to get
credits. You should get your employer complete the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Forms/Documents/carl_credits.pdf">application
form for carer's leave credits (pdf).</a> This will make sure that your
existing cover for social welfare is fully maintained.</p>

<h3>Postponing, curtailing or terminating your carer's leave </h3>

<p>The document you agree and sign with your employer confirming you will be
taking carer's leave is flexible. This means that your arrangement to take
carer's leave can be amended. Even if your leave from employment has already
commenced, provided that you and your employer agree, your carer’s leave (or
part of it) may be postponed, curtailed or varied as to how it is taken. Then
your confirmation of carer’s leave agreement can be amended and signed off by
both of you again. Your employer should keep the original copy of the amended
agreement and you must be given a copy of this amendment for your own records.
</p>

<p>Details about circumstances in which carer's leave may be terminated is
available in 'Further information' below.</p>

<h3>Returning to work </h3>

<p>If you are on carer’s leave, you must give notice in writing to your
employer 4 weeks before the date you will return to work, that you intend to
return to work. </p>

<h3>Employment rights</h3>

<p>As regards your employment conditions, generally you are to be treated as if
you had been in work during your period of carer’s leave except that you are
not entitled to pay. You are only entitled to annual leave and public holidays
in respect of the first 13 weeks of carer’s leave. </p>

<p>You may not be dismissed for exercising your right to carer's leave. You are
protected against being <a shape="rect" href="../../enforcement_and_redress/victimisation_at_work.html">victimised</a>
for taking carer's leave or proposing to take it. This means that your employer
may not penalise you by dismissal, unfair treatment including selection for
redundancy or an unfavourable change in your conditions of employment. </p>

<h3>Unpaid leave from employment (outside of carer's leave) <br></h3>

<p>If you wish to avail of unpaid leave from employment for less than the 13
week minimum set down by the Carer's Leave Act, it is possible to agree this
with your employer. You and your employer must agree this in writing, clearly
stating the date when you will commence this leave and when you will return
from leave. You will need to get in touch with PRSI records section in the
Department of Social Protection to ensure that your social insurance record is
preserved during this leave - see 'Where to apply' below. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>The family doctor (GP) of the individual you propose to care for will need
to complete part of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Forms/Documents/carb1.pdf">application form for
Carer's Benefit (pdf)</a> unless the individual is under 16 and Domiciliary
Carer's Allowance is being paid for that person. Your employer will also need
to fill in part of this form to confirm that you are an employee, giving
details such as when you commenced employment.</p>

<p>The completed application form should then be forwarded to the Carer's
Benefit Section at the Department of Social Protection. The Department will
then make a decision on the advice of the family doctor as to whether or not
this individual requires full-time care and attention. The Department will also
assess any eligibility you may have regarding Carer's Benefit. </p>

<p>Not less than 6 weeks before you propose to take carer’s leave from
employment, you must make a formal application to your employer for this leave.
In exceptional or emergency situations where it is not reasonably practicable
to give 6 weeks' notice, you should give notice as soon as it is reasonably
possible. You must provide your application for carer's leave in writing to
your employer stating: </p>
<ul><li>That you propose to take carer's leave under the Carer's Leave Act 2001
    commencing on a specific date </li>
  <li>The way in which you intend to take this leave (that is, in one
    continuous block, or in a series of blocks over a period) </li>
  <li>That you have made an application to the Department of Social Protection
    for a decision by a deciding officer under the Act that the person in
    respect of whom you propose to avail of carer's leave in order to provide
    full-time care, requires this care </li>
</ul><p>You can find a sample notice of intention form in Appendix A of the <a href="http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Guide_to_the_Carers_Leave_Act.pdf">Carer's
Leave Act explanatory booklet (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>At least 2 weeks before your carer's leave is due to start you and your
employer must sign the confirmation document - see 'Confirmation of carer's
leave from employment' above. </p>

<p>Disputes with your employer under the Carer's Leave Act 2001 should be
referred to the Workplace Relations Commission within 6 months of the dispute
occurring. You must use the online complaint form available on <a href="http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Referring-a-Dispute/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.
The time limit may be extended for up to a further 6 months, but only where
there is a reasonable cause which prevented the complaint being brought within
the normal time limit. Disputes arising from the dismissal of an employee in
relation to carer's leave are dealt with under the <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfair
dismissals legislation.</a></p>

<p>Information about your employment rights and the Carer’s Leave Act 2001 is

<h3>Termination of carer's leave</h3>

<p>Carer's leave usually ends on the date set out in the confirmation<br>
document. The leave may also end in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul><li>At a date agreed between the employer and the employee </li>
  <li>Where the person being cared for no longer needs full-time care<br>
    and attention </li>
  <li>Where the employee is no longer in a position to provide full-time<br>
    care and attention </li>
  <li>Where the person being cared for dies. In these circumstances,<br>
    the carer’s leave will end 6 weeks after the death or on the date<br>
    specified in the confirmation document – whichever is earlier </li>
  <li>Where an employer is of the opinion that the employee, or the<br>
    person receiving the care, no longer meets the conditions for carer’s<br>
    leave. In such a situation, the employer may refer the matter to the<br>
    Department of Social Protection for a decision. </li>
</ul><p>Following the ending of the carer’s leave, the employer must give<br>
notice of this fact (including the date of return) in writing to the<br>
Department of Social Protection.<br></p>

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you become pregnant while in employment, you are entitled to take
maternity leave. The entitlement to a basic period of maternity leave from
employment extends to all female employees (including casual workers),
regardless of how long you have been working for the organisation or the number
of hours worked per week. You can also avail of additional unpaid maternity
leave. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0034/index.html">Maternity
Protection Acts 1994 and 2004</a> provide your statutory minimum entitlements
in relation to maternity at work including maternity leave.</p>

<p>You are entitled to 26 weeks’ maternity leave together with 16 weeks
additional unpaid maternity leave, which begins immediately after the end of
maternity leave.</p>

<p>Under the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004 at least 2 weeks have to
be taken before the end of the week of your baby's expected birth and at least
4 weeks after. You can decide how you would like to take the remaining weeks.
Generally, employees take 2 weeks before the birth and the remaining weeks
after. If you qualify for Maternity Benefit (see below) at least 2 and no more
than 16 weeks must be taken before the end of the week the baby is due.</p>

<h3>Payment during maternity leave</h3>

<p>Your entitlement to pay and superannuation during maternity leave depends on
the terms of your contract of employment. Employers are not obliged to pay
women who are on maternity leave. You may qualify for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/maternity_benefit.html">Maternity
Benefit</a> from the Department of Social Protection if you have sufficient
PRSI contributions. However an employee’s contract could provide for
additional rights to payment during the leave period, so that, for example, the
employee could receive full pay less the amount of Maternity Benefit
payable.</p>

<h3>Additional maternity leave</h3>

<p>You are also entitled to take up to a further 16 weeks’ additional
maternity leave which begins immediately after the end of maternity leave. This
period is not covered by Maternity Benefit, nor is your employer obliged,
unless otherwise agreed, to make any payment during this period - see below. If
you become ill while you are on additional maternity leave you may ask your
employer if you may end the additional maternity leave. If your employer agrees
you will not be entitled to the remainder of the maternity leave but will be
treated as being on <a shape="rect" href="sick_leave.html">sick leave</a> and
you may be entitled to <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">Illness
Benefit</a>.</p>

<h3>Public holidays and annual leave </h3>

<p>You are entitled to leave for any public holidays that occur during your
maternity leave (including additional maternity leave). The right of employees
to leave for public holidays is set down in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/sec0021.html#zza20y1997s21">Section
21 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997</a>. </p>

<p>Apart from pay and superannuation, time spent on maternity leave (including
additional maternity leave) is treated as though you have been in employment,
and this time can be used to accumulate <a shape="rect" href="annual_leave_public_holidays.html">annual leave</a> and <a shape="rect" href="public_holidays_in_ireland.html">public holiday</a> entitlement</p>

<h3>Stillbirths and miscarriages <br></h3>

<p>If you have a <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/miscarriage_and_stillbirth/">stillbirth or
miscarriage</a> any time after the 24th week of pregnancy, you are entitled to
full maternity leave. This means a basic period of 26 weeks and 16 weeks of
additional maternity leave. If you have satisfied the PRSI requirements,
Maternity Benefit is payable for the 26 weeks of the basic maternity leave. </p>

<p>To apply for Maternity Benefit following a stillbirth, you need to send a
letter from your doctor with the Maternity Benefit application form, confirming
the expected date of birth, the actual date of birth and the number of weeks of
pregnancy. </p>

<h3>Health and safety leave</h3>

<p>An employer should carry out separate risk assessments in relation to
pregnant employees and those who have recently given birth or are
breastfeeding. If there are particular risks, these should be either removed or
the employee moved away from them. If neither of these options is possible, the
employee should be given health and safety leave from work which may continue
up to the beginning of maternity leave. During health and safety leave,
employers must pay employees their normal wages for the first 3 weeks as set
out in the Maternity Protection (Health and Safety Leave Remuneration)
Regulations, <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/si/0020.html">SI
20/1995</a>. After this, <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/health_safety_benefit.html">Health
and Safety Benefit</a> may be paid. The Health and Safety Authority website has
a list of <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Workplace_Health/Sensitive_Risk_Groups/Pregnant_at_Work_Frequently_Asked_Questions/">Pregnant
at Work FAQs.</a></p>

<h3>Father's entitlement to maternity leave <br></h3>

<p>Fathers are entitled to maternity leave if the mother dies within 40 weeks
of the birth. In these circumstances, the father is entitled to a period of
leave, the extent of which depends on the actual date of the mother’s death.
If the mother dies within 24 weeks of the birth he has an optional right to the
additional maternity leave. If the mother's death is over 24 weeks after the
birth, the father is entitled to leave until 40 weeks after the birth. The
leave starts within 7 days of the mother's death.</p>

<h3>Paternity leave</h3>

<p>New parents (other than the mother of the child) can get 2 weeks’
statutory <a href="paternity_leave.html">paternity leave</a> from employment
or self-employment following the birth or adoption of a child on or after 1
September 2016.</p>

<h3>Postponing maternity leave </h3>

<p>Section 7 of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004 provides for
postponement of maternity leave in strict circumstances, that is, if your baby
is hospitalised. This right to postpone leave applies whether you are on
maternity leave, or on additional unpaid maternity leave. Note, your employer
has the right to refuse your application to postpone your maternity leave.
There are details about postponing maternity leave in 'Further information'
below.</p>

<h3>Returning to work <br></h3>

<p>Under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0034/sec0026.html#zza34y1994s26">Section
26 of the Maternity Protection Act 1994</a> you are entitled to return to work
to the same job with the same contract of employment. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0034/sec0027.html#zza34y1994s27">Section
27 of the Act</a> states that if it is not reasonably practicable for your
employer to allow you to return to your job, then they must provide you with
suitable alternative work. This new position should not be on terms
substantially less favourable than those of your previous job. </p>

<p>Otherwise, you are entitled to be treated as if you had been at work during
your maternity leave. Your employment conditions cannot be worsened by the fact
that you have taken maternity leave, and if pay or other conditions have
improved while you have been on maternity leave then you are entitled to these
benefits when you return to work.</p>

<p><strong>PRSI contributions:</strong> you will automatically be awarded <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">PRSI
credits</a> while you are getting Maternity Benefit. If you avail of unpaid
additional maternity leave you must get your employer to complete an <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/matl_credits.pdf">application form for
maternity leave credits (pdf)</a> after you return to work. </p>

<p>If you are <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/after_your_baby_is_born/breastfeeding.html">breastfeeding</a>
you may be entitled to some time off or a reduction in hours without loss of
pay for up to 26 weeks after the birth.</p>

<p>If you decide not to return to work after your period of maternity leave,
you are required to give <a shape="rect" href="../../starting_work_and_changing_job/changing_job/giving_notice.html">your
employer notice in the usual manner</a>. </p>

<p>You are protected against <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfair
dismissal</a> for claiming your rights under maternity protection legislation -
see 'How to apply' below</p>

<h3>Medical visits </h3>

<p>Once your pregnancy is confirmed you may take reasonable time off for
medical visits connected with the pregnancy. There is no maximum or minimum
amount of time off specified for these visits. Rather, you are entitled to as
much time off as is necessary to attend each visit. This includes the time
required to travel to and from the appointment and the time taken for the
appointment itself. </p>

<p>You will need to provide your employer with medical evidence confirming the
pregnancy, giving 2 weeks’ notice of your medical visits. You should show
your appointment card if requested by your employer at any time after your
first appointment. You may also take time off for medical visits after the
birth for up to 14 weeks following the birth. You are entitled to be paid while
keeping these medical appointments both before and after the birth. </p>

<h3>Ante-natal classes</h3>

<p>You may also be entitled to take paid time off to attend some <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/before_your_baby_is_born/antenatal_visits.html">ante-natal
classes. </a>Your entitlement is for one set of ante-natal classes except for
the last 3 classes of the set. Fathers are entitled to paid time off to attend
the last 2 classes in the set of ante-natal classes.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p><strong>Notice:</strong> You must give your employer at least 4 weeks'
written notice of your intention to take maternity leave and you must also
provide your employer with a medical certificate confirming your pregnancy. If
you intend to take the additional 16 weeks’ maternity leave you must provide
your employer with at least 4 weeks' written notice. Both these notices can be
given at the same time. </p>

<p><strong>Early birth</strong>: If your baby is born more than 4 weeks before
your due date, you will have fulfilled the notice requirements if you give your
employer written notice within 14 days of the birth.</p>

<p><strong>Medical certification:</strong> <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0034/sec0011.html#zza34y1994s11">Section
11 of the Maternity Protection Act 1994</a> provides that if you are certified
by your doctor as needing to start maternity leave for medical reasons, your
maternity leave will start on the earlier date as specified on the medical
certificate. In this case you are considered to have complied with the notice
requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Return to work:</strong> You must give your employer at least 4
weeks' written notice of your intention to return to work </p>

<p>It is important to comply with these notice requirements, as failure to do
so may cause loss of rights. </p>

<p>You must notify your employer as soon as possible if you wish to postpone
your maternity leave (but remember, your employer can refuse this application).

<h3>Postponing maternity leave</h3>

<p>Section 7 of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004 provides for
postponement of maternity leave which applies whether you are on maternity
leave, or on additional unpaid maternity leave. The maximum amount of time the
leave can be postponed is six months. Note, your employer has the right to
refuse your application to postpone your maternity leave. </p>

<p>You may only request that your maternity leave be postponed once you have
taken at least 14 weeks' maternity leave, 4 of which must have been taken after
the birth. (This provision does not apply to fathers who are on maternity
leave). </p>

<p>If you postpone your maternity leave and return to work, then you may take
your leave in one block, not later than <span>7 days after</span> the
<span>child has been discharged from hospital</span>. Your employer may request
a letter from the hospital confirming the child has been hospitalised and
following discharge, a letter confirming the date of discharge. </p>

<p>If you postpone your maternity leave and return to employment, you need to
notify the Department of Social Protection of this. You must notify them in
writing that your child has been hospitalised and you have returned to
employment. A letter from your family doctor (GP)/hospital is required to
confirm to the Department that the child has been discharged from hospital and
your maternity benefit should resume. Your <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">Personal
Public Service Number</a> (PPS) Number should be clearly identified on all
documents you send to the Department. </p>

<p>Remember, you may only apply to postpone your maternity leave if the baby
has been hospitalised - not if the child is simply unwell.</p>

<h3>Illness while on postponed maternity leave</h3>

<p>If you have postponed your maternity leave and become ill when you return to
work (before resuming your postponed leave), you may be considered to have
started your resumed leave on the first day of your absence because of illness.
Alternatively, you may choose to forfeit your right to resumed leave and have
your leave treated as <a shape="rect" href="sick_leave.html">sick leave</a>.

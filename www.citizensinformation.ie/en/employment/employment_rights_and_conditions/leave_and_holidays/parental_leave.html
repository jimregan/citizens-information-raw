<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0030/index.html">Parental
Leave Act 1998,</a> as amended by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0013/index.html">Parental
Leave (Amendment) Act 2006</a>, allows parents to take parental leave from
employment in respect of certain children. A person acting in loco parentis
with respect to an eligible child is also eligible. </p>

<h3>Extension of parental leave to 18 weeks</h3>

<p>On 8 March 2013 the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/si/0081.html">European Union
(Parental Leave) Regulations 2013</a> increased the amount of parental leave
available to each parent per child from 14 weeks to 18 weeks. (Those who have
taken or are taking 14 weeks’ parental leave are also entitled to this extra
4 weeks.) The Regulations extended the age limit for a child with a long-term
illness to 16 years. They also provide that a parent returning from parental
leave may request a change in working hours – see ‘Rules’ below. The
Regulations apply to all children who qualify for parental
leave.<strong></strong></p>

<h3>Age of child</h3>

<p>Leave can be taken in respect of a child no later than the child's 8th
birthday. If a child was adopted between the age of 6 and 8, leave in respect
of that child may be taken up to 2 years after the date of the adoption order.
In the case of a child with a disability or a long-term illness leave may be
taken up to 16 years of age. In addition an extension may also be allowed where
illness or other incapacity prevented the employee taking the leave within the
normal period.</p>

<h3>Amount of parental leave</h3>

<p>Since 8 March 2013 the amount of parental leave available for each child
amounts to a total of 18 working weeks per child. Where an employee has more
than one child, parental leave is limited to 18 weeks in a 12-month period.
This can be longer if the employer agrees. Parents of twins or triplets can
take more than 18 weeks of parental leave in a year.</p>

<p>The 18 weeks per child may be taken in one continuous period or in 2
separate blocks of a minimum of 6 weeks. There must be a gap of at least 10
weeks between the 2 periods of parental leave per child. However, if your
employer agrees you can separate your leave into periods of days or even hours.
</p>

<p>Both parents have an equal separate entitlement to parental leave. Unless
you and your partner work for the same employer, you can only claim your own
parental leave entitlement (18 weeks per child). If you both work for the same
employer and your employer agrees you may transfer 14 weeks of your parental
leave entitlement to each other. </p>

<h3>Illness of parent</h3>

<p>If the parent becomes ill while on parental leave and is unable to care for
the child the leave can be suspended for the duration of the illness. In order
to suspend the parental leave the employee must give written notice and
relevant evidence of the illness to the employer as soon as is reasonably
practicable. The parental leave resumes after the illness. During the illness
the parent is treated as an employee who is sick.</p>

<h3>Employment rights while on parental leave</h3>

<p>You are not entitled to pay from your employer while you are on parental
leave nor are you entitled to any social welfare payment equivalent to <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/maternity_benefit.html">Maternity
Benefit</a> or <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/adoptive_benefit.html">Adoptive
Benefit</a>. </p>

<p>Taking parental leave does not affect other employment rights you have.
Apart from the loss of pay and pension contributions, your position remains as
if no parental leave had been taken. This means, for example, that time spent
on parental leave can be used to accumulate your annual leave entitlement. </p>

<p>The legislation only provides for the minimum entitlement. Your contract may
give you more extensive rights. </p>

<h3>Social insurance contributions </h3>

<p>The Minister for Social Protection has introduced Regulations to ensure
preservation of social insurance (<acronym title="Pay-Related Social Insurance">PRSI</acronym>) records for employees who
take parental leave. Your employer must write to the Records Update Section of
Department of Social Protection (DSP), detailing the weeks you have not worked,
so that you can get <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">credited
PRSI contributions</a> for this time (see 'Where to apply' below). You can find
information about <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Publications/sw12/Pages/15CanIqualifyforparentalleavecredits.aspx">credited
contributions and parental leave</a> on the DSP website. </p>

<h3>Annual leave and public holidays </h3>

<p>While on parental leave, you must be regarded for employment rights purposes
as still working. This means that you can build up <a shape="rect" href="annual_leave_public_holidays.html">annual leave</a> while on parental
leave. If your annual holidays fall due during parental leave, they may be
taken at a later time. You are entitled to any <a shape="rect" href="public_holidays_in_ireland.html">public holidays</a> that occur while you
are on parental leave. Your public holiday entitlement can be added to the end
of your parental leave. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>
<ul><li>Generally you must have been working for your employer for a year before
    you are entitled to parental leave. However if your child is very near the
    age threshold and you have been working for your employer for more than 3
    months but less than one year you are entitled to pro-rata parental leave.
    This is one week's leave for every month of employment completed. </li>
  <li>If you change job and have used part of your parental leave allowance you
    can use the remainder after one year's employment with your new employer
    provided your child is still under the qualifying age </li>
  <li>Apart from a refusal on the grounds on non-entitlement, an employer may
    also postpone the leave for up to 6 months. This must be done before the
    confirmation document is signed. After that, the leave cannot be postponed
    without further written agreement. Grounds for such a postponement include
    lack of cover or the fact that other employees are already on parental
    leave. Normally only one postponement is allowed, but it may be postponed
    twice if the reason is seasonal variations in the volume of work.</li>
  <li>Parental leave is to be used only to take care of the child concerned. If
    the parental leave is taken and used for another purpose the employer is
    entitled to cancel the leave. </li>
  <li>Employers must keep records of all parental leave taken by their
    employees. These records must include the period of employment of each
    employee and the dates and times of the leave taken. Employers must keep
    these records for 8 years. If an employer fails to keep records they may be
    liable, on summary conviction, to a class C fine. </li>
  <li>You are entitled to return to your job after your parental leave unless
    it is not reasonably practicable for the employer to allow you to return to
    your old job. If this is the case you must be offered a suitable
    alternative on terms no less favourable compared with the previous job
    including any improvement in pay or other conditions which occurred while
    you were on parental leave. </li>
  <li>The legislation protects parents who take parental leave from <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfair
    dismissal</a>.</li>
  <li>Since 8 March 2013, when you return to work after taking parental leave,
    you are entitled to ask for a change in your work pattern or working hours
    for a set period. Your employer must consider your request but is not
    obliged to grant it. <br></li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You must give written notice to your employer of your intention to take
parental leave. You should inform your employer in writing at least 6 weeks
before the leave is due to start. The notice should state the starting date and
how long the leave will last. After this not less than 4 weeks before the leave
is due to start, you will need to sign a document with your employer confirming
the details of the leave.</p>

<p>For more information on parental leave you can contact the Workplace
Relations Commission's <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Workplace_Relations_Services/Info_Cust_Serv/">Information
and Customer Service</a> - see 'Where to apply' below. </p>

<p>Disputes about parental leave may be referred by the employee or the
employer within 6 months of the dispute or complaint occurring. You must use
the online complaint form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.
The time limit may be extended for up to a further 6 months, but only where
there is a reasonable cause which prevented the complaint being brought within
the normal time limit.</p>

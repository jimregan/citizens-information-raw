<p>There are many types of leave or time off work to which you may be entitled.
These include <a shape="rect" href="annual_leave_public_holidays.html">annual
leave,</a> <a shape="rect" href="public_holidays_in_ireland.html">public
holidays,</a> <a shape="rect" href="sick_leave.html">sick leave</a>, <a shape="rect" href="maternity_leave.html">maternity leave</a>, <a shape="rect" href="paternity_leave.html">paternity leave</a>, <a shape="rect" href="adoptive_leave.html">adoptive leave</a>, <a shape="rect" href="carers_leave_from_employment.html">carerâ€™s leave</a> and <a shape="rect" href="parental_leave.html">parental leave</a>. There are also
times when you may require leave or time off work for specific reasons. This
could be when you have a family crisis, when you are called for jury service or
if you wish to take study leave or a career break. In some cases you are
entitled to paid leave but in others you are not.</p>

<h3>Force majeure leave</h3>

<p>If you have a family crisis the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0030/index.html">Parental
Leave Acts 1998 and 2006</a> give an employee a limited right to leave from
work. This is known as force majeure leave. It arises where, for urgent family
reasons, the immediate presence of the employee is indispensable owing to an
injury or illness of a close family member.</p>

<p><span>Force majeure leave does not give any entitlement to leave following
the death of a close family member. </span></p>

<p>A close family member is defined as one of the following:</p>
<ul><li>A child or adopted child of the employee </li>
  <li>The husband, wife or partner of the employee </li>
  <li>Parent or grandparent of the employee </li>
  <li>Brother or sister of the employee </li>
  <li>Person to whom the employee has a duty of care (that is, he/she is acting
    in loco parentis) </li>
  <li>A person in a relationship of domestic dependency with the employee </li>
  <li>Persons of any other class (if any) as may be prescribed </li>
</ul><p>The maximum amount of leave is 3 days in any 12-month period or 5 days in a
36-month period. You are <span>entitled to be paid</span> while you are on
force majeure leave - see 'How to apply' below for more details. Your employer
may grant you further leave.</p>

<p>You are protected against <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfair
dismissal</a> for taking force majeure leave or proposing to take it. </p>

<h3>Compassionate leave</h3>

<p>If a member of your close family dies you have no entitlement to force
majeure leave. Other compassionate leave not covered by force majeure leave
will depend on your employment contract, custom and practice within your
workplace or the employer's discretion. </p>

<p>There is a <a shape="rect" href="/en/death/bereavement_counselling_and_support/bereavement_counselling_andsupport_services.html">range
of bereavement counselling and support services available</a>. Employees and
employers may also find this <a href="http://hospicefoundation.ie/bereavement-2/working-in-bereavement-and-loss/grief-in-the-workplace/">series
of short, simple information leaflets aimed at the bereaved and those who
support them, of assistance</a>. </p>

<h3>Jury service</h3>

<p>If you are called for <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courtroom/jury_service.html">jury service</a>, generally you are
obliged to attend. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1976/en/act/pub/0004/index.html">Juries
Act 1976</a> requires that an employee or an apprentice who is called for jury
service be given time off to attend the court. Under the Act while you are
absent from work to comply with a jury summons you are entitled to be paid and
you should not lose any other employment entitlements or rights. So, for
example, the time spent on jury service will not mean any loss of annual leave
entitlement.</p>

<h3>Career break or study leave</h3>

<p>There is no entitlement to take unpaid leave such as a career break or study
leave. You may have a provision in your <a shape="rect" href="../contracts_of_employment/contract_of_employment.html">contract of
employment</a> about this or you may be able to negotiate with your employer.
An employer should consider requests for a career break or study leave made on
an individual basis. </p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p><span><strong>Force majeure leave:</strong></span> you must notify your
employer as soon as practicably possible that you need to avail of force
majeure leave. Immediately on your return to work, you must make your
application in writing to your employer. Your application in writing should
include your name, PPS number, name and address of your employer, date(s) on
which you took force majeure leave and reasons why, and your relationship to
the person who was injured or ill. Your contract of employment may require you
to provide a medical certificate. </p>

<p>As with parental leave, your employer must keep records of all force majeure
leave taken by employees. </p>

<p>Further information about force majeure leave is available from Workplace
Relations Commission's <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Workplace_Relations_Services/Info_Cust_Serv/">Information
and Customer Service</a> - see 'Where to apply' below. </p>

<p>If there is a dispute between you and your employer about force majeure
leave the issue can be referred within 6 months of the dispute occurring. You
must use the online complaint form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>).
The time limit may be extended for up to a further 6 months, but only where
there is a reasonable cause which prevented the complaint being brought within
the normal time limit.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>With effect from 1 September 2016, new parents (other than the mother of the
child) are entitled to paternity leave from employment or self-employment
following birth or adoption of a child – see ‘Rules’ below for who is
eligible. The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/act/11/enacted/en/html">Paternity
Leave and Benefit Act 2016</a> provides for statutory paternity leave of 2
weeks. The provisions apply to births and adoptions on or after 1 September
2016. You can start paternity leave at any time within the first 6 months
following the birth or adoption placement. </p>

<h3>Payment during paternity leave </h3>

<p>Your entitlement to pay and superannuation during paternity leave depends on
the terms of your contract of employment. Employers are not obliged to pay
employees who are on paternity leave. You may qualify for <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/paternity_benefit.html">Paternity
Benefit</a> from the Department of Social Protection if you have sufficient
PRSI contributions. However an employee’s contract could provide for
additional rights to payment by the employer during the leave period, so that,
for example, the employee could receive full pay less the amount of Paternity
Benefit payable. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Who is eligible </h3>

<p>Under the Act, a “relevant parent” for the purposes of paternity leave
entitlement includes:</p>
<ul><li>The father of the child</li>
  <li>The spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the mother of the child</li>
  <li>The parent of a donor-conceived child</li>
</ul><p>In the case of an adopted child, the relevant parent includes: </p>
<ul><li>The nominated parent in the case of a married same-sex couple or</li>
  <li>The spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the adopting mother or sole
    male adopter </li>
</ul><p>The entitlement to 2 weeks’ paternity leave from employment extends to all
employees (including casual workers), regardless of how long you have been
working for the organisation or the number of hours worked per week. If more
than one child is born or adopted at the same time, for example, twins, you are
only entitled to a single period of 2 weeks’ paternity leave. </p>

<h3>Taking paternity leave </h3>

<p>You can choose to take paternity leave at any time in the 26 weeks following
the birth or adoption. You must notify your employer in writing that you intend
to take paternity leave and provide your intended dates no later than 4 weeks
before your leave. You will be required to provide a certificate from your
spouse or partner's doctor confirming when your baby is due, or confirmation of
the baby’s actual date of birth if you apply for leave after the birth has
occurred. </p>

<p>In the case of adoption, you must produce a certificate of placement in
relation to the child. </p>

<h3>Postponing paternity leave </h3>

<p>The Paternity Leave and Benefit Act 2016 provides for postponement of
paternity leave. For example, if the birth is later than expected or if the
date of placement of an adopted child is postponed, you may postpone the date
of the leave. </p>

<p>Under Section 11, if you are sick before your paternity leave starts, you
may postpone the paternity leave until you recover. You should notify your
employer in writing and provide evidence of your illness. </p>

<p>If your baby is hospitalised, you can ask your employer in writing if you
can postpone all or part of your paternity leave. </p>

<h3>Public holidays and annual leave </h3>

<p>Apart from pay and superannuation, time spent on paternity leave is treated
as though you have been in employment, and this time can be used to accumulate
<a href="annual_leave_public_holidays.html">annual leave</a> and <a href="public_holidays_in_ireland.html">public holiday</a> entitlement. </p>

<h3>Death of a parent </h3>

<p>In certain circumstances, fathers are entitled to maternity or adoptive
leave if the mother dies. The extent of this period of leave depends on the
actual date of the mother’s death. The leave starts within 7 days of the
mother's death. </p>

<p>If the father has not already taken paternity leave, he may take it at the
end of this maternity or adoptive leave. </p>

<p>If the parent entitled to paternity leave dies, their paternity leave may be
transferred to the employed surviving parent. </p>

<h3>Employers </h3>

<p>Employers must keep records of paternity leave taken by their employees.
These records must include the period of employment of each employee and the
dates and times of the leave taken. Employers must keep these records for 8
years. </p>

<h3>Returning to work </h3>

<p>Under the Act, you are entitled to return to work to the same job with the
same contract of employment. Section 23 of the Act states that, if it is not
reasonably practicable for your employer to allow you to return to your job,
then they must provide you with suitable alternative work. This new position
should not be on terms substantially less favourable than those of your
previous job. </p>

<p>You are protected against <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/victimisation_at_work.html">penalisation</a>
and <a href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfair
dismissal</a> for claiming your rights under paternity leave legislation –
see 'How to apply' below. </p>

<h3>Other statutory leave </h3>

<p>Employees may be entitled to <a href="parental_leave.html">parental
leave</a>. Parental leave entitles both parents who qualify to take a period of
up to 18 weeks' unpaid leave from employment in respect of a child no later
than the child's 8th birthday. </p>

<p>Sole male adopters and adoptive mothers may be entitled to <a href="adoptive_leave.html">adoptive leave</a>. </p>

<p>If you need to take time off work urgently because of injury or illness of a
close family member, you may be entitled to <a href="types_of_leave_from_work.html">force majeure leave</a>. </p>

<p>If you need to provide full-time care for someone in need of full-time care
and attention for a while, you can apply to take <a href="carers_leave_from_employment.html">carer’s leave</a> from your
employment. </p>

<h3>Non-statutory paternal leave </h3>

<p>Arrangements where employers provide this type of paid leave following the
birth or adoption of a child are the result of negotiation and agreement
reached between the employer and employee. These arrangements are not covered
by employment law so if an employer agrees to provide time off to an employee
as paternal leave for a specified period (either with or without pay), it is
entirely discretionary. The employee usually applies for this leave in writing
before the birth or adoption. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You should apply to your employer in writing at least 4 weeks before taking
your paternity leave. If you are adopting a child, you must provide
confirmation of the date of the child’s placement. </p>

<p>You must provide your employer with proof of the expected date of
confinement of your spouse or partner. In other words, you will be required to
provide a certificate from your spouse or partner's doctor confirming when your
baby is due, or confirmation of the actual date of birth if you are applying
for leave after the birth. </p>

<p>If you need further information about paternity leave, you should contact
the Workplace Relations Commission's <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Workplace_Relations_Services/Info_Cust_Serv/">Information
and Customer Service</a>. </p>

<p>If you have a dispute with your employer about paternity leave, or if you
have been dismissed for claiming your rights under paternity leave legislation,
you may make a complaint within 6 months of the dispute or complaint occurring.
You must use the online complaint form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.
The time limit may be extended for up to a further 6 months, but only where
there is a reasonable cause which prevented the complaint being brought within
the normal time limit. </p>

<p><strong>Paternity Benefit:</strong> You should apply for <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/paternity_benefit.html">Paternity
Benefit</a> at least 4 weeks before the date you intend to start your paternity
leave. If you are self-employed you should apply 12 weeks before. You will be
able to apply for Paternity Benefit online at <a href="https://www.mywelfare.ie/Account/Login">mywelfare.ie</a>. You must have a
<a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/public_services_card.html">Public

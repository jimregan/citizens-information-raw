<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Generally, the amount of pay you receive for working is a matter for
agreement between you and your employer. These negotiations normally occur when
you receive an offer of a job. However under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0005/index.html">National
Minimum Wage Act 2000</a> most employees are entitled to a minimum wage. There
are sub-minimum rates for some people such as <a shape="rect" href="../../starting_work_and_changing_job/young_people_at_work/rights_of_young_workers.html">those
aged under 18</a> - see 'Rates' section below. </p>

<p>There are other minimum rates of pay for employees in certain sectors. In
some sectors they are set out in Employment Regulation Orders (EROs) made by <a shape="rect" href="../industrial_relations_and_trade_unions/joint_labour_committees.html">Joint
Labour Committees</a>. You can find out more in our document, <a shape="rect" href="../industrial_relations_and_trade_unions/employment_regulation_orders_and_registered_employment_agreements.html">Employment
Regulation Orders and registered employment agreements.</a> </p>

<h3>National minimum wage</h3>

<p>Since 1 January 2017, under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/si/516/made/en/print">SI
516/2016</a>, the national minimum wage for an experienced adult employee is
<strong>€9.25</strong> per hour. An experienced adult employee for the
purposes of the National Minimum Wage Act is an employee who has an employment
of any kind in any 2 years over the age of 18 - see also 'Rates' section below.
You can read this list of <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Frequently_Asked_Questions/National_Minimum_Wage/">frequently
asked questions on the national minimum wage</a>.</p>

<p>However, the national minimum wage (NMW) does not stop an employer from
offering a higher wage.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Calculating the hourly rate</h3>

<p>Under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0005/sec0020.html#partiii-sec20">Section
20</a> of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 the basic method of calculation is
to divide the gross pay by the total number of hours worked. To begin with,
however, it is necessary to note what pay is taken into account, what hours are
included as working hours and what is the pay reference period (over what
period the calculation is made).</p>

<h4><span>What does not count as pay?</span></h4>

<p><span></span>There are a number of items that are not to be included in the
minimum wage calculation, these are:</p>
<ul><li>Overtime premium </li>
  <li>Call-out premium </li>
  <li>Service pay </li>
  <li>Unsocial hours premium </li>
  <li>Tips which are placed in a central fund managed by the employer and paid
    as part of your wages </li>
  <li>Premiums for working public holidays, Saturdays or Sundays </li>
  <li>Allowances for special or additional duties </li>
  <li>On-call or standby allowances </li>
  <li>Certain payments in relation to absences from work, for example, sick
    pay, holiday pay or pay during health and safety leave </li>
  <li>Payment connected with leaving the employment including retirement </li>
  <li>Contributions paid by the employer into any occupational pension scheme
    available to you </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/redundancy.html">Redundancy
    payments</a> </li>
  <li>An advance payment of, for example, salary: the amount involved will be
    taken into account for the period in which it would normally have been paid
  </li>
  <li>Payment in kind or benefit in kind, other than board and/or lodgings </li>
  <li>Payment not connected with the person's employment </li>
  <li>Compensation for injury or loss of tools </li>
  <li>Award as part of a staff suggestion scheme </li>
  <li>Loan by the employer to you </li>
</ul><h4><span>What counts as pay?</span></h4>

<p><span></span>For the purposes of the national minimum wage your gross wage
includes, for example, the basic salary and any shift premium, bonus or service
charge. </p>

<p>If you receive food (known as board) and/or accommodation (known as
lodgings) from your employer, the following amounts are included in the minimum
wage calculation: </p>
<ul><li>€54.13 for full board and lodgings per week, or €7.73 per day </li>
  <li>€32.14 for full board only per week, or €4.60 per day </li>
  <li>€21.85 for lodgings only per week, or €3.14 per day </li>
</ul><h4><span>Working hours </span></h4>

<p><span></span>Your working hours are whichever is the greater:</p>
<ul><li>The hours set out in any document such as a <a shape="rect" href="../contracts_of_employment/contract_of_employment.html">contract of
    employment</a>, collective agreement or statement of terms of employment
    provided under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0005/index.html">Terms
    of Employment (Information) Act 1994,</a> </li>
</ul><p>or</p>
<ul><li>The actual hours worked or available for work and paid </li>
</ul><p>"Working hours" include:</p>
<ul><li>Overtime </li>
  <li>Travel time where this is part of the job </li>
  <li>Time spent on training authorised by the employer and during normal
    working hours </li>
</ul><p>"Working hours" does not include:</p>
<ul><li>Time spent on standby other than at the workplace </li>
  <li>Time on leave, lay-off, strike or after payment in lieu of notice </li>
  <li>Time spent travelling to or from work </li>
</ul><h4><span>Pay reference period</span></h4>

<p>The employer selects the period, known as the pay reference period, from
which the average hourly pay will be calculated. This might be, for example, on
a weekly or fortnightly basis, but cannot be for a period longer than a month.
</p>

<p>The employer must include details of the pay reference period in the
statement of employment conditions to be given to an employee under the Terms
of Employment (Information) Act 1994.</p>

<p>You may request a written statement from your employer of your average rate
of pay for any pay reference period within the last 12 months. The employer has
4 weeks to supply the statement.</p>

<h3>Exceptions to those entitled to receive the national minimum wage</h3>

<p>There are some exceptions to those entitled to receive the national minimum
wage. The legislation does not apply to a person employed by a close relative
(for example, a spouse, civil partner or parent) nor does it apply to those in
statutory apprenticeships. Also some employees such as young people under 18
and trainees are only guaranteed a reduced or sub-minimum rate of the national
minimum wage.</p>

<h4><strong>Sub-minimum rates</strong></h4>

<p>Under the National Minimum Wage Act young people and those in the first 2
years of employment can be paid lower rates – called <em>sub-minimum</em>
rates. See ‘Sub-minimum rates’ below for examples of how these rates are
applied depending on age and experience. </p>

<h4><strong>Trainees</strong></h4>

<p>The National Minimum Wage Act also provides sub-minimum rates which apply to
employees who are aged over 18 and undergoing a course of structured training
or directed study that is authorised or approved of by the employer - see
'Rates' below </p>

<p>The Act provides certain criteria which the training course must meet if the
trainee rates are to apply. For example, the training or study must be for the
purposes of improving the work performance of the employee; the employee's
participation on the training or study must be directed or approved by the
employer; at least 10% of the training must occur away from the employee’s
ordinary operational duties; there must be an assessment and certification
procedure or written confirmation on the completion of the training course.</p>

<h3>Exemption for employer</h3>

<p>If an employer cannot afford to pay the national minimum wage due to
financial difficulty the Labour Court may exempt an employer from paying the
minimum wage rate for between 3 months and one year. Only one such exemption
can be allowed.</p>

<p>The employer must apply to the Labour Court for the exemption with the
consent of a majority of the employees, who must also agree to be bound by the
Labour Court decision.</p>

<p>The employer must demonstrate that they are unable to pay the national
minimum wage and that, if compelled to do so, would have to lay-off employees
or terminate their employment.</p>

<p>An exemption may only be sought from paying the full rate of the national
minimum wage, not for cases covered by the reduced rate, for example, employees
who are under 18 years of age.</p>

<h3>Victimisation</h3>

<p>If you seek your entitlement to the national minimum wage you are protected
from victimisation or dismissal. <a shape="rect" href="../../enforcement_and_redress/victimisation_at_work.html">Victimisation</a>
is prohibited by the legislation. In addition, if you are dismissed for seeking
the national minimum wage, you may bring a claim for <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfair
dismissal</a> regardless of length of service or number of hours worked per
week.</p>

<p>If you are due an increase under the National Minimum Wage Act your employer
cannot reduce your working hours without a corresponding reduction in duties or
the amount of work.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you are not receiving the national minimum wage, you may enforce your
rights by completing the online complaint form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.
In the online complaint form you have 2 options:</p>

<p>You may either request an <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/national_employment_rights_authority.html">inspector
from the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC)</a> to investigate a claim that
the national minimum wage is not being paid</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>You may refer a dispute to a <a shape="rect" href="../../enforcement_and_redress/rights_commissioner.html">WRC
adjudicator</a>. However this may only be done where you have requested from
the employer a statement outlining the calculation of the average hourly pay.
You must refer the dispute with 6 months of the supplying of the statement.
(The time limit for referral limit may be extended to a maximum of 12 months.)
Where the employer fails to provide the statement the time starts from the date
at which the employer should have provided the statement, that is within 4
weeks of the request.</p>

<p>Note: you may not refer a complaint to both an adjudicator and an inspector
in relation to the same dispute under the Minimum Wage Act.</p>

<p>If you are alleging victimisation, you should request that the employer
restore your employment conditions to their position before the victimisation.
Where the employer fails to do this within 2 weeks of the request, you may
refer the matter to the WRC adjudicator. This referral must take place within 6
months (which may be extended to a maximum of 12 months) of the alleged
victimisation.</p>

<h3>Young employees and those people in first 2 years of employment</h3>

<p>Since 1 January 2017 the National Minimum Wage Act provides the following
sub-minimum rates:</p>
<ul><li>An employee who is aged under 18 is entitled to €6.48 per hour (70% of
    the minimum wage) </li>
  <li>An employee who is in the first year of employment since the age of 18 is
    entitled to €7.40 per hour (80% of minimum wage) </li>
  <li>An employee who is in the second year of employment since the date of
    first employment over the age of 18 is entitled to €8.33 per hour (90% of
    the minimum wage) </li>
</ul><p><strong>Example 1:</strong> John was aged 17 when he started work on 1
January 2015 so he was entitled to 70% of the minimum wage. His 18th birthday
was on 1 April 2015 and after that he was entitled to 80% of the minimum wage
as he was in his first year of employment after the age of 18. From 1 April
2016, he was entitled to 90% of the minimum wage as he was in his second year
of employment since the age of 18. After 1 April 2017 he is entitled to the
full minimum wage rate as he is an experienced adult worker for the purposes of
the National Minimum Wage Act. (That is, he is not in the first 2 years after
the date of first employment over age 18). You can find a definition of an
experienced adult worker in this list of <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Frequently_Asked_Questions/National_Minimum_Wage/">frequently
asked questions on the national minimum wage</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Mary worked for 6 months when she was 17. She
went to college and, on 1 October 2015, at the age of 20 she started work. She
was entitled to 80% of the minimum wage as she was in her first year of
employment. On 1 June 2016 she turned 21 but her rate of pay did not increase
as she was still in first year of employment after the age of 18. (Her
6-months’ work when aged 17 is not taken into account.) From 1 October 2016
she was entitled to 90% of the minimum wage as she was in her second year of
employment. Mary changed job on 1 December 2016 but she was only entitled to
90% of the minimum wage as she continued to be in her second year of
employment. She is not entitled to the full minimum wage rate until 1 October
2017. This is when her second year of employment ends.</p>

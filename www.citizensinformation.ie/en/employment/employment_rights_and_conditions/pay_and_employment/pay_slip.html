<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0025/index.html">Payment
of Wages Act 1991</a> gives all employees a right to a pay slip which will show
the gross wage and details of all deductions. A pay slip is essentially a
statement in writing from the employer to the employee that outlines the total
pay before tax and all details of any deductions from pay. It can be provided
to you either in electronic format or in hard copy. Your right to a pay slip is
set down in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0025/sec0004.html">Section
4</a> of this Act. </p>

<h3>Deductions from pay</h3>

<p>The Payment of Wages Act 1991 refers to situations where either deductions
are made from pay or the employee is required to make a payment to the
employer. </p>

<p>The following deductions from your pay by your employer are allowed when:</p>
<ul><li>They are required by law, for example, <a shape="rect" href="../../starting_work_and_changing_job/starting_work/tax_and_starting_work.html">tax</a>
    (PAYE) and <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social
    insurance</a> (PRSI), </li>
  <li>They are provided for in the contract of employment, for example
    occupational pension contributions. </li>
  <li>They are made with your written consent, for example, trade union
    subscriptions </li>
  <li>They are to recover an overpayment of wages or expenses </li>
  <li>They are required by a court order, for example, an attachment of
    earnings order in a family law case </li>
  <li>They arise due to your being on strike </li>
</ul><p>Where your employer suffers loss through your fault, for example breakages
or till shortages or your employer supplies a service as part of the job, for
example, a uniform, deductions may be allowed. In these cases a deduction (or
payment by the employee) is only allowed where:</p>
<ul><li>It is allowed for in your contract </li>
  <li>It is fair and reasonable </li>
  <li>You have received a written notice of the deduction - a full week's
    notice if the deduction arises from your mistake </li>
  <li>The amount of the deduction does not exceed the loss or cost of the
    service </li>
  <li>The deduction takes place within 6 months of the loss/cost occurring </li>
</ul><p>Failure to pay all or part of the wages due to an employee is considered an
unlawful deduction and a complaint can be made under the Payment of Wages Act
– see ‘How to apply’ below. Likewise, unpaid notice, holiday pay, bonus
and commission payments can also form part of a claim under the Act.</p>

<p>Complaints about unauthorised deductions from wages under the Payment of
Wages Act 1991 should be made to the <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace
Relations Commission (WRC)</a>. You must use the online complaint form
available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.
A complaint must be brought within 6 months of the date of the deduction. The
time limit may be extended for up to a further 6 months, but only where there
is a reasonable cause which prevented the complaint being brought within the
normal time limit.</p>

<p>An employer who fails to provide a payslip or provides one that is
deliberately falsified is guilty of an offence under the Payment of Wages Act
1991 and may be <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/national_employment_rights_authority.html">issued
with a fixed payment notice</a>. Complaints about payslips should be made as
above. Further information is available in this <a href="http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Guide_to_the_Payment_of_Wages_Act.pdf">explanatory
booklet on the Payment of Wages Act 1991 (pdf)</a> or from <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Workplace_Relations_Services/Info_Cust_Serv/">WRC

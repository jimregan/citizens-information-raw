<p>If your employer is regularly late when paying your wages but you are still
employed, then there are procedures you can use to enforce your legal right to
be paid according to your terms and conditions of employment. </p>

<p>You are entitled to be paid on time as part of your contract of employment.
First, you should try to resolve this dispute about pay with your employer
using any internal complaint or grievances procedures that are available. Then,
if this does not work, and your employer is still paying you late, you may make
a formal complaint to the <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace
Relations Commission</a>. At both stages of these procedures you should use any
supports available, for example, a trade union or your local Citizens
Information Centre to help you get your legal right to payment on time.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l87104">Resolving the dispute with your employer</h2>

<p>You should start by asking your employer to pay you on time and to pay any
arrears of pay that are due. Your <a shape="rect" href="../contracts_of_employment/contract_of_employment.html">written terms of
employment</a> should state when you are paid, for example, weekly or monthly.
If there is a complaint or grievance procedure at your work you should use
this. The Workplace Relations Commission’s <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Good_Workplace_Relations/codes_practice/COP3/">Code
of Practice: Grievance and Disciplinary Procedures</a> states that employers
should have written grievance and disciplinary procedures and they should give
employees copies of these at the start of their employment. If your employer
does not have a grievance procedure or if it is not possible to resolve this
dispute within your workplace, you may have no other choice but to bring a
complaint. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l13aba">Making a complaint</h2>

<p>Your dispute with your employer is a trade dispute which is defined in the
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0019/index.html">Industrial
Relations Act 1990</a> as “any dispute between employers and workers which is
connected with the employment or non-employment, or the terms or conditions of
or affecting the employment, of any person”.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/rights_commissioner.html">adjudicators
of the Workplace Relations Commission</a> have the power to investigate certain
trade disputes.They investigate disputes, grievances and claims that
individuals or small groups of workers make under a range of employment
legislation. </p>

<p>Your complaint is not covered by specific legislation such as the Payment of
Wages Act 1991. Instead, your complaint, which is a trade dispute as defined
above, should be made under the Industrial Relations Acts 1969-2015 – see
‘How to apply’ below. Under this legislation if your employer objects to an
adjudicator hearing you would have to refer the matter to the <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/WR_Bodies/Labour_Court/">Labour
Court</a>.</p>

<p>Following the investigation of your complaint, the adjudicator issues a
decision. Either of you may <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/employment_appeals.html">appeal this
decision</a> to the Labour Court. </p>

<p>Alternatively you could make a complaint under the Terms of Employment
(Information) Acts 1994 and 2001 – see ‘How to apply’ below. If you are
regularly being paid late, this means you are not being paid in accordance with
your written terms of employment.</p>

<p>If you are consistently paid late by your employer you may also consider
that you have no choice but to resign and claim <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/constructive_dismissal.html">constructive
dismissal</a> because your employer has breached the terms of your contract.
Before you do this, you should always seek detailed legal advice as proving
constructive dismissal can often be difficult.</p>

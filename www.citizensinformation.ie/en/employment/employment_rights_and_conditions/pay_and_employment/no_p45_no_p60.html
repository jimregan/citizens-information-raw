<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>At the end of each year, your employer gives you your P60 and if your
employment ends, your employer must give you your P45. They contain details of
your pay as well as the income tax, PRSI and Universal Social Charge that has
been deducted by your employer and paid to Revenue. They are important
documents, particularly as they are records of your <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">PRSI
contributions</a>.</p>

<p>If you are changing job you must inform your new employer of your <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">Personal
Public Service Number (PPS number)</a> as this will ensure that your combined
social insurance contributions are recorded and that your entitlement to
benefits is protected for the future. </p>

<p>If you are an employee, your social insurance contributions are deducted by
your employer and collected by Revenue. A record of the contributions you have
paid is then sent to the Department of Social Protection. If your social
insurance contributions have not been paid you may lose entitlement to a social
welfare benefit or the amount of your pension may be reduced.</p>

<p>If you have worked in another country, your social insurance record in that
country may help you qualify for benefits in Ireland. You can find out about <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/introduction_to_the_irish_system/moving_to_ireland_and_your_social_security_entitlements.html">moving
to Ireland and your social security entitlements</a>. </p>

<h3>Employer’s PRSI obligations </h3>

<p>Your employer is responsible for deducting your social insurance
contribution from your wages and paying it together with the employer’s
contribution to the Revenue. The deduction is written on your pay slip. If the
amount paid to Revenue is not correct the employer is responsible for making up
the deficit. Your employer keeps a record of the insurance contributions you
make and is obliged to give you a P60 at the end of each year and a P45 if you
leave the employment.</p>

<p><span><strong>P45:</strong> </span>If you leave your employment your
employer must give you a <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/paye/guide/p45part1.pdf">P45 (pdf)</a>.
This is a statement of your pay and the tax, <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">Universal
Social Charge (USC)</a> and PRSI to date deducted by your employer. It is an
important document and you need it if:</p>
<ul><li>You are <a shape="rect" href="../../starting_work_and_changing_job/changing_job/change_job_tax_prsi.html">changing
    job</a> – to give to your new employer in order to avoid paying emergency
    tax </li>
  <li>You are unemployed – to claim a tax refund, to claim social welfare
    benefits </li>
</ul><p>If your employer does not give you a P45 you should ask for it. </p>

<p><span><strong>P60:</strong> </span>Your employer must give you a <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/paye/guide/p60.pdf">P60 (pdf)</a>
within 6 weeks of the end of each tax year. It is a statement of your pay and
of the tax, USC and PRSI deducted by your employer during the year. It also
records your Local Property Tax (LPT) deductions (if you choose to have the LPT
deducted from your pay). The P60 is an important document. If you are claiming
a benefit, you would send a copy of it to the Department of Social Protection
as evidence of your paid PRSI contributions. If you are not working on
<strong>31 December</strong> you do not receive a P60 as you would have
received a P45 when you ceased employment. </p>

<p><span><strong>Employer not complying with PRSI
obligations</strong></span></p>

<p>If your employer does not issue you with a P60 or a P45 it may be that you
have not been registered for PRSI by your employer. It also could be that you
have been registered but your employer has not paid the PRSI contributions
which are due or has not paid the correct amount. Under the Social Welfare
(Consolidation) Act 1993 the <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/employer_s_duty_to_pay_social_insurance_prsi.html">employer
is obliged to register all employees for PRSI,</a> pay the correct
contributions, maintain accurate records for all employees and to produce these
records when requested by social welfare inspectors. Failure to do so can
result in penalties, prosecution or both.</p>

<h3>Self-employed</h3>

<p>If you are self-employed you are responsible for paying your social
insurance contributions. As you are not employed the person for whom you are
working is not your employer and is therefore not responsible for paying your
social insurance contributions. The <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/code-of-practice-on-employment-status.pdf">Code
of Practice in determining Employment Status (pdf)</a> contains criteria which
can be used to clarify whether a person is employed or self-employed. The <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/What-does-Scope-Section-do.aspx">Scope
Section of the Department of Social Protection</a> makes the decision if it is
not clear as to whether you are employed or self-employed.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You have a legal right to see the record of your PRSI contributions which is
kept by your employer. You also can ask your employer to give you a statement
of your PRSI contributions once every 3 months. (Normally this is written as a
deduction on your pay slip.)</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/secure/RequestSIContributionRecord.aspx">request
a copy of your social insurance record online</a>. To check your social
insurance record, you will need your PPS number. This number is a unique
identification number which you need when dealing with State agencies.</p>

<p><strong>P45:</strong> If you are not given a P45 when you leave your job you
should first ask your employer for it. If the employer does not supply it you
should contact your tax office. Revenue will contact the employer and obtain
your P45 for you. It must be provided to you in hard copy. If you have started
a new job, Revenue will send you a new tax credit certificate so you will not
have to pay emergency tax in your new job. If you have not been given your P45
and you think that your PRSI contributions have not been paid you should inform
your local social welfare inspector by contacting your <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/List-of-Social-Welfare-Local-and-Branch-Offices-by-County.aspx">local
social welfare office or Intreo centre</a>.</p>

<p><strong>P60:</strong> If your employer does not give you a P60 at the end of
each year you should contact your tax office. Revenue can contact your employer
to obtain your P60 for you. Only an employer can issue a P60. It can be
provided to you either in electronic format or in hard copy. However, Revenue
can provide you with details of the pay and tax for the year in question as
returned by your employer, which Revenue has on file.</p>

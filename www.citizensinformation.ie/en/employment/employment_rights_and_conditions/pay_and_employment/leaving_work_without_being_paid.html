<p>If you lose your job you have certain rights and entitlements including the
right to be paid for work you have done. If you have not been paid by the date
of dismissal or if you are still owed some wages, you have a legal entitlement
to be paid for your work. The non-payment of your wages is a deduction from
your pay by your employer – see 'Deductions from pay' below.</p>

<h3>When you leave work</h3>

<p>On the day your employment ends, that is the date of dismissal, there are
certain things your employer should give you. They include the following:</p>
<ul><li>The pay you are owed and a <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/pay_slip">payslip</a></li>
  <li>A <a href="no_p45_no_p60.html">P45</a> giving details of your pay with
    the tax and PRSI deducted to date</li>
  <li>If you have been made <a href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/overview_redundancy.html">redundant</a>,
    the <a href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/redundancy_payments.html">redundancy
    payment</a> due to you</li>
  <li>Your entitlement to notice and pay for holidays which you have not taken.
    You can read more about these in our document, <a href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/losing_your_job/losing_job_entitlements.html">Losing
    your job – entitlements</a>.</li>
</ul><h3>Deductions from pay</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0025/index.html">Payment
of Wages Act 1991</a> regulates how your employer pays you, establishes your
right to a payslip and states what legal deductions your employer can make from
your pay.</p>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0025/sec0005.html#zza25y1991s5">Section
5 of the Act</a> it is <strong>illegal</strong> for an employer to make a
deduction from an employee’s wages <strong>unless</strong> the deduction
is:</p>
<ul><li>Required by law, for example, <a href="../../starting_work_and_changing_job/starting_work/tax_and_starting_work.html">tax</a>
    (PAYE) and <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social
    insurance</a> (PRSI) </li>
  <li>Provided for in the contract of employment, for example occupational
    pension contributions </li>
  <li>Made with your written consent, for example, trade union subscriptions
  </li>
  <li>To recover an overpayment of wages or expenses </li>
  <li>Required by a court order, for example, an attachment of earnings order
    in a family law case </li>
  <li>Arising due to you being on strike </li>
</ul><h3>Unlawful deductions</h3>

<p>If you have left work and you have not been paid or if your pay is less than
the amount due to you, this is an unlawful deduction under the Payment of Wages
Act. The only exception to this is where the non-payment or missing amount is
due to a mistake in calculating your pay.</p>

<p>So if you have lost your job but your employer has not paid the wages due to
you, you can apply for compensation by making a complaint under the Payment of
Wages Act 1991.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>To make a complaint about this non-payment of wages, you apply to the <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace
Relations Commission</a> using the online complaint form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.
You must make a complaint within 6 months of the date of the deduction which is
the date your wages were due to be paid. The time limit may be extended for up
to a further 6 months, but only where there is a reasonable cause which
prevented the complaint being brought within the normal time limit.</p>

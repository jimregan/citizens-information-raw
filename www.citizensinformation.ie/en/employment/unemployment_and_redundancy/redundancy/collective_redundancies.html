<p>Redundancy situations generally occur where you lose your job due to
circumstances such as the closure of the business or a reduction in the number
of staff. <a shape="rect" href="overview_redundancy.html">Redundancy</a> may
also arise due to the financial position of the firm, lack of work,
re-organisation within the firm or it may be closing down completely. </p>

<p>Collective redundancies arise where, during any period of 30 consecutive
days, the employees being made redundant are:</p>
<ul><li>5 employees where 21-49 are employed </li>
  <li>10 employees where 50-99 are employed </li>
  <li>10% of the employees where 100-299 are employed </li>
  <li>30 employees where 300 or more are employed </li>
</ul><h3>Redundancy Panel</h3>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/act/pub/0027/index.html">Protection
of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Act
2007</a> a Redundancy Panel has been set up by the Department of Jobs,
Enterprise and Innovation in accordance with the partnership agreement
<em>Towards 2016. </em>Some collective redundancies may be referred to the
Panel to determine whether the redundancies were (or are being) carried out in
order to replace the employees with workers on lower pay or other less
favourable terms and conditions. These are known as exceptional collective
redundancies. If the panel decides the redundancies were carried out for this
reason, the employees concerned will be able to take action for unfair
dismissal.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>In such a situation, under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1977/en/act/pub/0007/index.html">Protection
of Employment Acts 1977-2014</a> your employer is obliged to enter into
consultations with a view to agreement with your representatives. This
legislation is separate from the <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1967_0021.htm">Redundancy
Payments Acts 1967â€“2014</a>. These consultations must take place at the
earliest opportunity and at least 30 days before the notice of redundancy is
given. The aim of the consultation is to consider whether there are any
alternatives to the redundancies. </p>

<p>Your employer is also obliged to provide the following information in
writing to your representatives: </p>
<ul><li>The reasons for the redundancy </li>
  <li>The number and descriptions of the employees affected </li>
  <li>The number and descriptions of employees normally employed </li>
  <li>The period in which the redundancies will happen </li>
  <li>The criteria for selection of employees for redundancy </li>
  <li>The method of calculating any redundancy payment. </li>
</ul><p>Your employer is also obliged to inform the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise
and Innovation <strong>in writing</strong> of the proposed redundancies
<strong>at least 30 days before the occurrence of the first
redundancy</strong>. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0009/index.html">Employees
(Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006</a> requires employers to
consult with employees on substantial changes in the workplace, including
proposals for collective redundancies. The Act applies to employers of 50
people or more.</p>

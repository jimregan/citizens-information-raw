<h2>Information</h2>

<p>Redundancy generally occurs where you lose your job due to circumstances
such as the closure of the business or a reduction in the number of staff. The
reason could be the financial position of the firm, lack of work,
reorganisation within the firm or it may be closing down completely.</p>

<p>Redundancy can occur where one of the following things happen: </p>
<ul><li>Your employer ceases to carry on business or ceases to carry on business
    in the place where you have been employed. (For example, if the firm moves
    location, this can be a substantial change in your working conditions and
    may therefore be a reason for redundancy. However if there is a change of
    ownership under the <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/contracts_of_employment/transfer_of_business.html">transfer
    of undertaking</a> legislation where employees are re-employed with no
    change to their working conditions then it is not a redundancy situation.)
  </li>
  <li>Your employer's requirements for employees in your category has ceased or
    diminished </li>
  <li>Your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no
    staff. In deciding whether your employer is continuing the business with
    fewer or no staff, close members of your employer's family are not taken
    into account </li>
  <li>Your employer has decided to let your work be done in a different manner
    in future and you are not sufficiently qualified or trained to do the work
    in the different way </li>
  <li>Your employer has decided that your work will in future be done by
    another person who can do other work as well and you are not sufficiently
    qualified or trained to do that other work. <br></li>
</ul><p>When a number of employees are being made redundant within a 30-day period
this is known as a <a shape="rect" href="collective_redundancies.html">collective redundancy</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes there is a <em>voluntary redundancy</em> situation. This is when
an employer needs to reduce the workforce and asks for some employees to
volunteer for redundancy.</p>

<p>In some cases when you have been in a <a shape="rect" href="lay_off_short_time_working_and_redundancy.html">lay off or short-time
working</a> situation for a certain length of time you may be entitled to claim
redundancy. </p>

<h3>Redundancy entitlements </h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1967_0021.htm">Redundancy
Payments Acts 1967â€“2014</a> provide a minimum entitlement to a redundancy
payment for employees with a set period of service with the employer. Not all
employees are entitled to this statutory redundancy payment, even where a
redundancy situation exists. You can find out more details about <a shape="rect" href="redundancy.html">qualifying for redundancy</a> here.
However, you and your employer may agree a redundancy payment above this
statutory minimum and in such circumstances, employees who have not reached the
statutory minimum period of service may also receive a payment. </p>

<p>If you are being made redundant the legislation specifies what notice must
be given to you and what application forms must be completed - find out more
about <a shape="rect" href="redundancy_procedures.html">redundancy
procedures</a>. </p>

<p>If you are entitled to a redundancy payment there are specific rules about
how your continuity of service is assessed and how the payment is calculated -
you can find out more about <a shape="rect" href="redundancy_payments.html">redundancy payments</a> here. </p>

<p>The Community Services Programme supports community businesses to provide
local services and create employment opportunities for disadvantaged people. It
provides funding support to community companies and co-operatives. It focuses
on communities where public and private sector services are lacking, either
through geographical or social isolation or because demand levels are not
sufficient. The Programme also enables the benefit of other public investment
to be realised (as in the case of investment in community centres and
resources).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pobal.ie/FundingProgrammes/CommunityServicesProgramme/Pages/CSP%20Home.aspx">Community
Services Programme</a> evolved from the Social Economy Programme and is managed
for the Department of Social Protection by Pobal, a not-for-profit company that
manages programmes on behalf of the Irish Government and the EU.</p>

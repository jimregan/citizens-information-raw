<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Jobs-Plus.aspx">JobsPlus</a> is a
employer incentive which encourages and rewards employers who employ jobseekers
on the Live Register. This incentive replaces the Revenue Job Assist and
Employer Job (PRSI) Exemption Scheme from 1 July 2013. It is designed to
encourage employers and businesses to employ people who have been out of work
for long periods. Eligible employers who recruit full-time employees on or
after 1 July 2013 may apply for the incentive.</p>

<p>The Department of Social Protection pays the incentive to the employer
monthly in arrears over a 2-year period. It provides 2 levels of regular cash
payments:</p>
<ul><li>A payment of €7,500 for each person recruited who has been unemployed
    for more than 12 but less than 24 months - see 'JobsPlus for young people'
    below</li>
  <li>A payment of €10,000 for each person recruited who has been unemployed
    for more than 24 months</li>
</ul><h3>JobsPlus Youth</h3>

<p>Since 1 January 2015, under the JobsPlus Youth part of the scheme, the
qualifying period for JobsPlus for jobseekers aged under 25 has been reduced to
4 months. It remains at 12 months for other jobseekers. Eligible young people
will be given certification that they qualify for the JobsPlus subsidy and they
can use this when applying for jobs.</p>

<h3>Employees</h3>

<p>Eligible employees must:</p>
<ul><li>Be getting <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker’s
    Benefit (JB)</a>, <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s
    Allowance (JA)</a>, <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance_transition.html">Jobseeker's
    Transitional payment (JST)</a> or <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">signing
    on for credits</a>.</li>
</ul><p>And</p>
<ul><li>Be at least 12 months* (312 days) on the Live Register in the previous 18
    months to qualify as an eligible employee for the €7,500 incentive. The
    qualifying period is 4 months (104 days) for young people aged under 25.

</ul><p>*Periods spent on <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/JobsPlus-Employers.aspx#q15">certain
activation schemes</a>, or time spent in prison may count this time towards the
qualifying period once entitlement to one of the qualifying payments outlined

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<h3>Employers</h3>

<p>If an employer decides to recruit an additional employee, they can log on to
jobsplus.ie and complete an <a href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/secure/jobsplus-employer.aspx">online
application form</a> giving, for example, the name of company, size of
workforce, bank details and economic sector of company. Once this is submitted
an officer of the Department of Social Protection (DSP) will review and check
the tax clearance certificate is in order and email the employer if it is
approved.</p>

<p>Once eligibility is confirmed by the DSP an employer may start to recruit,
either by contacting their <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Intreo---Contact-Information.aspx">local
Intreo centre</a> or <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Employment-Services-Offices.aspx">employment
services office</a> for details of suitably experienced and qualified
candidates for their vacancy. They could also <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Register-a-vacancy_holder.aspx">register
the vacancy with Jobs Ireland</a>.</p>

<h3>Candidate employees</h3>

<p>Once preliminary interviews have been conducted and candidates have been
shortlisted employers should then ask these candidates to log on to jobsplus.ie
to <a href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/secure/jobsplus-employee.aspx">check
their eligibility for JobsPlus.</a> The DSP will process their request and
verify eligibility by posting a two-part JP1 form to the candidate. Part A of
the JP1 form will confirm the employee’s eligibility and rate of payment for
a prospective employer, Part B is to be completed by the employer if they
choose to employ the candidate. The candidate should bring the two-part JP1
form confirming eligibility to the employer for consideration.</p>

<p>When an employer identifies the most suitable candidate for the position,
they should complete part B of the JP1 form for that candidate, sign the
declaration and return to the DSP. The JP1 form will be processed by the
Department and once all conditions are satisfied employers will be notified by
e-mail that they have been awarded the incentive with regard to the employee
specified on the JP1 form.</p>

<p>Once the candidate is offered a position they should contact the DSP to
close their jobseeker’s claim. This can be done on line at <a href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/secure/CloseClaim.aspx">welfare.ie</a> or
by contacting their local Intreo Centre or social welfare office. Payment of
JobsPlus can only start once the DSP confirms that the new employee’s
jobseeker claim has closed.</p>

<h3>Review</h3>

<p>If the application is refused the employer can request a review of the
decision by a higher officer in the Department of Social Protection.</p>

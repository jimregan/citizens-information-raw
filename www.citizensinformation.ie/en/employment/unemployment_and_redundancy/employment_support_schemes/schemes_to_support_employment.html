<p>There is a range of employment schemes and other supports which encourage
long-term unemployed people to return to work. They are aimed at people who
have been on unemployment or certain other social welfare payments for a
specific period of time. Some schemes fund community and voluntary
organisations to provide employment opportunities which benefit the local
community. Each scheme has different rules as to who is eligible so it is
important to check the detailed information about each scheme. If you are
returning to work through one of these schemes your social welfare payment may
be affected in different ways, depending on the scheme. <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_and_work/disability_payments_and_work.html">People
on certain disability payments</a> may qualify for the schemes and there are a
number of <a href="../../employment_and_disability/">employment supports for
people with disabilities.</a></p>

<p><strong>Childcare:</strong> If you take up a place on a Department of Social
Protection employment programme (except Community Employment), you may be
eligible for the <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_and_work/afterschool_childcare_scheme.html">After-School
Child Care (ASCC) scheme.</a> There is a separate <a href="../../../education/pre_school_education_and_childcare/community_employment_childcare_programme.html">Community
Employment Childcare (CEC) Programme</a> for people who need childcare to take
up a place on a Community Employment scheme.</p>

<p><strong>Budget 2016:</strong> It was announced that from January 2016 there
will be an increase of €2.50 per week in top-up payments paid towards meals
and travel costs for Community Employment , Rural Social Scheme, Gateway, Job
Initiative, Tús and JobBridge participants.</p>

<h3>Back to Work Enterprise Allowance<br></h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_and_work/back_to_work_enterprise_allowance.html">Back
to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA)</a> scheme assists <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/">unemployed
people</a> and others getting certain social welfare payments to become
self-employed. People who are setting up their own business and who qualify for
the BTWEA scheme may retain a percentage of their social welfare payment for up
to 2 years.</p>

<h3>Short-Term Enterprise Allowance</h3>

<p>The <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_and_work/short_term_enterprise_allowance.html">Short-Term
Enterprise Allowance (STEA)</a> provides support to people getting Jobseeker's
Benefit (JB) who want to start their own business. The Short-Term Enterprise
Allowance is paid instead of your JB and there is no qualifying period, which
means you do not need to be getting JB for a certain length of time.</p>

<h3>Part-time Job Incentive</h3>

<p>The Part-time Job Incentive (PTJI) scheme is for people who have been
getting Jobseeker’s Allowance for 15 months or more. It allows them to take

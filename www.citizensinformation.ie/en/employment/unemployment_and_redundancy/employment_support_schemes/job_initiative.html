<p>The Job Initiative Scheme is a programme providing full-time employment for
people 35 years of age or over who have been unemployed for 5 years or more.
Since <span>November 2004</span>, there has been <span>no further recruitment
onto the Scheme</span>. Instead, you are invited to consider applying for
available <a shape="rect" href="community_employment_scheme.html">Community
Employment</a> vacancies. The following information therefore <span>only
applies</span> to those <span>currently employed</span> under the Job
Initiative Scheme.</p>

<p>In order to qualify, you must have been in receipt of an appropriate social
welfare payment over that 5-year period. The aim of the Job Initiative
programme is to assist long-term unemployed persons to prepare for work
opportunities in the open labour market. The programme does this by providing
participants with work experience, training and development opportunities. The
same employment conditions apply to the Scheme as in other jobs. For example,
you have the same employment rights and protections regarding <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/annual_leave_public_holidays.html">annual
leave</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/sick_leave.html">sick
leave</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/maternity_leave.html">maternity
leave</a>, grievance or disciplinary procedures and your income is taxable.</p>

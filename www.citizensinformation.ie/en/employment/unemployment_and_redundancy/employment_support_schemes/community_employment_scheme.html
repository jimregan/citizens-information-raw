<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Community Employment (CE) programme is designed to help people who are
long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged people to get back to work by
offering part-time and temporary placements in jobs based within local
communities. Participants can take up other part-time work during their
placement. After the placement, participants are encouraged to seek permanent
part-time and full-time jobs elsewhere based on the experience and new skills
they have gained while in a Community Employment scheme. The Community
Employment programme is administered by the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Community-Employment-Programme-.aspx">Department
of Social Protection (DSP)</a>.</p>

<p>Community Employment sponsors - the voluntary organisations or public bodies
that manage CE schemes - plan and manage CE placements. They sponsor <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Eligibility---Projects.aspx">local or
community projects that meet an identified community need.</a> </p>

<p>Since 2013 there is a <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/SW138.aspx">CE
Childcare Training and Development Programme</a> for CE participants who wish
to pursue a career in childcare. It is a <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/What-will-participation-on-the-programme-involve.aspx">3-year
programme</a> of formal learning and work experience leading to a NFQ Level 5
qualification in early childhood care and education.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l510a8">Participants</h2>

<p>There are 2 different categories of Community Employment (CE), each with its
own set of eligibility requirements. These are the Part-time Integration Option
and the Part-time Job Option. You can participate in either of these options
but not in both at the same time. There is a maximum time limit for Community
Employment participation of 3 years, subject to DSP approval. It is possible to
re-qualify for CE after 12 months on a qualifying payment. An overall lifetime
limit of 6 years applies to all CE participants. If you are getting one of the
specified disability payments you may be eligible for an additional year’s
participation. Time spent on CE before 1 January 2007 is not counted in these
participation limits.</p>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pressoffice/Pages/pr031215.aspx">a
pilot scheme which started on 4 January 2016</a> new and existing CE
participants aged 62 and over may be eligible to participate on Community
Employment continuously until they reach State pension age. This scheme, called
the Service Support Stream, was extended and is to be reviewed in 2017.</p>

<h3>Part-time Integration Option</h3>

<p>The CE Part-time Integration Option allows you to work under the Community
Employment scheme for a maximum of 1 year. It may be possible to have your
one-year placement extended, subject to DSP approval and the availability of
places and budget. Generally participants complete their one-year placement and
then seek a permanent full-time or part-time job elsewhere. </p>

  <li><p>If you were getting Carer's Allowance this can also count towards the
    eligibility period but your caring responsibilities must have ceased and
    you must currently be getting either JA, JB. JST or OFP.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Those getting JB or JA are allowed a maximum of 30 worked days in each of
    the qualifying years before starting a CE scheme when assessing
  eligibility.</li>
  <li>Time spent on one of the above disability payments can count towards the
    eligibility period, provided there is no break, for example, 3 months on
    Illness Benefit followed immediately by 9 months on Jobseeker’s Allowance
    or 12 months on Illness Benefit followed immediately by 24 months on
    Jobseeker’s Allowance.</li>
  <li>Time spent on CE no longer counts towards continued time on CE for new
    participants who start on or after 8 October 2012</li>
  <li>Generally, time spent on Tús, Gateway, Rural Social Scheme, JobBridge,
    Back to Education Allowance or Springboard will not count towards the
    eligibility period. There are some exceptions and you can read more about
    these and the other eligibility requirements for the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Part-time-Integration-Option.aspx">Part-time
    Integration Option</a> and the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Part-time-Job-Option.aspx">Part-time
    Job Option</a> on welfare.ie.</li>
</ul><h3>Swap with qualified adult </h3>

<p>The spousal swap option is no longer open to new CE participants since 16
September 2013. People currently availing of a swap with a qualified adult are
not affected. </p>

<h3>Working on a CE scheme</h3>

<p>The average number of working hours for placements is 39 hours per
fortnight. You are paid weekly by your sponsor and have certain statutory
employment rights including <a href="../../employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/annual_leave_public_holidays.html">annual
leave,</a> <a href="../../employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/public_holidays_in_ireland.html">public
holidays</a>, <a href="../../employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/maternity_leave.html">maternity
leave</a> and a <a href="../../employment_rights_and_conditions/contracts_of_employment/contract_of_employment.html">written
statement of your terms and conditions of employment.</a> Tax may be deducted
from your pay if applicable but your CE pay is exempt from the <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">Universal
Social Charge</a>. CE participants pay PRSI at Class A8/A9 which counts as a
full Class A contribution. If your CE payment is less than €352 a week you do
not pay any employee contribution. If your CE payment is over €352 a week you
pay an employee PRSI contribution. More information is available in the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Procedures-Manual.aspx">Community
Employment Procedures Manual.</a></p>

<p><strong>Age limit:</strong> Funding is not provided for CE participants who
have reached the qualifying age for a State pension, that is:</p>
<ul><li>66 for those born before 1 January 1955</li>
  <li>67 for those born on or after 1 January 1955</li>
  <li>68 for those born on or after 1 January 1961</li>
</ul><p><strong>Childcare:</strong> If you need childcare in order to become a CE
participant, you may be eligible for the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pressoffice/Pages/pr080714.aspx">Community
Employment Childcare (CEC) programme.</a> It provides subsidised childcare
places for children up to the age of 13. You should contact your sponsor for
more details about the CEC programme.</p>

<h3>Social welfare payments</h3>

<p>Since 16 January 2012 new participants on Community Employment (CE) schemes
cannot claim another social welfare payment at the same time. New participants
are people who have not been employed on a CE scheme in the previous 12 months.
</p>

<p>Existing participants on One-Parent Family Payment, Deserted Wife's Benefit,
disability payments and widow’s, widower’s or surviving civil partner’s
pensions will continue to get their social welfare payment until they are no
longer eligible to participate in a CE scheme or they leave the scheme
voluntarily. </p>

<p><strong>Qualified child increases:</strong> Since 20 February 2012 if a
person is on a CE scheme and getting One-Parent Family Payment, Deserted Wife's
Benefit or Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory
Pension, payment of 2 qualified child increases ceased for both new and
existing participants. Existing participants get the qualified child increase
on their social welfare payment and get the personal rate for a CE participant.
New CE participants get the qualified child increase with their CE payment.</p>

<p><strong>Other payments and CE</strong>: If you get a place on a CE scheme
and your spouse or partner is claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JA), Disability
Allowance (DA) or Farm Assist in their own right, they can claim an Increase
for a Qualified Adult with their JA, DA or Farm Assist. Your income from the CE
scheme (as a single person) is then assessed as insurable employment against
their payment.</p>

<p><strong>Extra benefits</strong></p>

<p>You will retain your medical card. </p>

<p>You will retain an entitlement to the extra benefits you were receiving
immediately before going onto Community Employment provided you continue to
satisfy the conditions for these benefits.</p>

<p>The amount of <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a> which you get may be reduced. You may be able to keep part of
your <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/mortgage_interest_supplement.html">Mortgage
Interest Supplement</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The Department of Social Protection offers grants to sponsors towards the
cost of hiring people under the scheme. </p>

<p>The minimum weekly payment for new participants based on 19.5 hours worked
is €215.50 with effect from 13 March 2017.</p>

<p><strong>From March 2017,</strong> if the actual social welfare payment
(including dependants) you were getting was <strong>€193 a week or
less</strong>, then you will get the minimum CE weekly rate of
<strong>€215.50</strong> (that is €193 plus €22.50). If your actual
weekly social welfare payment (including dependants) was <strong>€193.01 or
more,</strong> then you will get the <strong>equivalent rate plus</strong>
<strong>€22.50</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Additional income:</strong> If you have any additional income, for
example, from part-time work, it will not affect your CE payment. However, the
rules on change of circumstances that apply to your original social welfare
payment also apply to your CE payment. For example, if your qualified adult
gets a job, their income will be assessed as means and your CE payment may be
reduced. Your CE payment cannot be reduced below the minimum rate of €215.50.
</p>

<p>In order to avoid any possible overpayments, if there is any change in your
circumstances, you should immediately inform your CE supervisor and the local
DSP Community Development Officer responsible for your CE scheme. (Your CE
supervisor will give you contact details for the local DSP Community
Development Officer.) There is more information about change of circumstances
in section 3.2.6 of the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Procedures-Manual.aspx">Community
Employment Procedures Manual</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Spouses or partners and CE:</strong> If you are on a CE scheme and
your spouse or partner gets a place on a CE scheme, you will each get a single
rate of the CE payment together with half of the Increases for a Qualified
Child for any dependent children.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>There are a limited number of Community Employment (CE) places available. If
you want to participate in a CE scheme contact your local Intreo Centre for
information about CE job opportunities. <a href="https://www.jobsireland.ie/">Job listings are also available online.</a>
</p>

<p>Voluntary organisations and public bodies may <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Sponsoring-.aspx">sponsor CE projects</a>
which are for community and public benefit. They should contact their local
Intreo Centre for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Leaving and re-entry to Community Employment</strong></p>

<p>If you leave a CE scheme, you cannot participate in another CE scheme for 12
months after you leave and you must be getting a qualifying payment for those
12 months. If you are being re-engaged, that is, if you are continuing for
another year on your CE scheme, you are not required to have this 12-month
break. </p>

<p>If you have the opportunity of full-time work you can take one period of
temporary unpaid leave with your sponsor’s agreement for up to 26 weeks. If
the work opportunity continues beyond 26 weeks, you must leave the CE scheme.

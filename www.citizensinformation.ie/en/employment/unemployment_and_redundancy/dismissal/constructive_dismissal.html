<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Constructive dismissal arises where you terminate your contract of
employment, with or without prior notice, due to the conduct of your employer.
Your employer's conduct however must have been such that it would have been
reasonable for you to terminate your contract without giving notice.</p>

<p>If you are dismissed you may, under certain conditions, bring a claim for <a shape="rect" href="unfair_dismissal.html">unfair dismissal</a> against your
employer. If you do this and your employer accepts that there was a dismissal,
it will be for your employer to show that there were <a shape="rect" href="fair_grounds_for_dismissal.html">fair grounds for the dismissal</a>.
Generally a dismissal is presumed to be unfair unless your employer can show
substantial grounds to justify it.</p>

<p>However, if you terminate your employment and you claim constructive
dismissal under the <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1977_0010.htm">Unfair
Dismissals Acts 1977â€“2015</a> it will be for you to prove that your
resignation was justified.</p>

<p>If you are found to have been unfairly dismissed you may be placed back in
your job or more commonly, you may receive compensation for the loss of
earnings caused by the dismissal. <br></p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>In general, you must have 12 months' continuous service with your employer
to bring a claim for unfair dismissal. Under the unfair dismissals legislation
in certain cases the 12 months' service is not a requirement.</p>

<p>If you wish to make a claim you should do so within 6 months of the date of
the termination of employment. This time limit may be extended to 12 months in
cases where exceptional circumstances have prevented the lodgement of the claim
within 6 months.</p>

<p>You are entitled to regard your contract as terminated if:</p>
<ul><li>Your employer's conduct amounts to an actual breach of the contract of
    employment or, although it falls short of such a breach, is serious enough
    to warrant your resignation </li>
  <li>Your employer's conduct shows that they no longer intend to be bound by
    one or more of the essential terms of the contract </li>
  <li>Your employer has acted unreasonably </li>
</ul><p>Conduct by fellow employees that goes unchecked by your employer may also be
taken into account in relation to constructive dismissal.</p>

<p>You should also note the following points:</p>
<ul><li>In a constructive dismissal situation it is for you to prove that your
    resignation was justified </li>
  <li>You should use any complaints or <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Good_Workplace_Relations/codes_practice/COP3/">grievance
    procedure</a> that is available to you before resigning </li>
  <li>You should also consider using any outside industrial relations
    procedures available to you before resigning </li>
  <li>You should seek detailed advice before leaving as this is a complex area
    of law </li>
  <li>You should only resign as a last resort after having used all available
    means of resolving the problem </li>
</ul></div>

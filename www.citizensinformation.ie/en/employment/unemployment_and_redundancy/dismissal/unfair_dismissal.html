<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1977_0010.htm">Unfair
Dismissals Acts 1977–2015</a> circumstances in which unfair dismissal can
occur are where:</p>
<ul><li>Your employer terminates your contract of employment, with or without
    notice or </li>
  <li>You terminate your contract of employment, with or without notice, due to
    the conduct of your employer. This is known as <a shape="rect" href="constructive_dismissal.html">constructive dismissal</a> </li>
</ul><p>If you are dismissed from your employment, you may, under certain
conditions, bring a claim for unfair dismissal against your employer. The
unfair dismissals legislation does not actually protect you from dismissal,
rather it provides a system of appeal whereby you can question the fairness of
your dismissal after it has occurred.</p>

<p>You will have to show that you qualify to bring a claim under the
legislation - see 'Rules' below. If you do this and your employer accepts that
there was a dismissal, it will be for your employer to show that there were <a shape="rect" href="fair_grounds_for_dismissal.html">fair grounds for the
dismissal</a>. Apart from a case involving constructive dismissal, a dismissal
is presumed to be unfair unless your employer can show substantial grounds to
justify it. </p>

<p>Under the legislation you may ask your employer for a written statement of
the reasons for your dismissal. Your employer should provide this within 14
days of your request.</p>

<p>If you are found to have been unfairly dismissed you may be placed back in
your job or, more commonly, you may receive compensation for the loss of
earnings caused by the dismissal. </p>

<h3>Unfair dismissals</h3>

<p>A dismissal is considered to be automatically unfair if the employee is
dismissed for any of the following reasons:</p>
<ul><li>Membership or proposed membership of a trade union or engaging in trade
    union activities, whether within permitted times during work or outside of
    working hours </li>
  <li>Religious or political opinions </li>
  <li>Legal proceedings against an employer where an employee is a party or a
    witness </li>
  <li>Race, colour, sexual orientation, age or membership of the Traveller
    community </li>
  <li>Pregnancy, giving birth or breastfeeding or any matters connected with
    pregnancy or birth </li>
  <li>Availing of rights under legislation to <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/maternity_leave.html">maternity
    leave</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/adoptive_leave.html">adoptive
    leave,</a> <a href="../../employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/paternity_leave.html">paternity
    leave</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/carers_leave_from_employment.html">carer's
    leave</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/parental_leave.html">parental
    </a>or <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/types_of_leave_from_work.html">force
    majeure</a> leave </li>
  <li>Unfair selection for redundancy </li>
  <li>Making a protected disclosure under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0014/index.html">Protected
    Disclosures Act 2014</a> </li>
</ul><h3>Redundancy </h3>

<p>Under the unfair dismissals legislation, <a shape="rect" href="../redundancy/redundancy.html">redundancy</a> is considered to be a fair
ground for dismissal. However although a redundancy situation exists, you may
have grounds for complaint if the manner of your selection for redundancy was
unfair. You may qualify to bring a claim for unfair dismissal if you consider
that you were unfairly selected for redundancy or consider that a genuine
redundancy situation did not exist – see ‘How to apply’ below. Unless
your employer can prove there was a <a shape="rect" href="../redundancy/overview_redundancy.html">genuine redundancy situation</a>
and that <a shape="rect" href="../redundancy/redundancy_procedures.html">fair
procedures</a> were followed, your dismissal may be found to be unfair. If you
make a claim for unfair dismissal, you cannot also claim redundancy.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>In order to <strong>qualify to bring a claim for unfair dismissal</strong>
under the legislation the following requirements must be met: </p>

<h3>Time limit </h3>

<p>The time limit for beginning a claim for unfair dismissal is 6 months from
the date of the dismissal. If there is <em>reasonable cause</em> you may be
allowed to extend this period up to 12 months from the date of dismissal.
However, this must be reasonable cause - saying you did not know the law will
not suffice. </p>

<p>The date of dismissal, under the unfair dismissals legislation, is the date
on which the notice to which you are entitled expires. You are entitled to a <a shape="rect" href="../losing_your_job/losing_job_entitlements.html">statutory
minimum period of notice </a>if you have worked at least 13 weeks for your
employer. Your written contract of employment may provide for a longer period
of notice. </p>

<h3>Service </h3>

<p>Normally you must have at least 12 months' continuous service with your
employer in order to bring a claim for unfair dismissal. However there are
important exceptions to this general rule. If you have less than 12 months'
continuous service you may bring a claim for unfair dismissal if you are
dismissed for: </p>
<ul><li>Trade union membership or activity </li>
  <li>Pregnancy, giving birth or breastfeeding or any matters connected with
    pregnancy or birth </li>
  <li>Availing of rights granted by the Maternity Protection Acts 1994 and
    2004, the Adoptive Leave Acts 1995 and 2005, the Paternity Leave and
    Benefit Act 2016 the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, the Parental Leave
    Acts 1998 and 2006 and the Carer's Leave Act 2001 </li>
  <li>Making a protected disclosure under the Protected Disclosures Act
  2014</li>
</ul><p>Note: <a href="http://www.ihrec.ie/publications/list/ihrec-employment-equality-rights-explained/">employment
equality legislation</a> prohibits dismissal based on any of the following 9
grounds for discrimination: gender, civil status, family status, age,
disability, religious belief, race, sexual orientation or membership of the
Traveller community. So, for example, if you have been employed for less than a
year you may not be able to bring a claim under the unfair dismissals
legislation, but you may be able make a complaint of discriminatory dismissal -
see 'How to apply' below.</p>

<p>In general, the continuity of an employee's employment is only broken by the
dismissal of the employee by the employer or the termination of the employment
by the employee. </p>

<h3>Employment status </h3>

<p>You must be an employee, working under a contract of service. The essential
element of such a contract is that the relationship is one of
employer/employee, as opposed to a contract for services where the relationship
involves performing a service in return for payment, that is, a contractor. In
the case of <a shape="rect" href="../../types_of_employment/full_time_employment/agency_workers.html">agency
employees</a>, for the purpose of redress under the Acts, the employer is the
person or organisation for whom the employee is actually working. </p>

<h3>The fact of dismissal </h3>

<p>You must have been dismissed in order to bring a claim. The one exception to
this is the concept of constructive dismissal where you resign but claim that
your employer's conduct towards you forced your resignation. </p>

<p>If your employer disputes that a dismissal actually took place, you will
have to establish that it did. Only then will your claim continue to the next
stage of deciding whether the dismissal was fair, which is a matter for your
employer to prove.</p>

<h3>Excluded categories</h3>

<p>The Acts do not apply to the following: <br>
(a) an employee who is under 16, or who has reached normal retiring age or who
is not covered by the Redundancy Payments Acts because of age <br>
(b) a person working for a close relative in a private house or farm, provided
both also live in the same house or farm; <br>
(c) a member of the Defence Forces <br>
(d) a member of the Garda Síochána (since 4 July 2006, the Acts apply to most
State employees)<br>
(e) a person undergoing full-time training or apprenticeship <br>
(f) an officer of education and training boards, a county or city manager and
the chief executive of the Health Service Executive<br>
(g) an employee who is employed under a <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/contracts_of_employment/fixed_term_or_specified_purpose_contracts.html">fixed-term/specified-purpose
contract</a> and where the contract is in writing, is signed by both parties
and contains a clause that the Acts shall not apply in relation to a dismissal
consisting only of the expiration of the fixed term contract or the completion
of the specified purpose. You can find out detailed information about
fixed-term/specified-purpose contracts and dismissal in 'Further information'
below.<br>
(h) an employee who works outside the State (unless the employee is resident in
the State for the duration of the contract or is domiciled in the State and the
employer is resident in the State for the duration of the contract) <br>
(i) statutory apprentices who are dismissed within 6 months after beginning
apprenticeship or within one month after the completion of the apprenticeship
<br>
(j) an employee who is on probation or undergoing training at the beginning of
employment, provided that the duration of probation or training is one year or
less and is specified in the written contract of employment <br>
(k) an employee who is dismissed during training for qualification or
registration as a nurse or for other specified para-medical employment </p>

<p>Note: The exclusions from the Acts of persons referred to in points (b),
(e), (i), (j) and (k) shall not apply where the dismissal results from: </p>
<ul><li>The employee's pregnancy, giving birth or breastfeeding </li>
  <li>Availing of rights under the Maternity Protection Acts 1994 and 2004 </li>
  <li>Availing of rights to adoptive leave or additional adoptive leave,
    paternity leave, parental leave, force majeure leave or carer's leave </li>
</ul><p>The exclusion from the Acts of persons referred to in points (a) and (d)
shall not apply where the dismissal results from the employee availing of the
right to parental leave, force majeure leave or carer's leave. </p>

<p>The exclusion from the Acts of persons referred to in points (d) and (e)
shall not apply where the dismissal results from the employee making a
protected disclosure.</p>

<p>The Unfair Dismissals Acts will not apply to a dismissal where the
employee's employer at the commencement of the employment informs the employee
in writing that the employment will terminate on the return to work with that
employer of another employee who is absent from work while on maternity leave,
adoptive leave, paternity leave or carer's leave. </p>

<h3>Redress </h3>

<p>If you are successful in your claim for unfair dismissal, the body that
heard your claim may award you one of the following remedies: </p>
<strong>Reinstatement</strong> 

<p>This means that you are treated as if you had never been dismissed. Not only
are you entitled to loss of earnings from the date of the dismissal to the date
of the hearing, you are also entitled to any favourable changes in the terms of
employment during that period, for example, pay rises. This remedy is rarely
used. </p>
<strong>Re-engagement</strong> <br><p>This means that you will be given your job back but only from a particular
date, for example, the date of the decision in your favour. This means that you
will not be entitled to compensation for any loss of earnings. Often this
remedy is used where it is felt that the employee contributed to the dismissal,
even though the actual dismissal was unfair. Again, however, this remedy is
rarely used. </p>
<strong>Compensation</strong> <br><p>This is the most common remedy. It is essential to note that compensation is
only awarded in respect of financial loss. Generally, the maximum compensation
is 2 years’ pay. If you were dismissed for making a protected disclosure, the
maximum is 5 years’ pay. You cannot claim any compensation for such matters
as injury to your feelings or stress caused by the dismissal. Compensation will
take the following matters into account: </p>
<ul><li>Present loss - a calculation of your loss of earnings from the date of
    the dismissal to the hearing of your claim. Any money earned by you during
    this period will be deducted, as will any payment in lieu of notice
    received by you when you were dismissed. You are also obliged to lessen
    your losses during the period from your dismissal to the hearing by being
    available for and seeking alternative employment. If it transpires that you
    have no actual loss, because, for example, you took up other employment
    immediately after your dismissal, you are entitled to a token compensation
    of 4 weeks' pay. </li>
  <li>Future loss - a calculation will be made as to your future loss, based on
    a consideration of how long it is likely to be before you can get
    alternative work. </li>
  <li>Pension loss - a calculation that will try to assess what impact the
    unfair dismissal has had on your pension entitlements. </li>
  <li>Loss of statutory protection - a calculation dealing with the point that
    you will have lost protection under the unfair dismissals, redundancy and
    minimum notice legislation. </li>
  <li>Contributory conduct - a calculation that will take into account any
    conduct by you that contributed to the dismissal, even though it was an
    unfair dismissal. The degree of contribution will be stated in percentage
    terms and your award overall award reduced accordingly. </li>
</ul></div>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you wish to make a claim for unfair dismissal you should do so within 6
months of the date of dismissal. This time limit may be extended to 12 months
if there was "reasonable cause" for the delay.</p>

<h3>Fixed-term or specified-purpose contracts and dismissal </h3>

<p>A fixed-term contract is a contract of a specific length where the duration
of the contract is known to both parties from the outset. A specified-purpose
contract is also of a limited duration, but the parties do not know the length
of the contract from the outset. It will be envisaged that it is of limited
duration to end when the specified purpose of the contract is completed. </p>

<p>When an employee is dismissed at the end of a fixed-term or
specified-purpose contract the unfair dismissals legislation applies as normal
unless the employer has availed of the provision to exclude the operation of
the legislation. The 3 conditions to be met in order to bring this exclusion
into play are: </p>
<ul><li>The contract must be in writing and must set out the specific duration of
    the fixed-term contract or, in the case of a specified-purpose contract,
    the object of the contract. </li>
  <li>The contract must be signed by both the employee and the employer </li>
  <li>The contract must contain a specific clause stating that the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1977/en/act/pub/0010/index.html">Unfair
    Dismissals Acts</a> will not apply to the expiry of the term of the
    contract </li>
</ul><p>If these conditions are not met then you may have a claim for unfair
dismissal despite the fact that you are employed under a fixed-term or
specified-purpose contract, subject to fulfilling the normal requirements as to
length of service, etc. <br>
Under the <a href="http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Guide_-_Protection_of_Employees_Fixed-term_Work_Act.pdf">Protection
Of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 (pdf)</a>, if an employee is required
to enter into a number of such fixed-term or specified-purpose contracts there
are two possible situations as follows: </p>
<ul><li><strong>Employees on fixed-term contracts which commenced prior to the
    passing of the Act:</strong> Once such an employee completes or has
    completed 3 years' continuous employment (any or all of the 3 years'
    service may have occurred prior to the passing of the Act) the employer may
    renew the contract for a fixed term on one occasion only and that renewal
    may be for a period of no longer than one year </li>
  <li><strong>Employees on a fixed-term employment contract which commenced
    after the passing of the Act:</strong> Where such an employee is employed
    by his or her employer or associated employer on two or more continuous
    fixed-term contracts, the aggregate duration of those contracts may not
    exceed 4 years. </li>
</ul><p>However, the above-mentioned rules do not apply where there are objective
grounds justifying the renewal of a contract of employment for a fixed term
only. </p>

<p>Where a renewal of a fixed-term contract does not comply with the above
requirements and cannot be objectively justified, the contract is treated as an
open-ended contract. </p>

<p>The Unfair Dismissal Acts contain a provision aimed at ensuring that
successive temporary contracts are not used in order to avoid that legislation.
Where a fixed-term or specified-purpose contract expires and the individual is
re-employed within 3 months, the individual is deemed to have continuous
service. </p>

<p>Therefore, even where an employer excludes the unfair dismissals legislation
in the manner described above, an <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/rights_commissioner.html">adjudicator</a>
will consider whether the use of such contracts was wholly or partly to avoid
the employee having the protection of the unfair dismissals legislation. If it
is considered that this was the case and the contracts were not separated by
more than 3 months and the job was at least similar, then the case can be dealt
with as if there was continuous employment and the employer will be required to
justify the dismissal in the normal manner. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>It is widely recognised that losing your job can be one of the most
difficult times of your life. This document is an introduction to the range of
issues that you need to consider when you lose your job.</p>

<h3>Dismissal and redundancy </h3>

<p>If you lose your job you may have been made <a shape="rect" href="../redundancy/overview_redundancy.html">redundant</a> or you may have
been dismissed. If it is a redundancy situation you may qualify for a <a shape="rect" href="../redundancy/redundancy_payments.html">redundancy
payment</a>. You can find out how <a shape="rect" href="../../retirement/income_tax_in_retirement/retirement_lump_sum_taxation.html">your
redundancy payment is taxed</a>. If you have been let go from your job, you
should check that your employer had <a shape="rect" href="../dismissal/fair_grounds_for_dismissal.html">fair grounds for your
dismissal</a>. If you are concerned about your dismissal you should find out
more about your rights under <a shape="rect" href="../dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfair dismissals legislation.</a>
When you lose your job you are entitled to <a shape="rect" href="losing_job_entitlements.html">notice</a> and you may also be entitled to
payment in lieu of wages and for holidays.</p>

<h3>PRSI and tax</h3>

<p>When you lose your job you should register as unemployed with your <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/List-of-Social-Welfare-Local-and-Branch-Offices-by-County.aspx">local
social welfare office or Intreo centre</a> even if you do not qualify for an
unemployment payment. You may be able to sign on for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">credited
PRSI contributions</a> so that you do not have a break in your social insurance
record.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to a <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/tax_refund_when_unemployed_or_out_of_work_sick.html">tax
refund</a> if you have been out of work for some time. When you leave your job
<a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/no_p45_no_p60.html">your
employer should give you your P45</a> which is a record of your tax and PRSI
paid. If it is the end of a tax year your employer should give you a P60.</p>

<h3>Social welfare and other benefits.</h3>

<p>You may be entitled to an unemployment social welfare payment. If you have
enough social insurance contributions you may be entitled to <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker’s
Benefit.</a> If you do not have enough PRSI contributions you may qualify for
<a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s
Allowance</a> which is a means-tested benefit. Depending on your circumstances
you may qualify for a <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical
card</a> or <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/gp_visit_cards.html">GP visit
card</a> and other secondary benefits such as <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The main legislation providing for the health and safety of people in the
workplace are the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0010/index.html">Safety,
Health and Welfare at Work Acts 2005 and 2010</a>. They apply to all employers,
employees (including fixed-term and temporary employees) and self-employed
people in their workplaces. The Acts set out the rights and obligations of both
employers and employees and provides for substantial fines and penalties for
breaches of the health and safety legislation.</p>

<p><strong>(General Application) Regulations 2007:</strong> Almost all of the
specific health and safety laws which apply generally to all employments are
contained in the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/si/0299.html">Safety, Health and
Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007</a>. You can find them
and other relevant regulations on <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Legislation/Acts/Safety_Health_and_Welfare_at_Work/Safety_Health_and_Welfare_at_Work_Act.html#regulations">hsa.ie.</a></p>

<h3><a>Employer’s duties</a></h3>

<p>Under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0010/sec0008.html#partii-chapi-sec8%20">Section
8</a> of the Act the employer has a duty to ensure the employees’ safety,
health and welfare at work as far as is reasonably practicable. In order to
prevent workplace injuries and ill health the employer is required, among other
things, to: </p>
<ul><li>Provide and maintain a safe workplace which uses safe plant and equipment
  </li>
  <li>Prevent risks from use of any article or substance and from exposure to
    physical agents, noise and vibration </li>
  <li>Prevent any improper conduct or behaviour likely to put the safety,
    health and welfare of employees at risk </li>
  <li>Provide instruction and training to employees on health and safety </li>
  <li>Provide protective clothing and equipment to employees </li>
  <li>Appointing a competent person as the organisation’s Safety Officer </li>
</ul><h3>Employees’ duties</h3>

<p>The duties of employees while at work are set out in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0010/sec0013.html#partii-chapii-sec13">Section
13</a> of the Act. These include the following:</p>
<ul><li>To take reasonable care to protect the health and safety of themselves
    and of other people in the workplace </li>
  <li>Not to engage in improper behaviour that will endanger themselves or
    others </li>
  <li>Not to be under the influence of drink or drugs in the workplace </li>
  <li>To undergo any reasonable medical or other assessment if requested to do
    so by the employer </li>
  <li>To report any defects in the place of work or equipment which might be a
    danger to health and safety </li>
</ul><h3>Risk assessment and safety statement</h3>

<p>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 every employer is
required to carry out a risk assessment for the workplace which should identify
any hazards present in the workplace, assess the risks arising from such
hazards and identify the steps to be taken to deal with any risks. </p>

<p>The employer must also prepare a safety statement which is based on the risk
assessment. The statement should also contain the details of people in the
workforce who are responsible for safety issues. Employees should be given
access to this statement and employers should review it on a regular basis. The
Health and Safety Authority has published <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Small_Business/Getting_Started/Risk_Assessments_Made_Easy/Guidelines_on_Risk_Assessments_and_Safety_Statements.pdf">guidelines
on risk assessments and safety statements (pdf).</a></p>

<h3>Protective equipment and measures</h3>

<p>The employer should tell employees about any risks that require the wearing
of protective equipment. The employer should provide protective equipment (such
as protective clothing, headgear, footwear, eyewear, gloves) together with
training on how to use it, where necessary. An employee is under a duty to take
reasonable care for his/her own safety and to use any protective equipment
supplied. The protective equipment should be provided free of charge to
employees if it is intended for use at the workplace only. Usually, employees
should be provided with their own personal equipment. You can find more
information in this list of <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Topics/Personal_Protective_Equipment_-_PPE/PPE_-FAQs/Personal_Protective_Equipment_FAQ_Responses.html#PPE">frequently
asked questions about personal protective equipment</a>.</p>

<p>There is a range of measures that employers must take in regard to visual
display units (VDUs). These include examining the reflection and glare, the
operator's position in front of the VDU, the keyboard and the software used.
Operators must be given adequate breaks from the VDU. In addition, employers
must arrange for eye tests and, if required, make a contribution towards the
purchase of prescription eyeglasses. The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) has
published a <a href="http://hsa.ie/eng/Workplace_Health/Manual_Handling_Display_Screen_Equipment/FAQs/">list
of frequently asked questions about display screen equipment (VDUs).</a><br></p>

<h3>Reporting accidents<br></h3>

<p>All accidents in the workplace should be reported to the employer, who
should record the details of the incident. Reporting the accident will help to
safeguard social welfare and other rights which may arise as a result of an
occupational accident. An employer is obliged to report any accident that
results in an employee missing 3 consecutive days at work (not including the
day of the accident) to the Health and Safety Authority. <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/si/370/made/en/print">The Safety,
Health and Welfare at work (General Application) (Amendment) (No.3) Regulations
2016 (SI 370/2016)</a> set out the statutory responsibilities on employers in
reporting of accidents and dangerous occurrences at workplaces. </p>

<h3>Health and safety leave </h3>

<p>An employer should carry out separate risk assessments in relation to
pregnant employees. If there are particular risks to an employee's pregnancy,
these should be either removed or the employee moved away from them. Under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0034/sec0018.html#zza34y1994s18">Section
18 of the Maternity Protection Act 1994</a> if neither of these options is
possible, the employee should be given health and safety leave from work, which
may continue up the beginning of maternity leave. If a doctor certifies that
night work would be unsuitable for a pregnant employee, the employee must be
given alternative work or health and safety leave. </p>

<p>Following an employee's return to work after maternity leave, if there is
any risk to the employee because she has recently given birth or is
breastfeeding, it should be removed. If this is not possible, the employee
should be moved to alternative work. If it is not possible for the employee to
be assigned alternative work, she should be given health and safety leave. If
night work is certified by a doctor as being unsuitable after the birth,
alternative work should be provided. If alternative work cannot be provided,
the employee should be given health and safety leave.</p>

<p>Time spent on health and safety leave is treated as though the employee has
been in employment, and this time can be used to accumulate annual leave
entitlement. The employee is not entitled to leave for any public holidays that
occur during health and safety leave. During health and safety leave, employers
must pay employees their normal wages for the first 21 days (3 weeks), after
which <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/health_safety_benefit.html">Health
and Safety Benefit</a> may be paid.</p>

<h3>Health and safety and young people</h3>

<p>An employer should carry out a separate risk assessment in relation to an
employee under 18 years of age. This risk assessment should be carried out
before the young person is employed. If certain risks are present, including
risks that cannot be recognised or avoided by the young person due to factors
like lack of experience, the young person should not be employed. </p>

<h3>Bullying<br></h3>

<p>One of the employer’s duties is to prevent improper conduct or behaviour
(which includes bullying). An employer should have established procedures for
dealing with complaints of <a shape="rect" href="../../equality_in_work/bullying_in_the_workplace.html">bullying in the
workplace</a> and deal with such complaints immediately. Ignoring complaints of
bullying could leave an employer open to a possible claim for damages by an
employee. It is advisable for an employer to have an established grievance
procedure to deal with complaints of bullying. An employee who feels that he or
she is the victim of bullying can also refer the matter to the <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace
Relations Commission</a> – see ‘How to apply' below. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Publications_and_Forms/Publications/Occupational_Health/CoP_Bullying.pdf">Code
of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention and Resolution of
Bullying at Work (pdf)</a> sets out guidance notes for addressing bullying in
the workplace.</p>

<h3>Harassment</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ihrec.ie/publications/list/ihrec-employment-equality-rights-explained/">Employment
Equality Acts 1998-2015</a> place an obligation on all employers to prevent <a shape="rect" href="../../equality_in_work/harassment_at_work.html">harassment
in the workplace</a>. Under this law, you are entitled to bring a claim to the
Workplace Relations Commission and your employer may be obliged to pay you
compensation if you are harassed by reason of your gender, civil status, family
status, sexual orientation, age, disability, race, religious belief or
membership of the Traveller community. </p>

<h3>Violence in the workplace</h3>

<p>The possibility of violence towards employees should be addressed in the
safety statement. For example, factors like the isolation of employees and the
presence of cash on the premises need to be taken into account. Proper
safeguards should be put into place to eliminate the risk of violence as far as
possible and the employee should be provided with appropriate means of
minimising the remaining risk, for example, security glass. The Health and
Safety Authority has published a booklet for employers on <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Publications_and_Forms/Publications/Occupational_Health/Violence_at_Work.pdf">violence
in the workplace (pdf).</a></p>

<p><strong>Assault:</strong> Under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person
Act 1997 assault is a criminal offence. It is also an offence if you are made
to fear immediate assault. If you have been assaulted or threatened with
assault at work by another employee, you should report the matter immediately
to your employer and it can also be <a href="../../../justice/law_enforcement/reporting_a_crime.html">reported to
the Gardaí</a>. If your employer assaults you, you should report the matter to
the Gardaí. You should contact your doctor or seek medical treatment for your
injuries. You can also call one of the <a href="../../../justice/victims_of_crime/victim_support.html">organisations
providing support to victims of crime</a>. You can apply for compensation by
making a personal injuries claim – see ‘How to apply’ below.</p>

<h3>Victimisation<br></h3>

<p>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 the employee may not
be <a shape="rect" href="../../enforcement_and_redress/victimisation_at_work.html">victimised</a>
for exercising his or her rights under safety and health legislation such as
making a complaint. This means that the employer may not penalise an employee
by dismissal or in some other way, for example, by disciplinary action or by
being treated less favourably than other employees – see ‘Enforcing your
rights’ below.</p>

<h3>Health and Safety Authority</h3>

<p>The Health and Safety Authority – see ‘Where to apply’ below is
responsible for enforcing health and safety at work. It provides information to
employers, employees and self-employed people on workplace health and safety.
Its publications include a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Publications_and_Forms/Publications/Safety_and_Health_Management/Short_Guide_to_SHWWA_2005.pdf">Short
Guide to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 (pdf)</a> and a set of
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Topics/Simple_Safety/">Simple
Safety</a> leaflets which are aimed at small retail or food businesses in
particular. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Topics/Simple_Safety/Simple_Safety_in_Other_Languages/">The
Simple Safety leaflets are available in other languages.</a> </p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you have an accident at work you can apply for <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/injury_benefit.html">Injury
Benefit.</a> This is a weekly payment from the Department of Social Protection
if you are unfit for work due to an accident at work or an occupational
disease. Under the <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/medical_care_scheme.html">Medical
Care Scheme</a> you can claim certain medical costs that are not paid by the
Health Service Executive (HSE) or covered by Treatment Benefit Scheme. You can
find out more about these payments in <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/occupational_injuries_benefit_overview.html">our
document on the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme.</a></p>

<p><strong>Personal injury claim:</strong> If you have suffered an injury at
work, you cannot seek compensation from your employer under the health and
safety legislation but you can make a personal injury claim through <a shape="rect" href="../../../../justice/civil_law/personal_injuries_assessment_board.html">InjuriesBoard.ie</a>.
It is an independent statutory body which gives an independent assessment of
personal injury claims for compensation following an accident. It will only
give an assessment of compensation where the person responsible is not seeking
a decision on liability, or, in other words, where legal issues are not
disputed. All claims involving workplace accidents (employer liability cases)
must be submitted to InjuriesBoard.ie before starting legal proceedings. All
personal injury claims (excluding medical negligence) must also be submitted to
InjuriesBoard.ie. It assesses compensation quickly but doesn't award costs for
or against either party. If either you or your employer rejects the assessment
the Board will issue you with an authorisation allowing you to make a <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/civil_law/taking_a_civil_case_intro.html">claim
through the civil courts.</a></p>

<p>If you wish to make a complaint of victimisation or about your rights under
the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act you should apply to the Workplace
Relations Commission within 6 months of the complaint occurring. You must use
the online complaint form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.
The time limit may be extended for up to a further 6 months, but only where
there is a reasonable cause which prevented the complaint being brought within
the normal time limit.</p>

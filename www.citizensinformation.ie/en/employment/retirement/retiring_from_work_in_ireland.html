<p>For many of us, the prospect of retirement from work provides an opportunity
to seek fresh directions and new challenges. You may, for example, be thinking
of taking up a different area of paid or voluntary work, learning some new
skills, embarking on some travel or just spending more time on a favourite
hobby or pastime.</p>

<p>Planning for your retirement will give you the best chance of maximising
your time, adjusting to this lifestyle change and help you budget for the type
of financial security you would like during retirement. People today are living
longer, healthier lives so it's important to plan in advance for this new phase
in life. </p>

<h3>Lifestyle changes</h3>

<p>For most of us, the move from work to retirement takes place on a specified
date and is not negotiable. In other words, you retire from work when you reach
a particular age or another date that is set out in your contract of
employment. Other people may be in a position to gradually ease into retirement
by reducing their workload or doing part-time work. The following information
outlines the various issues that may arise as you make the change from work to
retirement and provides information that may help you to make a smooth
transition. A number of organisations throughout the country provide
pre-retirement courses which may help you to prepare for retirement. Active
retirement is a concept while has become increasingly popular in Ireland and
there are a range of <a shape="rect" href="retirement_from_work/active_retirement.html">active retirement
organisations</a> which promote education and leisure activities for retired
people. </p>

<h3>Working in retirement</h3>

<p>Some retired people may simply have retired from one occupation. For that
reason, you may regard retirement as a job change rather than a total
withdrawal from the labour market. Retiring from work therefore may simply
signal a career change. Most legislation dealing with the protection of
employees in Ireland does not have an upper age limit. This means that if you
are <a shape="rect" href="older_people_and_working/working_in_retirement.html">working in
retirement</a>, then you have the same employment rights as everyone else. If
you decide to work part-time, you can find out about <a href="../types_of_employment/part_time_employment/employment_rights_of_part_time_workers.html">employment
rights of part-time workers.</a> </p>

<h3>Retirement age</h3>

<p>There is no single retirement age in Ireland, although 65 is generally
regarded as the age most people retire at. There are upper age limits that
restrict entry for various activities, such as entry to some professions. </p>

<p>Most contracts of employment have a mandatory retirement age - the age at
which you must retire. The usual retirement age in contracts of employment is
65. Many employment contracts, however, make provision for early retirement
from age 60, (or in some cases, from age 55). Most also make provision for
early retirement on health grounds. </p>

<p>The Employment Equality Acts provide for <a shape="rect" href="older_people_and_working/age_equality_in_employment.html">age equality in
employment</a> but they do not prevent the setting of different ages for
retirement. If you opt for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/older_and_retired_people/early_retirement.html">early
retirement</a>, you may need to take various steps to ensure that you maintain
your entitlement to <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/older_and_retired_people/">social
welfare pensions</a>. </p>

<h3>Income supports while retired</h3>

<p>Before you decide to retire from work, you may need to know what income
supports are available. If you are taking early retirement, you may consider
yourself unemployed rather than retired and you may need information on
benefits for unemployed people. If you are made redundant you may be entitled
to a <a shape="rect" href="../unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/redundancy.html">statutory
redundancy lump sum</a>. If you retire early, for whatever reason, you may be
entitled to <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker’s
Benefit</a> and subsequently, to <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s
Allowance</a>. You may also be eligible for a range of <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_and_work/">back
to work</a> and <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">back
to education</a> schemes. </p>

<h3>Pensions</h3>

<p>There are various types of pension available. You may have contributed to a
pension scheme during your working life, in which case you will get an <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/occupational_pensions.html">occupational
pension</a> or have a <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/personal_pensions.html">personal
pension</a> arrangement. You need to deal directly with the pension provider to
find out exactly what benefits your pension gives you. </p>

<p>If you made sufficient PRSI contributions during your working life, at age
66 you may be entitled to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html">State
Pension (Contributory).</a> If you have not made sufficient PRSI contributions,
you can apply for a <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/older_and_retired_people/state_pension_non_contributory.html">State
Pension (Non-Contributory),</a> which is means-tested. You may also be entitled

Travel</a> and to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/extra_social_welfare_benefits/household_benefits_package.html">Household
Benefits Package</a> </p>

compensation payments</a> are taxed. There are some <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/older_peoples_tax_credits_and_reliefs.html">special

this option, you can find out about <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/">moving to Ireland. </a></p>

<h3>Legal issues and older people</h3>

<p>It's easy to postpone thinking about what will happen when you get older or
if you become unable to manage your own financial and legal affairs. However,
it is important for anyone at any age to consider these issues. There are <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/legal_matters_and_health/legal_arrangements_for_incapacity.html">legal
arrangements in the event of incapacity</a> and you can find out about <a shape="rect" href="/en/death/before_a_death/making_a_will.html">making a will</a>

<p>There is no single fixed retirement age for employees. If you are employed,
your retirement age is set out in your <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/contracts_of_employment/contract_of_employment.html">contract
of employment</a>. Some contracts of employment have a mandatory retirement age
(that is, the age at which you must retire), but they also have provisions for
earlier retirement generally and/or on grounds of illness. The usual retirement
age in contracts of employment is 65. Many have provisions for early retirement
from age 60 or in some cases from age 55 and most have provision for early
retirement on health grounds.</p>

<p>In some cases, there is a statutory retirement age. These retirement ages
arise in jobs that are established by law and the law sets out the maximum age
of staff. </p>

<p>If you are self-employed, there is <span>no set retirement age</span>. There
is no overall retirement age for company directors, but the company's articles
of association may set a maximum age.</p>

<h3>Mandatory retirement</h3>

<p>The mandatory retirement age is the age at which you must retire. It is
usually set out in your contract of employment. There are still some
employments where the contract of employment does not include a mandatory
retirement age but they are unusual.</p>

<p>The retirement age in the public sector for people who joined it before 1
April 2004 is 65 years. Some occupations - for example, the Gardai,
firefighters and the Defence Forces - have provisions for much earlier
retirement. </p>

<p>The minimum retirement age is 65 for people who joined the public service
after 1 April 2004. For people who joined the public service after 1 January
2013 the minimum retirement age is 66 and the mandatory retirement age is 70.
This means that they will not have retire at age 65 or 66 but can continue
working, subject to suitability and health requirements. Pension benefits for
new entrants to the public service will therefore accrue on a standard basis
(that is, one year's credit for one year's service up to a maximum of 40 years'
service). The minimum retirement age is 55 for people who joined the Gardai and
Fire Service after 1 April 2004, while the compulsory retirement age for Gardai
is 60.</p>

<p><strong>Equality legislation:</strong> Discrimination on the grounds of age
for everyone aged over 16 is prohibited under employment equality legislation.
However, employers are still allowed to set minimum recruitment ages of 18 or
under and to set retirement ages in employment contracts. Since 1 January 2016,
<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0021/sec0034.html#sec34">section
34</a> of the Employment Equality Act 1998 is amended by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/43/enacted/en/html">Equality
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015</a> to the effect that an employer may set
a mandatory retirement age provided it is objectively justified.</p>

<h3>Statutory retirement age</h3>

<p>There is a statutory, (that is, set out in legislation), retirement age for
some public servants. For people who joined the public service before 1 April
2004 this is generally 65. Since 1 January 2013, the minimum retirement age for
new entrants is 66 rising to 68 in 2028 in line with the <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html">State
Contributory Pension</a>. </p>

<h3>Self-employed people</h3>

<p>In general, self-employed people do not face age limits. </p>

<p>General practitioners must retire from the General Medical Services scheme
at age 70 â€“ this is a statutory provision. However, they may continue in
private practice if they meet the fitness to practice criteria set by the
Medical Council.</p>

<p>There is no general age limit for company directors, but sometimes the
company's articles of association may specify an upper age limit.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0021/index.html">Employment
Equality Acts 1998-2015</a> prohibit discrimination in employment on a number
of grounds, including age. It is unlawful to discriminate against anyone in
employment on grounds of age. The Acts only apply to persons above the maximum
age at which a person is statutorily obliged to attend school (16 currently).
However there are a number of exceptions to the general principle of
non-discrimination. The Acts also provide for positive action on a number of
grounds including age. </p>

<h3>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission</h3>

<p>The <a href="../../../justice/law_and_rights/irish_human_rights_commission.html">Irish
Human Rights and Equality Commission</a> has a general remit to promote
equality under the employment equality legislation. In some instances it
provides assistance to people who believe they have been discriminated
against.</p>

<h3>The Workplace Relations Commission</h3>

<p>The Workplace Relations Commission investigates and/or mediates <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/equality_tribunal.html">disputes in
relation to the implementation of employment equality legislation.</a>
Complaints about age discrimination are investigated by the Equality Tribunal
which may order redress or compensation. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015 outlaw direct, indirect
discrimination and discrimination by association at work and in all aspects of
employment on the grounds of gender, civil and family status, sexual
orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller
community.</p>

<h3>Age discrimination</h3>

<p>Discrimination is defined as the treatment of one person in a less
favourable way than another person in a comparable situation on
<span>any</span> of the grounds specified. It will cover not only current and
past discrimination, but also discrimination that may exist in the future or is
imputed to a person. </p>

<h3>Where discrimination arises</h3>

<p>The Acts outlaw discrimination by: </p>
<ul><li>Employers</li>
  <li>Employment agencies </li>
  <li>Providers of vocational training </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/industrial_relations_and_trade_unions/trade_unions.html">Trade
    unions</a> </li>
  <li>Employer organisations</li>
  <li>Professional bodies </li>
  <li>Trade associations </li>
</ul><p>The Acts also outlaw discrimination in job advertisements. </p>

<p>Prohibited discrimination relates to equal pay, access to employment,
conditions of employment, training or experience, promotion or regrading or
classification of posts. Conditions of employment do not, in this context,
include pensions. </p>

<p>Indirect discrimination occurs where an apparently neutral provision puts
persons of a particular group covered by the Acts at a particular disadvantage
and where the provision is not objectively justified by a legitimate aim and
the means of achieving the aim are not appropriate and necessary.</p>

<h3>Exclusions from the general prohibition of discrimination on age
grounds</h3>

<p>Under the Employment Equality Acts 1998–2015 an employer may: </p>
<ul><li>Set a minimum age requirement (not more than 18 years) for potential
    applicants for a job </li>
  <li>Offer a fixed-term contract to a person over the compulsory retirement
    age provided it is objectively justified </li>
</ul><p>With regard to an occupational benefits scheme, it does not constitute
discrimination on age grounds for an employer to: </p>
<ul><li>Fix ages for admission to such a scheme or for entitlement to benefits
    under it</li>
  <li>Fix different ages for all employees or a category of employees</li>
  <li>Use, in the context of such a scheme, age criteria in actuarial
    calculations </li>
  <li>Provide different rates of severance payment for different employees or
    groups or categories of employees, these rates being based on or taking
    into account the period between the age of an employee on leaving the
    employment and his or her compulsory retirement age</li>
</ul><p>provided that these measures do not constitute discrimination on the gender
grounds.</p>

<h3>Positive action</h3>

<p>Positive action to ease the integration into employment of people across all
9 grounds is allowed under the Acts. </p>

<p>If you feel that you have been discriminated against on the grounds of age
(or any of the other grounds), you should first of all raise the issue with the
employer or service provider. If this proves to be unsatisfactory, you should
make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission using the online
complaint form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.</p>

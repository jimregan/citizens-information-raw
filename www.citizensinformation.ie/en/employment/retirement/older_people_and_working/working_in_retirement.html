<p>Some people take early retirement in order to take up another job or to
become self-employed. Many people aged over the "normal"<em></em>retirement age
are employed. There are a small number of occupations that have statutory upper
age limits but, in general, there is no rule which prevents people over the age
of 65 from being employed or self-employed. Many self-employed people continue
to be so well past the "normal" retirement age.</p>

<p>If you were a permanent and pensionable public servant, your pension may be
abated if you go back to work in the public sector. It is generally not
possible to further contribute to an occupational pension scheme after the
normal age of retirement. </p>

<h3>Retirement age</h3>

<p>In general, there is no upper age limit for employment and there is no
single fixed <a href="retirement_age_in_ireland.html">retirement age</a> for
employees. If you are employed, your retirement age is set out in your <a href="../../employment_rights_and_conditions/contracts_of_employment/contract_of_employment.html">contract
of employment</a>. Some contracts of employment have a mandatory retirement age
(that is, the age at which you must retire), but they also have provisions for
earlier retirement generally and/or on grounds of illness. The usual retirement
age in contracts of employment is 65. Many have provisions for early retirement
from age 60 or from age 55 and most have provision for early retirement on
health grounds.</p>

<p>In some cases, there is a statutory retirement age. These retirement ages
arise in jobs that are established by law and the law sets out the maximum age
of staff. If your contract of employment includes a mandatory upper age limit,
then you must retire when you reach that limit. However, it is open to you and
your employer to negotiate another contract. </p>

<p>If you are subject to a statutory or mandatory retirement age in your job,
there is nothing to prevent you taking up a different job when you retire or
taking up self-employment. </p>

<h3>Effect on social welfare payments</h3>

<p>If you are receiving any social welfare payment other than the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html">State
Pension (Contributory)</a> or <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/death_related_benefits/widows_contrib_pension.html">Widow's,
Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension</a>, working will
affect your entitlement.</p>

<h3>Jobseeker's Benefit or Allowance</h3>

<p>It may be possible to do some part-time work and retain entitlement to part
of your <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker's
Benefit</a> or <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
Allowance</a>.</p>

<h3>Pre-Retirement Allowance</h3>

<p>If you are getting Pre-Retirement Allowance it may be possible to do some
work and retain some entitlement. </p>

<h3>State Pension (Contributory) </h3>

<p>If you are receiving the State Pension (Contributory), you may work or be
self-employed without affecting your entitlement. However, any increase for a
qualified adult may be affected if your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant
works.</p>

<h3>Occupational pensions</h3>

<p>If you are receiving an <a href="../../../money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/occupational_pensions.html">occupational
pension</a>, then you may also work or be self-employed and if you are
receiving a private sector pension, working or being self-employed does not
usually affect it.</p>

<p>However, most public sector pension schemes are subject to what is called
<em>abatemen</em>t if you return to work in the public sector. The precise
conditions may vary from one scheme to another but, in general, abatement means
that the pension is reduced in order to ensure that you do not earn more
between the pension and the income from employment than you would if you had
remained in employment. If you are getting a public service pension and you go
to work in the private sector, your pension is not affected.</p>

<h3>Contributions to occupational pensions</h3>

<p>If you are employed, you may contribute to the new employment pension scheme
if you are eligible. Most occupational pension schemes do not cater for
contributions over the age of 65 but it is possible that some do. It is
possible to get tax relief on contributions up to age 70. </p>

<p>If you are self-employed or your new employment does not include an
occupational pension, you could decide to make arrangements for a personal
pension. Again, the upper age limit for tax relief for such contributions is
70. </p>

<h3>Protective employee legislation</h3>

<p>Most legislation dealing with the protection of employees does not have an
upper age limit. So, if you are an older worker, whether full or part-time, you
are covered by protective legislation dealing with the following areas:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/contracts_of_employment/contract_of_employment.html">Information
    about your terms and conditions of employment</a> </li>
  <li><a href="../../employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/">Holidays
    and leave </a></li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/pay_inc_min_wage.html">National
    minimum wage</a> </li>
  <li><a href="../../employment_rights_and_conditions/hours_of_work/working_week.html">Maximum
    working hours,</a> rest periods, Sunday working, night working </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/health_and_safety/health_safety_work.html">Health
    and safety at work</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/losing_your_job/losing_job_entitlements.html">Minimum
    notice</a> - the amount of notice is related to the length of service </li>
</ul><p>If you <a href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/losing_your_job/losing_your_job.html">lose
your job</a> and your employer owes you money for arrears of pay, holidays and
a number of other items, you may claim this from the Social Insurance Fund. </p>

<h3>Unfair dismissal</h3>

<p>Under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, dismissal on the grounds of age is unfair
with certain exceptions. People who must leave employment when they reach the
retirement age stated in their contract may not claim unfair dismissal.</p>

<p>If you are <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfairly
dismissed</a>, at whatever age, you may complain to the <a href="../../enforcement_and_redress/labour_relations_commission.html">Workplace
Relations Commission</a> using the online complaint form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>.
</p>

<h3>Redundancy</h3>

<p>If you are made redundant you may be entitled to a <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/redundancy.html">redundancy
payment.</a> </p>

<h3>Equality</h3>

<p>The Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015 prohibit discrimination on 9 grounds
including that of age (with certain exceptions). They apply to all ages above
the age a person is statutorily obliged to go to school (16 currently). You can
read more in our document, <a href="age_equality_in_employment.html">Age
equality in employment</a>.</p>

<h3>Social insurance (PRSI) contributions</h3>

<p>If you are aged under 66 and you are employed or self-employed, you are
liable to pay PRSI in the normal way. This applies regardless of what you did
earlier. For example, if you are a former public servant and you take up a job
in the private sector, you have to pay full PRSI. In these circumstances, you
may be able to qualify for a pro-rata old age contributory pension. </p>

<p>You only pay PRSI on your income from employment or self-employment. You do
not have to pay PRSI on your pension from a former employment.</p>

<p>If you take up part-time work or low paid work, you are still in the PRSI
system but you may not have to pay anything. If you earn less than €352 a
week, you don't have to pay PRSI. If you earn over €38, your employer has to
pay and you have full cover. Once you step over the €352 limit, you have to
pay on all your income from work. A <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/employer_s_duty_to_pay_social_insurance_prsi.html">new
PRSI credit was introduced in 2016</a> which reduces the amount of PRSI payable
for people earning between €352.01 and €424 per week. The credit is tapered
and the amount of the credit depends on your earnings.</p>

<p>You are not liable for PRSI contributions after the age of 66 - this is the
case whether or not you are employed or self-employed. If you do not have
enough contributions at age 66, you cannot add to them after that. Unlike some
occupational pension arrangements, there is no facility to retrospectively pay
PRSI contributions. </p>

<p>If you are aged 66 and in employment, your employer pays a small PRSI
contribution to cover you for occupational injuries. This is called Class J
social insurance.</p>

<h3>Universal Social Charge </h3>

<p>You pay the <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">Universal
Social Charge (USC)</a> if your gross income is more than €13,000 per year.
It does not apply to social welfare or similar payments. Reduced rates of USC
apply to people aged 70 or over whose aggregate income for the year is
€60,000 or less and to certain medical card holders under 70.</p>

<h3>Tax</h3>

<p>Income tax applies to almost all income. People aged 65 and over are subject
to the same general tax rules as everyone else but they do get tax exemption
limits below which they pay no tax and some extra tax credits. There are <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/older_peoples_tax_credits_and_reliefs.html">specific
tax arrangements for people aged over 65</a> including the <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/taxation_of_pensions.html">taxation
of occupational pensions</a> and the <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">taxation
of social welfare payments.</a></p>

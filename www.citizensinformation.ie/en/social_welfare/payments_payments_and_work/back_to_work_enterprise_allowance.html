<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) scheme encourages people
getting certain social welfare payments <a href="../../../employment/types_of_employment/self_employment/self_employment_as_an_individual.html">to
become self-employed</a>. If you take part in the Back to Work Enterprise
Allowance scheme you can keep a percentage of your social welfare payment for
up to 2 years. </p>

<p>A Back to Work Scheme called the <a href="short_term_enterprise_allowance.html">Short-Term Enterprise
Allowance</a> started in May 2009. There is no qualifying period for the
Short-Term Enterprise Allowance. You can get immediate access to the allowance
if you meet the qualifying conditions.</p>

<p>The Back to Work Enterprise Allowance is payable to people aged under 66.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You can qualify for a Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) if you
are:</p>

    advance in writing by a DSP Case Officer or Local Development Company (LDC)
    (see 'How to apply' below)

  <li>Qualifying from Illness Benefit: 3 out of last 5 years in receipt of a
    qualifying social welfare payment</li>
</ul><p><strong>or</strong></p>
<ul><li>Combination of OFP/JST/JA for 9 months (234 days)</li>
</ul><p>*Having an underlying entitlement to Jobseeker's Allowance means that you
would pass the means test and other criteria. Signing on for <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">unemployment
credits</a> following your Jobseeker's Benefit does not count towards the
qualifying period. </p>

<p>You may also be considered for the BTWEA if you are:</p>
<ul><li>A <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">dependent
    adult</a> of a person who is in receipt of the BTWEA. You may qualify if
    the person taking part in the BTWEA scheme stops their self-employment
    before exhausting their entitlement. The spouse or partner may avail of the
    scheme for the time remaining on the original claim. This involves the
    person who is eligible for the BTWEA transferring his or her entitlements
    to their spouse, civil partner or cohabitant. (In other words, the spouse,
    civil partner or cohabitant becomes self-employed and the original claimant
    becomes the qualified adult on the BTWEA). If the original claimant is
    entitled to credits, he or she can continue to claim them. However BTWEA
    cannot be paid at the same time as another social welfare payment so if the
    original claimant (now a qualified adult) decides to claim another payment
    you must stop claiming BTWEA.</li>
  <li>A person released from prison who satisfies the eligibility criteria for
    the scheme. </li>
</ul><p><strong>Qualifying periods<a></a></strong></p>

<p>Periods of time spent on full-time FET, Fáilte Ireland and Teagasc training
courses, Community Employment, Social Economy Programme, Rural Social Scheme,
FIT, Job Initiative, JobBridge, Work Placement Programme, Tús, BTEA and VTOS
schemes are accepted as qualifying periods provided you were entitled to a
qualifying payment before starting on the study or training. The Department of
Social Protection also counts time spent on the Community Services Programme
provided you were getting a qualifying social welfare payment for at least half
of the qualifying period. </p>

<p>Time spent on Supplementary Welfare Allowance or in direct provision can
count towards the qualifying period for BTWEA as long as you establish an
entitlement to a relevant payment before starting the BTWEA. </p>

<p>If you have previously participated in the BTWEA scheme and used up your
entitlement, you can participate a second time after at least 5 years. </p>

periods for Back to Work Enterprise Allowance</a>. </p>

<h3>Help starting a business</h3>

<p>In addition to income support (your weekly payment), you can also get
financial support with the costs of setting up your business. These supports
are provided under a scheme called the Enterprise Support Grant (ESG). (The ESG
replaced the Technical Assistance and Training Scheme (TATS) from 16 April
2014.)</p>

<p>You can only get the ESG if you have been approved for the Back to Work
Enterprise Allowance. The business plan you submit as part of your application
for the scheme must set out the rationale and requirement for financial
support. The ESG can pay a total of €2,500 in any 24-month period (The ESG is
paid to people getting the Short-Term Enterprise Allowance on a pro-rata
basis). You must be able to make a matching contribution of at least 20% to
access grant support. You need to provide documentary evidence of the costs
(quotations from at least 2 suppliers or, if a single supplier, the reasons for
choosing a single supplier). </p>

<p>Eligible items for grant support include:</p>

<h3>Employment grants</h3>

<p>Employment grants from a Local Enterprise Office (LEO) or Local Development
Companies do not affect your entitlement to the Back to Work Enterprise
Allowance.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p><strong>If you qualify for the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance</strong>
you can keep the following portion of your social welfare payment, including
increases for a qualified adult and qualified children, for a maximum of 2
years:</p>
<ul><li>100% for the 1st year </li>
  <li>75% for the 2nd year</li>
</ul><p>If your qualified adult finds employment this does not affect your BTWEA.
However if your qualified adult claims another social welfare payment in their
own right or takes up Community Employment your BTWEA payment will be reduced
accordingly. </p>

<h3>Extra benefits</h3>

<p>You can keep your extra (or secondary benefits) for as long as you are
getting the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance.</p>

<p>However you must be deemed eligible for the <a href="../../../housing/local_authority_and_social_housing/rental_accommodation_scheme.html">Rental
Accomodation Scheme</a> to keep your Rent Supplement. Your Rent Supplement may
be affected if your earnings go up while you are on the scheme. You should
check with the <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/how_health_is_organised/health_boards_and_community_welfare_officers.html">Department
of Social Protection's representative (formerly known as the Community Welfare
Officer)</a> in your <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/otheroffice/community-welfare-office-contact.aspx">local
health centre</a> to see how your <a shape="rect" href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a> may be affected by your participation in the Back to Work
Enterprise Allowance. </p>

<p>Extra benefits include:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="../extra_social_welfare_benefits/fuel_allowance.html">Fuel
    Allowance</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">Medical
    card</a></li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/back_to_school_clothing_and_footwear_allowance.html">Back
    to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance</a> </li>
  <li>Differential rents (from your <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/local_and_regional_government/local_authorities.html">local
    authority</a>) </li>
</ul><p>The Back to Work Enterprise Allowance is paid directly into your bank or
building society account each week. The allowance <span>cannot be paid</span>
into a mortgage account. </p>

<p>You must contact the Department of Social Protection immediately if your
self-employment ends or you take up employment. <a></a><strong>You do not have
to pay tax, PRSI or Universal Social Charge</strong> on the Back to Work
Enterprise Allowance but you may have to pay tax, PRSI and Universal Social
Charge on any income you get from self-employment. </p>

<p>You can claim <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/start_your_own_business_scheme.html">Start
Your Own Business Relief</a> if you are getting the Back to Work Enterprise
Allowance (BTWEA). This scheme provides a two-year exemption from income tax
(up to a maximum of €40,000 per year) for people who have been unemployed for
at least 12 months before starting their own business. It runs from 23 October
2013 to 31 December 2018. (However if you started to get the BTWEA before 25
October 2013 you do not qualify for the relief because you had already started
your business before the start date for the scheme.)</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>To apply for the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance, complete application <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/btw2.pdf">form BTW 2</a>. </p>

<p>If you live in an area covered by a Local Development Company (LDC)
(sometimes known as local partnership companies) you should return form BTW 2
to the Enterprise Officer in the LDC. If you do <strong>not</strong> live in a
LDC Area, you should return form BTW 2 to the Case Officer in your Intreo
Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office.</p>

<p>The Enterprise Officer or Case Officer will look at your business proposal
and may discuss certain aspects of it with you. You must <strong>not</strong>
take up self-employment until you have received written approval from the LDC
or Department of Social Protection. </p>

<p>If you are accepted on to the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance, you must <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/running/registering-tax.html">register
as self-employed with the Revenue Commissioners</a>. </p>

<h4>Appealing a decision</h4>

<p>The BTWEA is an administrative scheme. This means that you cannot appeal a
decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. However you can ask the
Department of Social Protection to review your application if you feel that you
have been wrongly refused the allowance.<br></p>

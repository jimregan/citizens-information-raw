<p>The social welfare system in Ireland is divided into three main types of
payments. These are: </p>
<ul><li>Social insurance payments </li>
  <li>Means-tested payments </li>
  <li>Universal payments </li>
</ul><p>With all social welfare payments, you must satisfy specific personal
circumstances that are set out in the rules for each scheme. For example, to
claim the <a shape="rect" href="../payments_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent
Family Payment</a>, you must be parenting alone and therefore not cohabiting.
As well as satisfying the necessary circumstantial criteria, other rules also
apply. We briefly explain these under the headings for the different types of
payments.</p>

<p>There is also a range of <a href="../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/schemes_to_support_employment.html">employment
schemes and other supports</a> which encourage long-term unemployed people to
return to work. </p>

<p>Since May 2004, you must be habitually resident to qualify for social
assistance payments in Ireland. <a shape="rect" href="social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">Find
out more about the residency requirements for social assistance payments in
Ireland.</a> </p>

<h3>Social insurance payments</h3>

<p>Social insurance payments are given to people who satisfy specific <a shape="rect" href="social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social insurance
contribution conditions (PRSI conditions)</a>, in addition to the necessary
circumstantial conditions. These conditions vary, depending on the payment you
apply for. A summary of the PRSI contribution conditions for each payment is
set out in individual leaflets on different payments, which are available on
the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie">Department of Social
Protection's website</a>. Payments based on your social insurance contributions
include <a shape="rect" href="../payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker's
Benefit</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../payments/disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">Illness
Benefit</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../payments_payments_to_families_and_children/maternity_benefit.html">Maternity
Benefit</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../payments/disability_and_illness/invalidity_pension.html">Invalidity
Pension</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../payments/carers/carers_benefit.html">Carer's Benefit</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../payments/older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html">State
Pension (Contributory).</a> </p>

<h3>Means-tested payments</h3>

<p>Means-tested payments are designed for people who do not have enough PRSI
contributions to qualify for the equivalent social insurance-based payments. An
example would be a person who becomes unemployed, applies for Jobseeker's
Benefit but fails to qualify because he or she does not have enough social
insurance contributions. He or she can apply for <a shape="rect" href="../payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
Allowance</a> instead, which is the means-tested equivalent payment. </p>

<p><em>A means test</em> is where the Department of Social Protection examines
all your sources of income to see whether they fall below a certain level. How
your means are tested varies from payment to payment. In some instances, you
are allowed a certain amount of income or savings before your entitlement to a
payment is affected. The rules that determine how much you can or cannot have
depend on the payment you apply for and are often referred to as <em>income
disregards</em>. </p>

<h3>Universal payments</h3>

<p>Universal payments are paid regardless of a person's income or social
insurance record. They are dependent on the claimant satisfying specific
personal circumstances. An example is <a shape="rect" href="../payments_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child
Benefit</a> (often known as the Children's Allowance). A person must simply
have a child dependant living with them as defined in the social welfare
legislation. (Migrant workers from EEA Member States may get Child Benefit if
their dependent child is resident in another EEA Member State.)<br></p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The rules governing social welfare payments are set out in legislation
and/or administrative guidelines. Most of the detailed Operational Guidelines
governing social welfare payments are available from the Department of Social
Protection. </p>

<p>For most social insurance and social assistance payments, decisions in
relation to entitlement are made by Deciding Officers. Deciding Officers are
social welfare officials appointed under the social welfare legislation. Other
payments such as those available under the <a shape="rect" href="../payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary
Welfare Allowance Scheme</a> and certain administrative schemes are made by
other officials within the Department of Social Protection.</p>

<p>Administrative schemes are payments that are not based in legislation but
are based on government decisions and administrative guidelines. Examples
include the awarding of credits and the <a shape="rect" href="../payments/extra_social_welfare_benefits/fuel_allowance.html">Fuel
Allowance</a>. </p>

<p>If you are not happy with a decision by the Department of Social Protection,
you have a right to appeal decisions in relation to payments that are based in
legislation. Appeals are made to the Social Welfare Appeals Office, an
independent statutory body. Find out how to <a shape="rect" href="social_welfare_appeals.html">appeal a decision of the Department of
Social Protection</a>. </p>

<p>If you are not happy with a decision in relation to an administrative
scheme, you can ask for an internal review. In this instance, you would put
your case to a more senior official within the Department requesting an
internal review to re-examine your application. You should try to submit as
much additional information as possible to help your case.</p>

<h3>Fraudulent claims</h3>

<p>Penalties for false or misleading statements made to obtain a social welfare
payment for you or for any other person, may result in large fines or prison
for up to three years. The Department of Social Protection has a <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Compliance-and-Anti-Fraud-Strategy-2014-2018-.aspx">Compliance
and Fraud Strategy </a>that aims to reduce social welfare fraud. </p>

<p>You can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/ContactUs/Pages/reportfraud.aspx">report
possible cases of fraud to the Department</a>. </p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<h3>Rates of payment and dependants</h3>

<p>Social welfare payments are divided into payments for the claimant, known as
the <em>personal rate</em> of payment and payments for any adult and child
dependants. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/sw19.aspx">SW 19 Rates of Payment
Booklet</a>, published by the Department of Social Protection every year,
details the amount of money payable for each scheme and the amount that will be
awarded to dependants of the claimant. </p>

<h3>Adult dependant</h3>

<p>An adult dependant of a claimant is called a <em>qualified adult</em>. A
payment for a qualified adult may be paid for a person who is wholly or mainly
maintained by the claimant and is either: </p>
<ul><li>A spouse, civil partner or cohabitant </li>
</ul><p><strong>Or</strong></p>
<ul><li>A person over 16 years of age who is caring for a child dependant of the
    claimant </li>
</ul><p><a shape="rect" href="claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">More
information is available in our document about claiming for an adult
dependant.</a></p>

<h3>Child dependant</h3>

<p>A child dependant is referred to as a <em>qualified child</em>. A qualified
child must be:</p>
<ul><li>Ordinarily resident in the State </li>
  <li>Not detained in a reformatory or industrial school </li>
  <li>Satisfy the age conditions</li>
</ul><p>Children under 18 are regarded as qualified children. Payments for child
dependants are made for children over 18 in some circumstances. </p>

<p>If you are applying for a <a shape="rect" href="../social_assistance_payments/social_assistance_in_ireland.html">social
assistance payment</a> you must satisfy a means test. All your sources of
income (for example, cash income, employment, capital and maintenance) are
assessed by the Department of Social Protection (DSP). </p>

<p>The purpose of this document is to explain how the DSP assesses your means
from capital for social welfare payments (with the exception of <a shape="rect" href="../../payments_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
Income Supplement</a> as capital is not assessed in this income test). More
information on other sources of income and income not taken into account is
available in our document on the <a shape="rect" href="means_test.html">means
test</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To find your means from capital, first you must calculate your total capital
value. You do this by adding together all your sources of capital (for example,
property, savings and investments). Then you apply the relevant formula
below.</p>

<p>The formula for assessing means from capital for all <strong>social welfare
payments</strong> (except Disability Allowance and Supplementary Welfare
Allowance) is as follows:</p>

<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" border="1" width="372" summary=""><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Capital </td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Weekly means assessed</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">First €20,000 </td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Nil</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Next €10,000 </td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€1 per €1,000 </td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Next €10,000 </td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€2 per €1,000</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Balance</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€4 per €1,000</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<p>The formula for assessing means from capital for <strong>Disability
Allowance</strong> is as follows: </p>

<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" border="1" width="372" summary=""><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Capital </td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Weekly means assessed</td>

      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€4 per €1,000</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<p>The formula for assessing means from capital for <strong>Supplementary
Welfare Allowance</strong> is as follows:</p>

<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" border="1" width="372" summary=""><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Capital </td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Weekly means assessed</td>

<h2>How property is treated</h2>

<h3>Your own home</h3>

<p>The home in which you live is not included in the assessment of your means
from capital <strong>unless</strong> you are getting an income from it. If you
are getting an income from your home (for example, if you have rented a room in
the house) that income is assessed. However, income from renting a room in your
home is not assessed if you are getting a State Pension (Non-Contributory) or a
Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Non-Contributory) Pension and
not renting the room means that you would be living alone.</p>

<h3><strong>Selling your home</strong></h3>

<p>If you sell your home, the proceeds of the sale are normally taken into
account as means. If you are living in accommodation which no longer suits you
or which you are no longer able to maintain, you may be able to sell your home
and move to more suitable accommodation and have up to €190,500 of the
proceeds of the sale exempt from the means test.</p>

<p>This exemption only applies if you are getting one of the following
payments:</p>
<ul><li>State Pension (Non-Contributory) </li>
  <li>Widow's, Widower's or Surviving civil Partner's (Non-Contributory)
    Pension (if you are 66 years of age or over) </li>
  <li>Disability Allowance</li>
  <li>Blind Pension</li>
</ul><p>The exemption only applies if you are getting one of the above social
welfare payments <strong>and</strong> sell your house in order to:</p>
<ul><li>Buy or rent more suitable alternative accommodation </li>
  <li>Move into a private nursing home which is registered under the Health
    (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 </li>
  <li>Move in with a person who getting a carer's payment to care for you</li>
  <li>Move to sheltered or special housing in the voluntary, co-operative,
    statutory or private sectors </li>
</ul><p>Usually the first €190,500 of the sale proceeds is not taken into account.
However, if you use the proceeds of the sale to buy more suitable
accommodation, the balance of the proceeds <strong>after</strong> buying the
new accommodation is exempt up to a limit of €190,500. </p>

<p><strong>Investment income from the sale of your home</strong></p>

<p>Any benefit you get from investing the sale proceeds is assessable as means.
Any interest paid and retained is assessable as capital.</p>

<p>However, the Department of Social Protection's <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Means-Assessment.aspx#appendix">Operational
Guidelines on Means Assessment</a> state that an allowance should be made where
a person has significant maintenance expenses, such as nursing home costs,
which are met out of interest payments. In such cases, the interest on the
exempted capital (up to a maximum of €190,500) may be disregarded as
means.</p>

<p><strong>Leaving your home but not selling <br></strong>If, due to old age or incapacity, you leave your home either on a
temporary basis or indefinitely, the value of your home will not be assessed as
means. However, if it is put to profitable use (for example, rented out), the
capital value of the house will then be assessed as means.</p>

<h3>Second homes and income from lettings</h3>

<p>The home in which you live is <em>not</em> included in the assessment of
your means from capital (see above). If you own a house which is let, you are
assessed on the capital value of the property. <strong>You will not be assessed
on the income from the letting.</strong> Any outstanding mortgage registered
against the property is deducted from the market value to find the capital
value.</p>

<p>However, if the mortgage on the home in which you live has been
re-structured to raise capital to buy the second property, this re-structured
mortgage will not be deducted from the capital assessment of the second
property.</p>

<p>For all second homes the property must be capable of being sold, let or put
to profitable use before a capital value assessment is applied.</p>

<p>More information about the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Means-Assessment.aspx#appendix">assessment
of capital as means</a> can be found on the Department of Social Protection
website. </p>

<h4>Situations where rental income <em>is</em> assessed</h4>

<p>Usually income from renting a property is not assessed. However there are
some situations where rental income is assessed. </p>
<ul><li>If you have a life interest in a property the rental income is assessed
    instead of the capital value.</li>
  <li>If you are claiming an increase for a qualified adult with your <a shape="rect" href="../social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social
    insurance payment</a> and if your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant owns
    property (in their own right or jointly with you) rental income from this
    property will be assessed for payment of an <a shape="rect" href="../claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">Increase
    for a Qualified Adult</a> . This rental income is assessed as cash in the
    means test and the capital value of the property is not assessed. However,
    the capital value will be assessed in the normal way if the property is not
    rented – see ‘Capital value’ above. </li>
  <li>If you apply for Family Income Supplement (FIS) rental income from the
    letting of property or land will be taken into account when assessing your
    income (the capital value is not assessed). </li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l0359f">Assessment of capital for couples</h2>

<p>If you have a joint account with your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant,
legally the total amount in the account is owned by each of you. Therefore it
could be assessed in full against each of you. However, if you and your spouse,
civil partner or cohabitant are both getting means-tested <a shape="rect" href="../social_assistance_payments/social_assistance_in_ireland.html">social
assistance payments</a>, it will be assessed either on a shared basis or
against only one of you. You can read more about <a href="assessing_the_means_of_a_couple.html">assessing the means of a couple
for social assistance payments</a>. </p>

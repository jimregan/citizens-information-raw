<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>One of the primary conditions for getting Jobseeker’s Allowance is that
you must be unemployed. However, you do not have to be totally unemployed –
you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 consecutive days. You must
also be available for and actively seeking work. </p>

<p>You can work and get Jobseeker’s Allowance if:</p>
<ul><li>Your days at work are reduced </li>
  <li>You are laid off work temporarily </li>
  <li>You are <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/unemployed_people/self_employed_and_unemployment.html">self-employed
    but your level of business and income has reduced</a> </li>
  <li>You can only get part-time or casual work. </li>
</ul><p>You must meet all the other <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">conditions
for Jobseeker’s Allowance</a>. For example, you must pass a means test and
you must also continue to look for full-time work.</p>

<p>Jobseeker’s Allowance is a means-tested payment so your household income
must be below a certain level to qualify. Your income from work is assessed and
can affect your Jobseeker's Allowance payment. However, only a certain amount
of income from work is taken into account. This is called your means from work.
If you have a <strong>spouse, civil partner or cohabitant </strong>their income
from work<strong></strong> or other sources is also taken into account and can
affect your Jobseeker’s Allowance payment.</p>

<p>Other sources of income can also affect your Jobseeker's Allowance payment.
<a shape="rect" href="../claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">Jobseeker’s
Allowance is not taxable</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l7ed0f">Calculating means from work</h2>

<p>Here we show you how to calculate your means from employment (not
self-employment). You can find out how income from self-employment is assessed
in our document <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/unemployed_people/self_employed_and_unemployment.html">Self-employment
and unemployment</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Assessable earnings from work</strong></p>

<p>The following items are always deducted from your gross earnings to get your
assessable earnings from work:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="../social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">PRSI
    (social insurance contributions)</a> </li>
  <li>Union dues </li>
  <li>Superannuation (pension)</li>
  <li>PRSAs (Personal Retirement Savings Accounts) </li>
  <li>AVCs (Additional Voluntary Contributions). </li>
</ul><p>You cannot deduct income tax or Universal Social Charge. </p>

<p>There are 2 stages to calculating how work will affect your Jobseeker’s
Allowance. </p>

<h3>Part 1: Find out if you have an entitlement to Jobseeker’s Allowance</h3>

<p>First, you must find out if you have an entitlement to Jobseeker’s
Allowance.</p>

<p>To do this take your <strong>assessable weekly earnings</strong> and deduct
€20 per day for each day you have worked up to a maximum of €60 (3 days).
Next get 60% of the balance. This amount is your <strong>weekly means from
work</strong>. </p>

<p>Assessable weekly earnings - €20 per day = total x 60% = weekly means from
work.</p>

<p>You then work out what the maximum Jobseeker’s Allowance payment for your
situation would be. You get this by adding together the maximum payment for
yourself plus any increases for a qualified adult and any qualified children.
If your weekly means are less than this figure then your daily means are
calculated to find the <strong>actual</strong> amount of Jobseeker’s
Allowance you will get. </p>

<p><strong>If your weekly means <em>from all sources</em> are greater</strong>
than the maximum Jobseeker’s Allowance payment for your situation then you
will <strong>not</strong> get Jobseeker’s Allowance.</p>

<h4>What happens if my partner is getting a social welfare payment?</h4>

<p>If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant has a social welfare payment in
their own right (except Child Benefit, Disablement Pension, <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/death_related_benefits/guardians_payments.html">guardian's
payments</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary
Welfare Allowance</a>, <a href="../../social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/domiciliary_care_allowance.html">Domiciliary
Care Allowance</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/carers/half_rate_carers_allowance.html">half-rate Carer's
Allowance</a>) or is on a FET or VTOS course and getting a payment in their own
right you <strong>cannot</strong> claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult for
them. </p>

<p>This means that the maximum you can be paid is the maximum Jobseeker’s
Allowance payment for a single person plus a half-rate allowance for each
qualified child. (Your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant will get a half-rate
payment for each qualified child with their payment.)</p>

<p>In addition only 50% of your combined means are taken into account in the
means test for your Jobseeker’s Allowance - in other words <strong>your
combined means are halved</strong>. (The other half will be taken into account
in the means test for your partner's payment if your partner is getting a
means-tested payment.) </p>

<p>You can claim an increase for your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant while
they are taking part in a <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/community_employment_scheme.html">Community
Employment (CE)</a>, Tús or Gateway scheme. Their earnings from the scheme are
assessed in the same way as earnings from insurable employment (and your
combined means are not halved). </p>

<p>However if you are claiming Jobseeker's Allowance and your spouse or partner
is getting one of the social welfare payments listed below, the total amount
paid cannot be more than would be payable if only one of you was claiming and
the other was an adult dependant.</p>
<ul><li>Jobseeker's Allowance</li>
  <li>Farm Assist</li>
  <li>Illness Benefit</li>
  <li>Disablement Pension (when paid with Injury Benefit or Incapacity
    Supplement)</li>
  <li>Injury Benefit</li>
  <li>Invalidity Pension</li>
  <li>State Pension (Non-Contributory)</li>
  <li>State Pension (Contributory)</li>
  <li>State Pension (Transition)</li>
  <li>Jobseeker's Benefit</li>
</ul><p></p>

<h3>Part 2: Calculate how work will affect your Jobseeker’s Allowance</h3>

<p>If you are entitled to Jobseeker’s Allowance, you then calculate how work
will affect your payment. </p>

<p><strong>1. Calculate your average daily earnings</strong> <br>
To calculate your average daily earnings get your total <strong>weekly
assessable earnings</strong> from employment and divide by the number of days
you worked that week (including Sunday). </p>

<p>Total weekly earnings ÷ number of days worked = average daily earnings.</p>

<p><strong>2. Next calculate your daily means from work<br></strong>To calculate your daily means from work, you must first disregard any
income not taken into account. €20 is not taken into account for days worked.
Next get 60% of the balance. This is assessed as your daily means from work.
</p>

<p>Average daily earnings - €20 = total x 60% = daily means from work.</p>

<p><strong>3. Finally, find your weekly means from work<br></strong>To find your weekly means from work, multiply your daily means by the
number of days worked. </p>

<p>Daily means from work x number of days worked = <strong>weekly means from
work</strong>.</p>

<p>Remember that this figure must be halved if your spouse, civil partner or
cohabitant is getting a social welfare payment in their own right (see above
for details). </p>

<h3><strong>Sunday work</strong></h3>

<p>Since 20 February 2013 work on Sunday is now included so:</p>
<ol><li>You include your earnings from Sunday when working out your assessable
    weekly earnings and when you are checking to see whether your assessable
    weekly earnings are over the limit</li>
  <li>You include Sunday when calculating your average daily earnings and when
    calculating your daily means or weekly means from work</li>
</ol><p><strong>Public holidays</strong></p>

<p>If you work part-time, your employer must pay you for the <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/public_holidays_in_ireland.html">public
holidays</a> which you don’t work, as long as, you have worked at least 40
hours in the 5 weeks immediately before the week of the public holiday. If you
are paid for a public holiday (whether you work on that day or not) this is
counted as a day of work. If you are claiming a jobseeker’s payment for a
period which includes a public holiday and you do not qualify for a payment
from your employer, then you can qualify for a jobseeker’s payment for that
day.</p>

<p>If you get paid for a public holiday and don't work that day, it will be
included in the number of days worked to find your weekly means from work.
Depending on your means, you can continue to get Jobseeker’s Allowance for
the other days you do not work. If you work more than 3 days in a week you do
not qualify for JA for that week.</p>

<h3>How much Jobseeker’s Allowance you get</h3>

<p>Subtract your weekly means from the maximum Jobseeker’s Allowance payment
for your situation to find out how much Jobseeker’s Allowance you will
get.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The maximum weekly rate of Jobseeker’s Allowance
for your circumstances is the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Publications/sw19/Pages/sw19_sect6.aspx">maximum
rate of Jobseeker’s Allowance and any increases for your adult dependant and
child dependants</a>. If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is getting a
social welfare payment in their own right an increase for a qualified adult is
<strong>not</strong> included in the maximum Jobseeker’s Allowance payment
for your situation and you will only get a <strong>half-rate increase</strong>
for each qualified child.</p>

<p>If you have other means in addition to means from work they will also be
taken into account and will affect how much Jobseeker’s Allowance you will
get.</p>

<h3>Worksheet</h3>

<p>You may find our <a shape="rect" href="../../../reference/worksheets/worksheet_jobseekers_allowance_and_income_from_work.html">Worksheet
to help you calculate your means from work for Jobseeker's Allowance</a>
useful. </p>

<h3>Seasonal earnings</h3>

<p>The definition of seasonal employment is that: </p>
<ul><li>It is created annually as a result of a particular seasonal variation in
    the amount of work, and terminates at the end of that season. </li>
  <li>The start and end dates may vary from season to season and from worker to
    worker, but overall there should be a clearly discernible beginning and end
    to the season. </li>
  <li>The length of the season should not generally exceed six months. </li>
</ul><p>In determining whether a person is involved in seasonal employment the
nature of the business is investigated, as well as the nature of the person's
employment.</p>

<p>Some of the typical areas where seasonal employments exist are turf
harvesting with Bord na Mona, fish processing and hotels, restaurants and shops
in areas where there is a limited tourist season. </p>

<p>Once the season is over, the means from seasonal employment are excluded
from the assessment until the commencement of the next season.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lee4ad">Spouse’s, civil partner’s or
cohabitant's income from work</h2>

<p>Your spouse's, civil partner's or cohabitant's income from employment is
assessed in the means test for Jobseeker’s Allowance. </p>

<p>Their income from work is assessed in the same way as your income from work
(if any). To work out what your spouse's, civil partner's or cohabitant's means
from work is:</p>
<ul><li>Deduct €20 per day from your spouse's, civil partner's or cohabitant's
    assessable earnings for each day worked up to a maximum of €60 (including
    Sunday) </li>
  <li>Next get 60% of the balance. This is assessed as his or her weekly means
    from work. </li>
</ul><p>Assessable weekly earnings - €20 per day (maximum €60 for 3 days work) =
total x 60% = weekly means from work. </p>

<p>Your spouse's, civil partner's or cohabitant's income from self-employment
is fully assessed in the means test for Jobseeker’s Allowance and there are
no disregards. </p>

<p>Earnings are assessed as gross income less work related expenses over 12
months. The expected annual earnings from self-employment is divided by 52 to
find your spouse's, civil partner's or cohabitant's weekly means from
self-employment. </p>

<h3>Getting Jobseeker's Allowance before 26 September 2007</h3>

<p>If you were getting Jobseeker's Allowance before 26 September 2007 and you
were still in payment on 26 September, your income and your spouse's, civil
partner's or cohabitant's income will be assessed using both the old means test
and the new means test. You will get the higher amount. (The old means test is
the means test used before 26 September 2007. The new means test is used on JA
applications recieved after 26 September 2007). </p>

<p>If you would get a greater amount of JA on the previous assessment then you
will continue to be assessed using the previous method of calculating means
from employment.</p>

<p>If you stop claiming Jobseeker's Allowance for more than 4 weeks you cannot
apply the old method of calculating means from employment. If the first time
you stop claiming JA is for less than 4 weeks, the second time you stop
claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (even if it is for less than 4 weeks) you will
be assessed using the new assessment only. This means, if you want to be
assessed using the previous method you are only allowed one break in your claim
of less than 4 weeks </p>

<p><strong>Before 26 September 2007 your spouse's, civil partner's or
cohabitant's income from employment affected your JA payment as
follows:</strong></p>

<p>If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant works and earns less than €100
gross per week, you are entitled to a full increase for him/her as a qualified
adult. A reduced <a shape="rect" href="../claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">qualified
adult allowance</a> is paid if his/her earnings are between €100 and €310.
If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant earns more than €310, you will
not be paid any increase for him/her. If you have a child dependant and you are
getting a <a shape="rect" href="../claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_and_increase_in_your_payment_for_a_child_dependant.html">child
dependant increase</a> in your payment, this portion is halved if your spouse,
civil partner or cohabitant earns more than €310. </p>

Your spouse's, civil partner's or cohabitant's income can also affect your
payment. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/OperationalGuidelines/Pages/JA_ass_sppart_ern.aspx">Read
more about how your spouse's, civil partner's or cohabitant's income from
employment is assessed as means and possibly affect your Jobseeker's
Allowance.</a></p>

<p>Your average weekly net earnings are used to calculate your means. This is
usually established by calculating your average earning over the previous 13
weeks (or another period if this is more representative of your normal working
pattern). When assessing your income from employment the following allowances
are always deducted from your gross earnings to get your net earnings. </p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="../social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">PRSI
    (Contribution)</a> </li>
  <li>Union dues </li>
  <li>Reasonable travel expenses </li>
  <li>Superannuation or contribution to a private health insurance fund </li>
</ul><p>How your income from employment is assessed depends on whether you have
child dependants. </p>

<p>If you have one or more qualified child dependants and you are working part
of the week while claiming JA, your means are assessed as 60% of your average
net weekly earnings. </p>

<p>If you do not have qualified child dependants, €12.70 euro of your
earnings for each day worked are not taken into account and disregarded from
your average net weekly earnings. Only 60% of the balance is assessed against
the weekly rate of JA.</p>

<p>A person is entitled to JA only for periods of unemployment. The minimum
period a person must be unemployed in order to receive JA is 3 days in a period
of 6 consecutive days.</p>

<h3>Getting JA before 20 November 1996<br></h3>

<p>If you were getting JA on 20 November 1996 and have continued to get JA
continuously, you can continue to be assessed using the method of calculating
means from employment in place at that time to find out if you would get a
greater amount of JA. </p>

<p>If your means have changed, for any reason since the 20 November 1996, you
cannot apply this method of calculating means from employment.</p>

<p><strong>Before 20 November 1996 your spouse's, civil partner's or
cohabitant's income from employment affected your JA payment as
follows:</strong></p>

<p>The following method of assessing means from insurable employment applies if
you were getting JA on the 20th November 1996 and have continued to get JA
continuously and if this method of assessment is of greater benefit than that
under the current method of assessment of earnings from work. If your means
have changed, for any reason since the 20th November 1996, the saver rate will
not apply.</p>

<p>The following is how your means are assessed using the Saver Clause:</p>
<ul><li>Your pattern of employment is established (that is, your average number
    of days worked each week) </li>
  <li>Average net weekly earnings are established (i.e. gross earnings less
    income tax, PRSI, VHI, BUPA, HSF, superannuation and union dues) </li>
  <li>A certain amount of your average net weekly earnings are not taken into
    account, this is called an earnings disregard. One-sixth of the maximum
    weekly rate of Job Seeker's Allowance plus €19.05 for each day worked. If
    you work Sunday only €19.05 is not taken into account. </li>
  <li>The total amount disregarded is deducted from the net earnings and the
    balance is taken as your weekly means.</li>

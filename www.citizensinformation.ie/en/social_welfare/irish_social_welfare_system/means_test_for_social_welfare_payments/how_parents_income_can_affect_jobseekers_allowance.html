<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>When you apply for Jobseeker's Allowance, your <a shape="rect" href="means_test.html">means</a> are assessed to see whether you will qualify.
If you are 24 years of age or under and you are living with a parent or a
step-parent in the family home, your parents' income is also taken into
account. The Department of Social Protection call this an assessment of the
<em>benefit and privilege</em> you get from living with your parents. </p>

<p>This means, while you may have no income, your parents' income can affect
your social welfare payment. If however your only means are from the benefit of
your parents' income and those means are <strong>less</strong> than the
personal rate of Jobseeker's Allowance, the minimum weekly payment you are
entitled to is €40. </p>

<p>Some people may still refer to <em>benefit and privilege</em> as 'board and
lodgings'.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To be assessed for benefit and privilege you must:</p>
<ul><li>Be 24 years of age or under </li>
  <li>Be living with a parent or step-parent in the family home </li>
  <li>Have applied for <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s
    Allowance (JA)</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary
    Welfare Allowance (SWA)</a>. </li>
</ul><p><strong>If you are living with your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant and
living with your parents you will not be assessed for benefit and privilege,
even if you are under 25 years of age. </strong></p>

<p><strong>If you have lived elsewhere in Ireland (or abroad) independent of
your parents for at least 3 years, benefit and privilege is assessed as
€7.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l1ee71">How to calculate benefit and privilege</h2>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>, add together your parents' net income from all
sources. (Net income is your gross income less income tax, PRSI, <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/income_levy.html">Universal
Social Charge</a>, private health insurance contribution, superannuation and
union dues).</p>

<p>For example, your parents' net income includes income from:</p>
<ul><li>Insurable employment </li>
  <li>Self-employment </li>
  <li>Community Employment (CE) schemes and SOLAS (formerly FÁS) training
    allowances </li>
  <li>Maintenance payments </li>
  <li>An occupational pension </li>
  <li>All social welfare payments with the exception of the following: National
    Fuel Allowance, Child Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and Respite Care
    Grant. </li>
  <li>All Health Service Executive Payments with the exception of the
    following: Blind Welfare Allowance and Foster Care Alllowance. </li>
  <li>Net income from property other than the family home. So, for example,
    rental income (less expenses such as mortgage repayments, insurance costs
    and repairs) is taken into account. The capital value of property is not
    taken into account. </li>
</ul><p>Capital assessment: Capital usually includes saving, investments and
property (other than your home). Capital which belongs to your parents is not
taken into account in the assessment of benefit and privilege. </p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>, deduct the following from your parent’s net
income to get their assessable income:</p>
<ul><li>Rent or mortgage repayments </li>
  <li>Standard weekly allowance of €600 for a two-parent family or €470 for
    a one-parent family </li>
  <li>€30 for each child up to 18 years of age and for all children over 18
    years in full-time education. However, you cannot deduct €30 for a child
    who is getting a social welfare payment in his/her own right. For example,
    if there is a child 17 years of age and getting Disability Allowance in the
    household, you cannot deduct €30 from parental weekly income for this
    child. The child's social welfare payment is <strong>not</strong> included
    as income. </li>
</ul><p><strong>Step 3</strong>, after you have calculated your parents' assessable
income, get 34% of this income. Only <strong>34% </strong>of your parents'
assessable income is taken into account and assessed as benefit and privilege.
You subtract this amount from the standard rate of Jobseeker's Allowance for
your circumstances to find out how much, if any, you qualify for. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l68942">An example showing how to calculate
benefit and privilege</h2>

<p><u>Example 1</u></p>

<p>A one-parent family with 4 children. Two of the children are still in
school, one child in an apprenticeship and the claimant (The claimant is 24
years of age and applying for Jobseeker's Allowance). </p>

<p>Parent’s net weekly income €590<br>
Less deductions from net income<strong>*</strong> <u>€630<br></u>Total -€40</p>

<p><strong>*</strong>Less weekly mortgage repayments of €100 and weekly
disregard for children of €60 (€30 x 2 children) and one-parent standard
weekly allowance of €470 (€100 + €60 + €470 = €630).</p>

<p>In this case, parental income of €590 is less than the total amount of
deductions, which is €630. Therefore, parental income is assessed as NIL and
will not affect the Jobseeker's Allowance claim. </p>

<p><u>Example 2</u></p>

<p>If we take the same situation of a one-parent family with 4 children. Two of
the children are still in school, one child in an apprenticeship and the fourth
is the claimant (who is 24 years of age and applying for Jobseeker's
Allowance). If we increase the parent's income to €800 per week, benefit and
privilege is calculated as follows:</p>

<p>Parent’s net weekly income €800<br>
Less deductions from net income* <u>€630<br></u>Total €170</p>

<p><strong>*</strong>Less weekly mortgage repayments of €100 and weekly
disregard for children of €60 (€30 x 2 children) and one-parent standard
weekly allowance of €470 (€100 + €60 + €470 = €630).</p>

<p>34% of the above total of €170 = €58 (rounded up from €57.8)</p>

<p>Maximum weekly Jobseeker's Allowance payment €100 less €58 = €42 (see
'Note' below)</p>

<p><strong>Amount of Jobseeker's Allowance payable to claimant =
€42</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> People under 26 get an age-related rate of
Jobseeker's Allowance. More information on the JA rates for people under 26 can
be found in our document on <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
Allowance</a>.</p>

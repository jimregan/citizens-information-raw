<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Men and women are required by law to maintain their dependants. Maintenance
can be paid voluntarily or as a result of a <em>maintenance order</em> granted
by the courts. More information about how to apply for and enforce maintenance
is available in our document <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/separation_and_divorce/maintenance_orders_and_agreements.html">'Maintenance
orders and agreements'</a>.</p>

<p>If you are applying for a <a shape="rect" href="../social_assistance_payments/social_assistance_in_ireland.html">social
assistance payment</a> you must satisfy a means test. All your sources of
income (for example, employment, capital, cash income and maintenance) are
assessed by the Department of Social Protection (DSP). This document explains
how maintenance is assessed in the means test. More information on other
sources of income and how they are assessed is available in our document on the
<a shape="rect" href="means_test.html">means test</a>. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>
Maintenance is assessed as means when you apply for the following payments: 
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
    Allowance</a> (JA) </li>
  <li><a href="../../social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance_transition.html">Jobseeker’s
    Transitional payment</a> (JST)</li>

    Pension (Non-Contributory)</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/death_related_benefits/widows_non_contrib_pen.html">Widow's,
    Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Non-Contributory) Pension</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability

  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent
    Family Payment</a> (OFP) </li>
</ul><p>All income from maintenance is assessed as means. This includes both
maintenance for you and maintenance to you for any of your children. If you are
getting maintenance from more than one person it will be added together and the
total will be assessed as means. Maintenance paid to your spouse, civil partner
or cohabitant is also taken into account as means. </p>

<h3>Maintenance not taken into account</h3>

<p>Half of all maintenance paid is disregarded or not taken into account in the
means test. In addition your rent or mortgage repayment up to a maximum of
€95.23 per week can be offset against maintenance payments. Half the balance
of maintenance is then assessed as means and your social welfare payment will
be reduced by that amount. You must provide proof of rent or mortgage
payments.</p>

<p>If you do not have any housing costs half of your means from maintenance is
assessed. </p>

<h3>Getting a payment before 2003</h3>

<p>If you were getting one of the payments listed above before 2003 you may
qualify to have your maintenance assessed using the old rules. The Department
of Social Protection provides more detailed information about these rules and
the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/OperationalGuidelines/Pages/meansassess.aspx#sect2">assessment
of maintenance as means</a>.</p>

<h2>How maintenance is assessed for Rent Supplement </h2>

<p>In the means test for <a href="../../social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a> maintenance is assessed as additional household income and
maintenance payments up to €95.23 per week are assessed in full. The
household income disregard applies to maintenance payments above this
amount.</p>

<p><strong>Household income disregard:</strong> A certain amount of your
household income above the SWA rate for your situation is not taken into
account. €75 of any additional household income is not taken into account and
25% of additional household income over €75 is not taken into account. There
is no upper limit on the amount that can be disregarded. <a href="../../social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/calculating_rent_supplement.html">Read
more about calculating Rent Supplement.</a></p>

<h2>How maintenance is assessed for Family Income Supplement</h2>

<p>If you are getting maintenance, the total amount of your maintenance payment
(including payments for children) will be assessed as income for <a href="../../social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
Income Supplement (FIS)</a>. Only one FIS payment can be made in respect of any
family. This means that if you are applying for FIS the parent from whom you
are getting maintenance must not be getting FIS. </p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2>How maintenance is assessed for a child with a means-tested social
assistance payment </h2>

<p>If you are getting <strong>Jobseeker's Allowance</strong> any maintenance
paid to your parent on your behalf is assessed as <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/OperationalGuidelines/Pages/ua_benpriv.aspx">benefit
and privilege</a> against you. If a portion of the maintenance is paid directly
to you this portion is assessed as cash income against you and the remainder
which is paid to your parent is assessed as benefit and privilege. </p>

<p>If you are getting <strong>Disability Allowance</strong> any maintenance in
the form of cash income from either parent is assessable as means.<br></p>

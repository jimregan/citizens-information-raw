<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>When you apply for a social assistance or means-tested payment your income
is assessed to see whether you qualify. If you are 24 years of age or under and
are living with a parent or a step-parent in the family home your parents'
income will also be taken into account. The Department of Social Protection
call this an assessment of the <em>benefit and privilege</em> you get from
living with your parents.</p>

<p>This means that though you may have no income, your parents' income can
affect your social welfare payment. Some people may still refer to <em>benefit
and privilege</em> as 'board and lodgings'.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To be assessed for benefit and privilege you must be:</p>
<ul><li>24 years of age or under </li>
  <li>Living with a parent or step-parent in the family home </li>
  <li>Have applied for <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary
    Welfare Allowance (SWA)</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s
    Allowance (JA)</a> </li>
</ul></div>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="la35e1">How to calculate benefit and privilege </h2>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>, add together your parents' net income from all
sources. (Net income is your gross income less income tax, PRSI, Universal
Social Charge, private health insurance contribution, superannuation and union
dues).</p>

<p>For example, your parents' net income includes income from:</p>
<ul><li>Insurable employment </li>
  <li>Self-employment </li>
  <li>Community Employment (CE) schemes and SOLAS (formerly FÁS) training
    allowances </li>
  <li>Maintenance payments </li>
  <li>An occupational pension </li>
  <li>All social welfare payments with the exception of the following: Fuel
    Allowance, Child Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and Respite Care
    Grant. </li>
  <li>All Health Service Executive Payments except for: Blind Welfare
    Allowance, Mobility Allowance and Foster Care Alllowance. </li>
  <li>Net income from property other than the family home. So, for example,
    rental income (less expenses such as mortgage repayments, insurance costs
    and repairs) is taken into account. The capital value of any property is
    not taken into account.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Step 2</strong>, deduct the following from your parent’s net
income to get their assessable income:</p>
<ul><li>Rent or mortgage repayments </li>
  <li>Standard weekly allowance of €600 for a two-parent family or €470 for
    a one-parent family </li>
  <li>€30 for each child up to 18 years of age and for all children over 18
    years in full time education. However, you cannot deduct €30 for a child
    who is getting a social welfare payment in his/her own right. For example,
    if there is a child 17 years of age and getting Disability Allowance in the
    household, you cannot deduct €30 from parental weekly income for this
    child. The child's social welfare payment is not included as income. </li>
</ul><p><strong>Step 3</strong>, after you have calculated your parents' assessable
income, get 34% of this income. Only <strong>34%</strong> of your parents'
assessable income is taken into account and assessed as benefit and privilege.
You subtract this amount from the standard rate of SWA for your circumstances
to find out how much, if any, you qualify for. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l68942">An example showing how to calculate
benefit and privilege</h2>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>A one-parent family with 4 children. Two of the children are still in
school, one child in an apprenticeship and the claimant (that is, the person
aged 24 or under who is applying for Supplementary Welfare Allowance). </p>

<p>Parent’s net weekly income €590<br>
Less deductions from net income* <u>€630<br></u>Total -€40</p>

<p>*Less weekly mortgage repayments of €100 and weekly disregard for children
of €60 (€30 x 2 children) and one-parent standard weekly allowance of
€470 (€100 + €60 + €470 = €630).</p>

<p>In this case, parental income of €590 is less than the total amount of
deductions, which is €630. Therefore, parental income is assessed as NIL and
will not affect the Supplementary Welfare Allowance claim. </p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>If we take the same situation of a one-parent family with 4 children. Two of
the children are still in school, one child in an apprenticeship and the fourth
is the claimant (that is, the person aged 24 or under who is applying for
Supplementary Welfare Allowance). If we increase the parent's income to €800
per week, benefit and privilege is calculated as follows:</p>

<p>Parent’s net weekly income €800<br>
Less deductions from net income* <u>€630</u><br>
Total €170</p>

<p>*Less weekly mortgage repayments of €100 and weekly disregard for children
of €60 (€30 x 2 children) and one-parent standard weekly allowance of
€470 (€100 + €60 + €470 = €630).</p>

<p>34% of the above total of €144 = €58 (rounded up from €57.80)</p>

<p>Maximum weekly Supplementary Welfare Allowance payment €100 less €58 =
€42 (see 'Note' below)</p>

<p><strong>Amount of Supplementary Welfare Allowance</strong> <strong>payable
to claimant = €42</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> People under 26 get an age related rate of
Supplementary Welfare Allowance. More information on the SWA rates for people
under 26 can be found in our document on <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary
Welfare Allowance</a>.</p>

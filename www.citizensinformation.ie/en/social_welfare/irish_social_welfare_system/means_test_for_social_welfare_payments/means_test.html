<p>To qualify for a social assistance payment you must satisfy a means test and
a <a shape="rect" href="../social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitual
residence test</a>. </p>

<p>A means test is a way of checking if you have enough financial resources to
support yourself and what amount of social assistance payment, if any, you may
qualify for. In a means test the Department of Social Protection examines all
your sources of income.</p>

<p>How your means is calculated and the amount of means you are allowed to have
varies from payment to payment. This document gives a general overview of the
means test. </p>

<p>Sometimes a certain amount of income or income from particular sources is
not taken into account and these are often referred to as income disregards.
Disregards can differ from payment to payment – we list the most important
ones in the information on each payment and there is a full list in our
document, <a href="cash_income_not_included_in_the_social_welfare_means_test.html">Cash
income not included in the means test</a>.</p>

<h2>How is the means test carried out?</h2>

<p>When you apply for a means-tested social welfare payment you must fill out
an application form. This form asks for information about sources of income.
You must give details of all your means when completing the application form
for a social welfare payment. The Department of Social Protection (DSP) can ask
you for details of the bank accounts you hold, including the account numbers.
The DSP does not access your bank account unless you give permission.</p>

<p>A Social Welfare Inspector may interview you about your income and may ask
you for supporting documents, such as bank statements or accounts. This may
involve a visit to your home.</p>

<p>All your sources of income are added together and taken into account when
deciding whether you qualify for a means-tested payment. The decision on your
means is made by a separate Deciding Officer. You will be told how exactly your
means were assessed. If you are not satisfied, you may appeal to the Social
Welfare Appeals Office.</p>

<p>Once your <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Topics/payments/Pages/AssessmentofMeans.aspx">means
have been assessed as a certain amount</a> and you have been awarded a social
welfare payment you are responsible for telling the DSP about any changes in
your circumstances. If you do not you may be liable for fines or asked to <a href="../claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/recovery_of_social_welfare_overpayments.html">repay
any overpayment</a> that may have occurred.</p>

<p>The means test for a social assistance payment can be a complex calculation
and it can differ from payment to payment. Here we look generally at the way
income from different sources is assessed in the means test.</p>

  <col><tbody><tr><td><strong>Assessing the means of a couple</strong> 

        <p>If you apply for a <a href="../social_assistance_payments/social_assistance_in_ireland.html">social
        assistance or means-tested payment</a> and you are married, in a civil
        partnership or cohabitating, the means of your spouse, civil partner or
        cohabitant are also taken into account in the means test. You can read
        more in our document, <a href="assessing_the_means_of_a_couple.html">Assessing the means of a
        couple for social assistance payments</a>.</p>

        <p>If you apply for a <a href="../social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social
        insurance payment</a>, you do not have to satisfy a means test.
        However, if you wish to apply for an increase in your payment for <a href="../claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">an

        dependants (qualified children)</a> your spouse's, civil partner's or
        cohabitant's means will be assessed. Your means are not taken into
        account but any means you hold jointly will be assessed.</p>
      </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><h2>How cash income is assessed</h2>

<p>The means test assesses all cash income that you expect to get in the
forthcoming year. In practice, this is usually assessed by calculating the
income you actually received in the previous year. Cash income that is assessed
includes any income from employment or self-employment, including farm income,
income from a social security pension from another country and <a href="maintenance_and_social_welfare_payments.html">maintenance
payments</a>.</p>

<p>None of the payments made by the Department of Social Protection (DSP) are
taken into account. You can read more about what cash income is not included in
the means test in our document, <a href="cash_income_not_included_in_the_social_welfare_means_test.html">Cash
income not included in the means test</a>.</p>

<h3>Income from employment</h3>

<p>How your income from employment or self employment is assessed depends on
the payment you are applying for. When assessing your income from employment
the following are always deducted from your gross earnings:</p>
<ul><li>PRSI</li>
  <li>Union dues</li>
  <li>Superannuation or contribution to a pension fund</li>
</ul><p>In the case of self-employment:</p>
<ul><li>PRSI (Class S)</li>
  <li>All expenses directly related to your self-employment. However, drawings,
    that is money taken from the business for personal use, is assessed as
    means.</li>
</ul><p>Income tax or <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">the
Universal Social Charge</a> is not usually deducted from your income from
employment, except in the assessment of <a shape="rect" href="../../payments_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
Income Supplement</a> and in the <a shape="rect" href="how_parents_income_can_affect_jobseekers_allowance.html">assessment of
benefit and privilege for Jobseeker's Allowance</a> and <a shape="rect" href="how_parents_income_can_affect_supplementary_welfare_allowance.html">benefit
and privilege for Supplementary Welfare Allowance</a>.</p>

<p>There are additional income disregards for individual payments. For example:
€120 per week of rehabilitative earnings is not taken into account for <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability
Allowance</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/disability_and_illness/blind_persons_pension.html">Blind
Pension</a>. There are also additional income disregards for <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/carers/carers_allowance.html">Carer's Allowance</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/unemployed_people/preta.html">Pre-Retirement
Allowance</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/older_and_retired_people/state_pension_non_contributory.html">State
Pension (Non-Contributory)</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../../payments_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent
Family Payment</a>. </p>

<p>The assessment of income from employment for Jobseeker's Allowance is a
little more complex. More information is available in our document <a shape="rect" href="work_and_jobseekers_allowance.html">Work and Jobseeker's
Allowance</a>. </p>

<p>Income from working as a home-help is taken into account in the means test
for social welfare payments from 2012.</p>

<h3>Income from maintenance</h3>

<p>For most social welfare payments any income from maintenance is assessed as
means. This includes maintenance for you and maintenance to you for any of your
children. Maintenance paid to your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is also
taken into account as means. However rent or mortgage payments of up to
€95.23 per week can be offset against maintenance payments. You can read more
about <a href="maintenance_and_social_welfare_payments.html">Maintenance and
social welfare payments</a>.</p>

<h3>Income from farming</h3>

<p>If you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant are getting income from
working a farm the yearly value to you is assessed (this is gross income minus
expenses). If the land is worked but is not being worked to its potential then
an estimate of the potential net yearly value is made.</p>

<p>If you are leasing a farm you own, the rental income is assessed.</p>

<p>If you are not working or leasing a farm the capital value of the land is
assessed.</p>

<h2>How property personally used (your home) is assessed</h2>

<p>The house in which you live is not included in the assessment of your means
unless you are getting an income from it. If you have rented a room in the
house, that income is assessed. You can deduct 5% of the gross rent you receive
for wear and tear and 15% can be allowed for voids (vacant periods between
lettings). However, if you are getting a State Pension (Non-Contributory) or a
Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Non-Contributory) Pension and
would otherwise be living alone; the income is not assessed at all.</p>

<p>If you use or rent a room in your home for business purposes you can deduct
a proportional amount of ground rent and mortgage interest from the profits you
receive.</p>

<p>If you sell your home, the proceeds of the sale would normally be taken into
account. However, if you are getting certain payments and you sell your house
in order to buy or rent more suitable alternative accommodation or to go into a
nursing home or to move in with a person who is getting Carer's Allowance for
you, the first €190,500 of the sale proceeds is not taken into account. </p>

<p>This exemption only applies if you are getting one of the following
payments:</p>
<ul><li>State Pension (Non-Contributory) </li>
  <li>Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Non-Contributory)
    Pension (if you are 66 years of age or over) </li>
  <li>One-Parent Family Payment (if you are 66 years of age or over) </li>
  <li>Disability Allowance </li>
  <li>Blind Pension </li>
</ul><p>You can read more about how proceeds from the sale of your home are treated
in our document <a href="how_to_assess_your_means_from_capital_for_social_welfare_payments.html">Capital
and social welfare payments</a>.</p>

<h2>How capital and property not personally used is assessed</h2>

<p>Capital includes <strong>property</strong> (except for your own home),
<strong>savings</strong> and <strong>investments</strong>.</p>

<p>If you (or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant) own property that you
are not personally using or if you have investments or any other form of
capital, the value is assessed, using a standard formula. You may or may not be
getting an income from the property or investment. (The only exception to this
is where an Increase for a Qualified Adult is being assessed for a social
insurance payment. In this case, if a property is let the rental income is
assessed rather than the capital value.)</p>

<p>The property and investments that may be assessed under this heading include
savings in a bank account (or anywhere else), a house that you have let and
stocks and shares. If you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant saves a
portion of your social welfare payment each week, these savings as well as
savings from most other sources will be taken into account as part of your
means.</p>

<p>The standard formula for assessing the value of capital for all social
welfare payments (except <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability
Allowance</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary
Welfare Allowance</a>) is: </p>

    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Balance</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€4 per €1,000</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>For Disability Allowance the first €50,000 of capital is not taken into
account. For Supplementary Welfare Allowance the first €5,000 of capital is
not taken into account. Capital is not assessed in the means test for Family
Income Supplement. </p>

and social welfare payments</a>. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title">Total means</h2>

<p>Your means under the various headings (for example, cash income, employment
and capital) are added together to find your total means. For most means-tested
payments, the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Publications/sw19/Pages/sw19_intro.aspx">rate of
social welfare payment</a> you can get, if any, is reduced on a sliding scale
according to your means.</p>

<p>If you are under 26 and applying for Jobseeker’s Allowance or for
Supplementary Welfare Allowance your age can also determine the maximum payment
for your situation.</p>

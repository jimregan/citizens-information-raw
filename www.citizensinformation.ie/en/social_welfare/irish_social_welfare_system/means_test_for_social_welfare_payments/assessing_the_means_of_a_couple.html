<p>If you are married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting the Department of
Social Protection (DSP) will assess both of your means when carrying out a
means test for a social assistance payment. This is the case even if only one
of you is actually claiming a payment.</p>

<p>For some social assistance payments the DSP adds all of your means together
and then halves them to get the assessable means for each one of you. For
others the DSP adds all your means together and then assesses them against the
maximum household payment for your circumstances.</p>

<p>This document gives a general overview of how the means test is carried out
for couples; you should also read the document on the individual payment which
will give more detail on income not taken into account (or disregarded) for
each payment.</p>

<p>For more general information you can read our document on <a href="means_test.html">the means test</a>. If you are getting a social
insurance payment such as Jobseeker's Benefit or State Pension (Contributory)
and wish to claim a payment for your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant only
their means will be tested. You can find out more about claiming a payment for
a qualified adult with a social insurance payment in our document, <a href="../claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">Claiming
for an adult dependant</a>.</p>

<p>Note that in general if you have a joint account with your spouse, civil
partner or cohabitant, legally the total amount in the account is owned by each
of you. Therefore it can be assessed in full against each of you. However, if
you are both getting means-tested payments it will be assessed on a shared
basis or against only one of you.</p>

<h3>Blind Pension, State Pension (Non-Contributory) and Carer's Allowance</h3>

<p>For Blind Pension, State Pension (Non-Contributory) and Carer's Allowance
your means are taken to be <strong>half</strong> of the total means of yourself
and your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant. If one of the couple is employed
away from home, but returns home periodically and regularly contributes to the
support of the other member, the means would generally be assessed on the basis
of half the combined means of the couple. </p>

<p>All your sources of income are added together and 50% of the total is taken
to be your means. When assessing your means from capital your combined capital
is halved and this lower amount is assessed using the standard formula. The
resulting amount is then doubled before being added to your other sources of
income.</p>

<table border="1"><caption></caption>
  <col><tbody><tr><td><strong>Example of assessment of means from capital </strong></td>
    </tr><tr><td>John has €30,000 savings and his wife Mary has €10,000 savings.
        They also have a joint account with €10,000. Mary has applied for
        Carer's Allowance. Her means from capital is assessed as follows: 

        <p>€30,000 + €10,000 + €10,000 = €50,000</p>

        <p>€50,000 ÷ 2 = €25,000</p>

        <p>€25,000 assessed using the formula above = €5</p>

        <p>€5 x 2 = €10</p>

        <p>Mary’s weekly means from capital is assessed as €10</p>

        <p>(At the end of the means calculation all Mary and John's sources of
        income will be added together to get the couple's total means. This
        figure will then be halved to see whether Mary qualifies for Carer's
        Allowance.)</p>
      </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<h3>Jobseeker's Allowance, Disability Allowance, Pre-Retirement Allowance or
Farm Assist</h3>

<p>If you are getting Jobseeker's Allowance, Disability Allowance,
Pre-Retirement Allowance or Farm Assist your means are assessed differently.
Even if your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is not dependent on you and
has income in his or her own right you are entitled to claim a payment for them
and for any dependent children you may have. Any assessable income they may
have is subtracted from the maximum weekly rate of payment for your
circumstances.</p>

<p>For example, if you are married and have two children and apply for JA, the
maximum family payment you could get is €380.70 (this figure is made up of
personal rate of €193 plus a qualified adult rate of €128.10 and two
qualified child increases of €29.80). Any assessable income you or your
spouse has is deducted from this family payment. (Income from some sources is
not assessed and there are disregards for income from employment, see our
document, <a href="work_and_jobseekers_allowance.html">Work and Jobseeker's
Allowance</a> for more information.)</p>

<p>However if your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant has a social welfare
payment in their own right (with some exceptions such as Child Benefit,
Domiciliary Care Allowance, and Supplementary Welfare Allowance) you
<em>cannot</em> claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult for them. This means
you are paid as a single person plus a half-rate increase for each qualified
child. (Your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant will get a half-rate increase
for each qualified child with their payment.) In this case only 50% of your
combined means are taken into account in the means test.</p>

<p>Note, however, that if you are claiming Jobseeker's Allowance and your
spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is getting one of the social welfare
payments listed below, the total amount paid to you as a couple cannot be more
than the maximum amount that would be paid to one person (including adult and
child dependants) on one social welfare payment. You can choose which payment
is most advantageous.</p>
<ul><li>Illness Benefit</li>
  <li>Disablement Pension (when paid with Illness Benefit or Incapacity
    Supplement)</li>
  <li>Injury Benefit</li>
  <li>Invalidity Pension</li>
  <li>State Pension (Non-Contributory)</li>
  <li>State Pension (Contributory)</li>
  <li>State Pension (Transition)</li>
  <li>Jobseeker's Benefit</li>
  <li>Jobseeker's Allowance</li>
  <li>Pre-Retirement Allowance (PRETA)</li>
  <li>Farm Assist (FA)</li>

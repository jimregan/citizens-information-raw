<p>The social welfare system in Ireland is divided into three main types of
payments. These are: </p>
<ul><li>Social insurance payments: (for example, <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker's
    Benefit</a>) </li>
  <li>Means-tested payments or social assistance payments: (for example, <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
    Allowance</a>) </li>
  <li>Universal payments: (for example, <a shape="rect" href="../../payments_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child
    Benefit</a>) </li>
</ul><p>With all social welfare payments in Ireland, you must satisfy the rules for
each scheme to qualify. You must also be <em>habitually resident</em> in
Ireland to qualify for the following payments:</p>

<p>Your <a href="../claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">spouse,
civil partner or cohabitant</a> and any <a href="../claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_and_increase_in_your_payment_for_a_child_dependant.html">dependent
children</a> you have are not required to satisfy the habitual residence
condition in their own right. So if you apply for a social welfare payment only
you, the applicant, have to satisfy the habitual residence condition. </p>

<p>The Department of Social Protection has published comprehensive <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Habitual-Residence-Condition--Guidelines-for-Deciding-Offic.aspx">Operational
Guidelines on the habitual residence condition</a>. It is sometimes referred to
as the HRC. </p>

<h3>Exemption from the habitual residence condition</h3>

<p>Under EU law, in certain circumstances, the habitual residence condition
does not have to be satisfied. These circumstances apply to:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Family Benefits</strong> and </li>
  <li><strong>Supplementary Welfare Allowance</strong></li>
</ol><p>The following Irish social welfare payments are classified as <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/part9.pdf">Family Benefits under EU
Regulations (pdf)</a>:</p>
<ul><li><a href="../../social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/back_to_work_family_dividend.html">Back
    to Work Family Dividend</a></li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child
    Benefit</a></li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/disability_and_illness/domiciliary_care_allowance.html">Domiciliary
    Care Allowance</a></li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/death_related_benefits/guardians_payments.html">Guardian's
    Payment (Non-Contributory) </a> </li>
  <li><a href="../../social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
    Income Supplement</a> (HRC does not apply to FIS) </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent
    Family Payment</a> </li>
</ul><p>This means that they are payable to a person who qualifies for EU migrant
worker status for dependants who are resident in Ireland or in another EEA
state. People who do not have to satisfy the habitual residence condition for
Family Benefits include:</p>
<ul><li>EEA/EU citizens who are currently employed or self-employed here (or who
    are getting Jobseeker's Benefit or any other benefit which derives from
    their employment such as Maternity Benefit, Illness Benefit or Occupational
    Injuries Benefit)</li>
  <li>Non-EEA nationals, who have previously worked in another EEA State, and
    are currently legally employed or self-employed here</li>
</ul><p>You can read more about <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Habitual-Residence-Condition--Guidelines-for-Deciding-Offic.aspx#sect3">Exemption
from the HRC for Family Benefits on welfare.ie</a>. People who move to Ireland
to look for employment are subject to the habitual residence condition in the
normal way while looking for work.</p>

<p>If you are an EEA national and can be considered an EU migrant worker, you
may be entitled to <a href="../../social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allowance_scheme.html">Supplementary
Welfare Allowance (SWA)</a>. To be considered an EU migrant worker you must
have been in genuine employment (not casual work) since coming to Ireland. This
means that people who have been employed since arriving in Ireland may be
entitled to SWA if they have involuntarily lost some or all of their work even
if they do not satisfy the habitual residence condition for Jobseeker's
Allowance. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Changes to HRC in 2014</h3>

<p>You must be habitually resident in the State on the date you make the
application and you must remain habitually resident in the State after you
apply. This provision was added by the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2014,
which came into force on 17 July 2014. Before this, the habitual residence
condition (HRC) could only be examined on the date of application.</p>

<p>Since 17 July 2014, the HRC decision on your case may be reviewed if any
relevant circumstances change (for example, if you lose the right to reside) or
if you were absent from the State for a significant period of time.</p>

<h3>What is habitual residence?</h3>

<p>The term "habitually resident" is not defined in Irish law. In practice it
means that you have a proven close link to Ireland. The term also conveys
permanence - that a person has been here for some time and intends to stay here
for the foreseeable future. Proving you are habitually resident relies heavily
on fact. If you have lived in Ireland all your life, you will probably have no
difficulty showing that you satisfy the factors which indicate habitual
residence – see list below.</p>

<p><strong>Who decides whether an applicant is habitually resident?</strong></p>

<p>Statutorily appointed Deciding Officers (or Determining Officers in the case
of Supplementary Welfare Allowance) determine whether you meet the requirement
to be habitually resident in the State.</p>

<p>The Officer will rely on the evidence you provide and be guided by national
and EU law and guidelines when making their decision. When the Officer makes a
decision on whether a person is habitually resident they must follow a series
of steps:</p>

<p><strong>1. Check whether you are a person who is not regarded as being
habitually resident in the State</strong></p>

<p>For example, asylum seekers are not regarded as habitually resident. You can
find out more about <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Habitual-Residence-Condition--Guidelines-for-Deciding-Offic.aspx#app3">who
is not regarded as habitually resident in Appendix 3 of the Operational
Guidelines</a>. </p>

<p><strong>2. Check whether you are exempt from the habitual residence
condition</strong></p>

<p>Certain people, in particular EEA nationals who are considered migrant
workers, are exempt from the habitual residence condition (see also
<strong>Exemption from the habitual residence condition</strong> above). You
can find out more about <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Habitual-Residence-Condition--Guidelines-for-Deciding-Offic.aspx#sect3">who
is exempt from the habitual residence condition in Section 3 of the Operational
Guidelines. </a></p>

<p><strong>3. Check whether a previous habitual residence decision has been
given or if the case is under appeal</strong></p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Habitual-Residence-Condition--Guidelines-for-Deciding-Offic.aspx#sect4">previous
decision on habitual residence</a> should carry through to subsequent claims
unless there has been a significant change in circumstances since a new
application was made.</p>

<p><strong>4. Consider whether the person has a right to reside in the
State</strong></p>

<p>If you do not have <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Habitual-Residence-Condition--Guidelines-for-Deciding-Offic.aspx#sect5">a
legal right of residence in this State</a>, you will not be regarded as
habitually resident. The following groups of people have a right to reside in
Ireland:</p>
<ul><li>Irish nationals</li>
  <li>UK nationals from the Common Travel Area (CTA)</li>
  <li>EEA nationals who are employed or self-employed in Ireland</li>
  <li>EEA nationals who have been employed here for over a year and are now
    unemployed, provided they are registered as jobseekers with the Department
    of Social Protection</li>
  <li>EEA nationals, who have been employed here for less than a year and are
    now unemployed, may stay for another 6 months provided they are registered
    as jobseekers with the Department of Social Protection</li>
  <li>EEA nationals who can support themselves, their spouse/civil partner and
    any accompanying dependents and who have comprehensive sickness
  insurance</li>
  <li>EEA nationals who are visitors or jobseekers can stay for up to 3 months
    provided that they do not become a burden on the social welfare system of
    the State during that period (as determined by the Department of Justice -
    <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/SI656of2006.pdf/Files/SI656of2006.pdf">SI
    656 of 2006 (pdf)</a>)</li>
  <li>Non-EEA nationals with an employment permit that allows them to legally
    reside and work in the State. A person with permission to reside will have
    the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Stamps">appropriate
    immigration stamp</a> in their passport and a Certificate of Registration
    issued by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) (a GNIB card). </li>
  <li>Asylum seekers who have been granted permission to remain</li>
</ul><p>The <em>resident spouse or civil partner and/or dependants</em> of a person
with refugee status or of a non-EEA national with an employment permit normally
hold the same habitual residence status as that of the sponsor. These family
members should be treated as habitually resident as long as they and the
sponsor retain permission to be in the State.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>5. Examine the 5 factors to determine habitual residence</strong></p>

<p>Once your right to reside has been established the following 5 factors
(which have been set down in Irish and European law) are examined to find out
if you are habitually resident in Ireland:</p>
<ul><li>Length and continuity of residence in Ireland</li>
  <li>Length and purpose of any absence from Ireland</li>
  <li>Nature and pattern of employment</li>
  <li>Your main centre of interest</li>
  <li>Your future intentions to live in Ireland as it appears from the
  evidence</li>
</ul><p>You can find out more <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Habitual-Residence-Condition--Guidelines-for-Deciding-Offic.aspx">about
the 5 factors in the Operational Guidelines</a> on the Department of Social
Protection's website. The Department of Social Protection has also published <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Habitual-Residence-Condition-HRC-Guidelines---Supplement.aspx">a
supplement to the Guidelines with scenarios which show how the habitual
residence condition is applied in practice</a>.</p>

<h3>Returning Irish emigrants</h3>

<p>EU rules prevent discrimination on nationality grounds in relation to social
security, so it is not possible to exempt a particular category of Irish
citizens (such as returning Irish emigrants) from the habitual residence
condition (either in general or for Carer’s Allowance) without extending the
same treatment to all EU nationals. However, the guidelines on determination of
habitual residence address the issue of returning emigrants very specifically.
The guidelines state: “A person who had previously been habitually resident
in the State and who moved to live and work in another country and then resumes
his/her long-term residence in the State may be regarded as being habitually
resident immediately on his/her return to the State.”</p>

<p>When determining the main centre of interest for returning emigrants,
Deciding Officers take account of:</p>
<ul><li>The purpose of your return, for example, because your foreign residence
    permit has expired</li>
  <li>Your stated intentions</li>
  <li>Verified arrangements which you have made in regard to returning on a
    long-term basis, for example, transfer of financial accounts and any other
    assets, termination of residence-based entitlements in the other country,
    or assistance from <a href="http://www.safehomeireland.com/">Safe-Home</a>
    or a similar programme to enable Irish emigrants to return permanently</li>
  <li>Length and continuity of your previous residence in the State</li>
  <li>Your record of employment or self employment in another state and</li>
  <li>Whether you have maintained links with your previous residence and can be
    regarded as resuming your previous residence rather than starting a new
    period of residence. </li>
</ul><h3><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>

<p>If the DSP needs more information to decide whether you are habitually
resident in the Republic of Ireland you may be asked to fill out the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/hrc1.pdf">HRC1 form (pdf)</a>. </p>

<p><strong></strong>Regardless of what country you are coming from you may be
asked to provide documentary evidence that shows your 'centre of interest' is
now in Ireland. This evidence should show that you have moved to Ireland, you
intend to settle in Ireland permanently and you do not intend to go back to
live in the country you came from.</p>

<p>Where possible, you should provide the following documentary evidence:</p>
<ul><li>Proof to show you have given up accommodation abroad</li>
  <li>Proof that you have cancelled or applied to cancel any non-transferable
    benefits</li>
  <li>Proof you have transferred or applied to transfer any transferable
  income</li>
  <li>Proof to show measures you have put in place to open a bank account
  here</li>
  <li>Proof to show you have a tenancy in your own name (in Ireland)</li>
  <li>Proof of travel documents including, where relevant, excess baggage fees
    and removal/shipping receipts</li>
</ul><p>All evidence presented will be authenticated, as far as is possible, by the
relevant Officer. In some cases you may be asked to submit further documentary
evidence. In certain cases, a Social Welfare Inspector may investigate your
application.</p>

<h3>Appealing a decision on habitual residency</h3>

<p>If you are not satisfied with the decision made in your case you have the
right of review and/or the right of appeal. If you wish to have your case
reviewed you can submit additional evidence and ask for the decision to be
reviewed. You can also bring an appeal against the decision to the independent
<a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_appeals.html">Social Welfare Appeals
Office</a>. If you prefer, you may appeal directly to the independent Social
Welfare Appeals Office without first asking for a review. </p>

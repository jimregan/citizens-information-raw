<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Social assistance payments are for people who do not have enough <a shape="rect" href="../social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">PRSI
contributions</a> to qualify for the equivalent social insurance payments. An
example would be a person who becomes unemployed, applies for Jobseeker's
Benefit but fails to qualify because he or she has insufficient PRSI
contributions. He or she can instead apply for Jobseeker's Allowance, which is
a similar payment but is not based on the number of PRSI contributions paid.
Jobseeker's Benefit is a social insurance payment but Jobseeker's Allowance is
a social assistance payment.</p>

<p>However, to get a social assistance payment you must be <a shape="rect" href="residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitually
resident in Ireland</a> and you must pass a <a shape="rect" href="../means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/means_test.html">means
test</a>. <br></p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The rules governing social welfare assistance payments are set out in
legislation and/or administrative guidelines. Most of the guidelines are now
available on the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie">Department of Social
Protection's (DSP) website</a>. </p>

<p>In general you cannot get two social assistance payments (except for <a href="../../social_welfare_payments/carers/half_rate_carers_allowance.html">Carer's
Allowance which can be paid at a half rate with another social welfare
payment</a>). If you think you might qualify for more than one payment, you
generally have to choose the one that is of most benefit to you. </p>

<p>There are a number of social assistance payments. You may qualify for one
depending on your circumstances:</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
Allowance</a> is paid to people aged 18 or over and unemployed.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../../payments_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent
Family Payment</a> (OFP) is paid to men and women who are bringing children up
without the support of a partner.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/farming_and_fishing/farm_assist.html">Farm Assist</a> is
an income support scheme for farmers. You do not need to be available for work
to qualify for Farm Assist.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/death_related_benefits/widows_non_contrib_pen.html">Widow's,
Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Non-Contributory) Pension</a> is paid

orphan's 18th birthday or 22nd birthday if he or she is in full-time
education.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/carers/carers_allowance.html">Carer's

<p>If you qualify for a social assistance payment you may qualify for <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/extra_social_welfare_benefits/">additional
social welfare benefits</a>.</p>

<p>For most social assistance payments, decisions about your entitlement are
made by Deciding Officers. Deciding Officers are DSP officials appointed under
the social welfare legislation. </p>

<p>If you are not happy with a decision by the Department of Social Protection,
you have a right to appeal decisions in relation to payments that are based in
legislation. Appeals are made to the Social Welfare Appeals Office, an
independent statutory body. <a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_appeals.html">Find out how to appeal a decision of the
Department of Social Protection</a>. </p>

<h3>Rates of payment and dependants</h3>

<p>Social welfare payments are divided into a payment for you, the claimant,
known as the <em>personal rate</em> of payment, and a payment for any <a shape="rect" href="../claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">adult
dependants</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_and_increase_in_your_payment_for_a_child_dependant.html">child

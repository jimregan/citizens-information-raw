<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>You can get certain Irish social welfare payments and live in another
country. You can also continue to get certain social welfare payments if you
are on holiday abroad for a specific period of time or if you are getting
medical treatment abroad.</p>

<p>Most <a href="../social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social
insurance payments</a> can be paid to you outside of this state, though the
duration can depend on the payment and your circumstances. However, to get a <a href="../social_assistance_payments/social_assistance_in_ireland.html">social
assistance payment</a> you must live in the State.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Holidays and social welfare payments</h3>

<p>In general you can take up to 2 weeks holidays each year and have your
social welfare payment paid. However you must always contact your local Intreo
Centre, Social Welfare Branch Office or your Department of Social Protection
representative (formerly known as the Community Welfare Officer) to check your
entitlements before planning or taking holidays. If you plan to take longer
holidays or to be abroad for an extended period your social welfare payment may
not be paid. </p>

<p>If you are getting <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
Allowance</a> or <a href="../../social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker's
Benefit</a> you can go on holiday for a maximum of 2 weeks and get the 2 weeks
payment on your return. You must notify your Intreo Centre or Social Welfare
Branch Office before taking your holiday. <a href="https://www.welfare.ie/EN/ContactUs/Pages/jajbHoliday.aspx">Some social
welfare offices allow you to apply for holidays online</a>. Both payments can
also be paid on your return from representing Ireland in an amateur capacity at
international sporting event. You must get written confirmation of the sport
and time involved from the governing sporting body. </p>

<p>If you are getting <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/unemployed_people/preta.html">Pre-Retirement Allowance</a>
you can go on holiday for a maximum of 2 weeks and cash your payment order on
your return. If you go on holiday for more than 2 weeks you must return your
payment book before you go on holiday abroad. When you return you will get your
payment book back but will only get a payment for 2 weeks of your holiday.</p>

<h3>Irish social welfare payments paid outside the State</h3>

<p>If you are living outside the Irish State, the following social welfare
payments can be paid abroad:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/disability_and_illness/invalidity_pension.html">Invalidity
    Pension</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html">State
    Pension (Contributory)</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/disability_and_illness/disablement_benefit.html">Disablement
    Benefit</a>. The Constant Attendance Allowance increase is only paid for up
    to 6 months. However, if you are abroad for medical treatment you may
    continue to get Incapacity Supplement, such claims are assessed on a case
    by case basis. </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/death_related_benefits/guardians_payments.html">Guardian's
    Payment (Contributory)</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/death_related_benefits/widows_contrib_pension.html">Widow's,
    Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../social_welfare_payments/death_related_benefits/dependent_parents_pension.html">Death
    Benefits under the Occupational Injury Benefit Scheme</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/death_related_benefits/standard_bereavement_grant.html">Bereavement
    Grant</a> </li>
</ul><p>If you are getting one of these social welfare payments and you are going
abroad for just a few weeks, you do <em>not </em>have to notify the Department
of Social Protection. </p>

<p>If you are going abroad for a long period of time or moving abroad
permanently you must notify the Department. You will be asked to produce
evidence to prove that you continue to fulfil the qualifying conditions for the
payment. For example, you must not be married or in a new civil partnership or
cohabitating with someone to continue to get a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving
Civil Partner's Contributory Pension.</p>

<p>To get your social welfare benefit paid to you abroad, you must contact the
section in the Department of Social Protection that pays your payment and give
your bank account details so that they can transfer your payment directly into
a bank account while you are abroad. Where payment is already made into your
bank account in the State, you can continue to have it paid as it is or change
it to a financial institution outside the country. </p>

<p>You must always notify the Department of a permanent or temporary absence
from the State and give your contact address abroad.</p>

<h3>Payments made abroad in limited situations</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/disability_and_illness/injury_benefit.html">Injury
Benefit</a> can be paid abroad if you are getting approved medical
treatment.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">Illness
Benefit</a> can be paid for a maximum of 4 weeks while you are on holiday in a
country covered by EU Regulations and 3 weeks in other countries. You can
continue to get Illness Benefit if you go to live in another country covered by
EU Regulations. However, you must still meet all the qualifying criteria for
Illness Benefit which includes submitting medical certificates to DSP. If you
go to live in another country covered by EU Regulations and become ill you may
apply for Illness Benefit from Ireland if you paid your last insurance
contribution in Ireland or you were getting Jobseeker’s Benefit in Ireland
before you went abroad. Illness Benefit is not paid in countries not covered by
EU Regulations. However, if you go to a country not covered by EU regulations
to get approved treatment your payment may resume when you return.</p>

<p>EU and non-EU citizens can travel abroad and get <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/maternity_benefit.html">Maternity
Benefit</a> or <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/adoptive_benefit.html">Adoptive
Benefit</a> for a maximum of 6 weeks while away.</p>

<p>If you are an EU citizen (or from Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein or
Switzerland) you can get Maternity Benefit or Adoptive Benefit for
<strong>any</strong> period of your maternity or adoptive leave spent in
another EU country (or in Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein or Switzerland).</p>

<p>To get Maternity Benefit or Adoptive Benefit paid while abroad, you must
notify the Department in advance of travel.</p>

<p>If you are working in another <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/european_government/european_union.html">EEA
member state</a> you may qualify for benefit, if you continue to be insured
under the Irish Social Welfare Acts. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/paternity_benefit.html">Paternity
Benefit</a> can be paid abroad to both EU and non-EU citizens for a maximum of
2 weeks. You must notify the Department in advance of travel.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker's
Benefit</a> (JB) may be transferred to another EEA member state for up to 13
weeks (78 days), if you are looking for work there. You must be getting
Jobseeker's Benefit for 4 weeks before you can transfer it to another EEA
member state (this requirement can be waived in some instances). From 1 May
2010 <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Policy/EU/Euguide/Documents/Part8.pdf">new EU
Regulations came into effect (pdf)</a> which mean that if you apply to transfer
your Jobseeker's Benefit, it will be paid directly to you. If an Increase for a
Qualified Adult (IQA) or Increases for Qualified Children (IQC) are being paid
you continue to be paid these in the normal way (whether your dependents travel
abroad with you or not). </p>

<p>You are still required to register with the employment services of the
country where you have gone to look for work within a week. If you are leaving
Ireland to move to Northern Ireland or Britain your Intreo Centre or Social
Welfare Branch Office will issue you with the Form U2 (formerly Form E303)
which you take to the UK social services. If you are moving to another EU
country the Department of Social Protection will send the U2 form to your new
address in that EU country. You may transfer your JB payment more than once
while you are unemployed provided you do not exceed the maximum period of 13
weeks.</p>

<p>If you are claiming JB you can claim increases for your qualified adult and
children who are living in another EEA member state.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/carers/carers_benefit.html">Carer's
Benefit</a> can be paid if you accompany the person you are caring for abroad
to get medical treatment. You can also go abroad on a respite break for a
maximum of 3 weeks. Carer's Benefit may be paid to a carer resident in any
country within the EU who is providing full-time care and attention to another
person in that country, provided the qualifying conditions have been met in

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>All income in Ireland is generally subject to taxation. Your social welfare
payment may or may not be deemed taxable but even if your social welfare
payment is taxable, you may not actually have to pay tax on it. If you are
getting a social welfare payment you get a <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/employment_tax_credits_and_reliefs.html">PAYE
tax credit</a> in addition to your normal tax credits. This means, if a social
welfare payment is your only source of income you may not pay tax because your
tax liability does not exceed your tax credits. The PAYE tax credit is given to
the person claiming the social welfare payment and not to the <a shape="rect" href="claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">adult
dependant</a> even if the Increase for a Qualified Adult is paid directly to
the dependant. </p>

<p><a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">Universal
Social Charge</a> and social insurance <a href="../social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">(PRSI)</a>
is not payable on social welfare payments. (PRSI is payable on some employment
schemes such as Community Employment.)</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l7096a">Social welfare payment and another
income</h2>

<p>If you have a social welfare payment and another source of income, you may
have to pay tax. In this case, your taxable social welfare payment and your
other income are added together. You are taxed on the total amount. There is no
mechanism for taxing social welfare payments at source (before it is paid to
you). Your non-social welfare income determines how tax due is paid. Illness
and Injury Benefit are generally taxed by your employer and other social
welfare payments are taxed by reducing your tax credits and rate band. </p>

<p>For example, you are getting a social welfare pension and an occupational
pension. Your occupational pension is taxed through the Pay-As-You-Earn (<a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/starting_work_and_changing_job/starting_work/tax_and_starting_work.html">PAYE</a>)
system in the same way as a wage or salary. This means that you get your tax
credits in the normal way. In order to tax your social welfare pension, your
annual tax credits are reduced by the tax liability on your social welfare
pension. You then effectively pay tax on both the pensions, but it is collected
from the occupational pension. For higher incomes, the standard rate cut off
point will also be reduced. The technical term for this is <em>coding in</em>
of credits. The same arrangement applies if you have income from a job and a
social welfare payment. If your social welfare payment was not coded in, you
would have to pay tax as a self-employed person and in a lump sum by 31 October
each year.</p>

<p>If your other source of income is not taxed through the PAYE system, for
example, if you are self-employed, have an <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/occupational_pensions.html">occupational
pension</a> from abroad or have investment income, then you are classed as a
self-employed person and your tax is payable annually by 31 October each
year.</p>

<h3>Social security pensions from abroad</h3>

<p>If you have a social security pension from abroad, it is also generally
taxable in Ireland. The tax is payable annually unless you have a source of
income that is subject to PAYE. Certain foreign pensions that would be exempt
from tax if you were resident in the country paying the pension, are however
also exempt from tax in Ireland. </p>

<h2>Taxation of specific social welfare payments</h2>

<p><a href="../../social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/maternity_benefit.html">Maternity
Benefit</a>, <a href="../../social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/paternity_benefit.html">Paternity
Benefit</a>, <a href="../../social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/adoptive_benefit.html">Adoptive
Benefit</a> and <a href="../../social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/health_safety_benefit.html">Health
and Safety Benefit</a> are taxable. Universal Social Charge and PRSI are not
payable. The actual rate of tax you will pay will depend on your personal
circumstances and the tax reliefs and tax credits you are claiming. The
information given here applies in exactly the same way to Adoptive, Paternity
and Health and Safety Benefit.</p>

<p>The Department of Social Protection (DSP) will pay Maternity Benefit without
any deduction of tax. However the DSP will notify Revenue of the amount of
Maternity Benefit to be taken into account for income tax purposes.</p>

<p>If you are self-employed and pay your tax through the self-assessment system
you should include details of any Maternity Benefit received in your annual tax
return.</p>

<p>If you pay tax through the PAYE system Revenue will, where possible,
automatically reduce your annual tax credits and rate bands to account for the
tax payable on your Maternity Benefit (see 'Further information' below for
examples). </p>

<p>You can read <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/personal/faqs/taxation-welfare-benefits.html#section4">more
detailed information and examples of how Maternity Benefit is taxed</a> on
Revenue's website. You can also read <a href="../../../reference/case_studies/case_study_taxation_of_maternity_benefit.html">our
case study</a>.</p>

<h4><strong>Maternity Benefit before 1 July 2013</strong></h4>

<p>If you were getting Maternity Benefit up to and including 30 June 2013 you
may be entitled to a tax and PRSI refund if your Maternity Benefit is paid to
your employer and your employer continues to pay your normal weekly wage. If
this is the case, when your Maternity Benefit has finished, you can write to
the Maternity Benefit Section or <a shape="rect" href="https://www.welfare.ie/EN/Secure/Pages/MaternityBenefitEnquiry.aspx">contact
the Maternity Benefit Section online</a> to request an MB21 Statement, which
you should then forward to <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/contact/index.html">your tax office</a> to get a
tax refund. To get a PRSI refund, you should complete the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Forms/Documents/prsiref1.pdf">Refund of PRSI
Contributions Application Form</a> and send it to the PRSI Refunds Section.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Illness Benefit and Injury Benefit</h3>

<p>If you are absent from work due to illness and you get (or your employer
gets on your behalf) <a href="../../social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">Illness
Benefit</a> or <a href="../../social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/injury_benefit.html">Injury
Benefit</a>, tax is collected through the PAYE system. No PRSI or USC is
payable. Employers must make changes to their PAYE procedures to account for
the Illness or Injury Benefit paid (Increases for Qualified Children are not
taxable). They do this by including the taxable amount of Illness or Injury
Benefit with the employee’s earnings. The Department of Social Protection
notifies employers of the amount of taxable Illness or Injury Benefit an
employee is entitled to and the date the payment started.</p>

<h3>Jobseeker’s Benefit and One-Parent Family Payment</h3>

<p>If you work and get <a href="../../social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker’s
Benefit (JB)</a> the taxable part of your JB is collected by adjusting your tax
credits and standard rate cut off point to account for the tax payable.
One-Parent Family Payment is taxed in the same way. No PRSI or USC is
payable.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l450a3">What social welfare payments are
taxable?</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it24.html">Jobseeker's
Benefit is generally taxable</a>, but the first €13 each week is exempt from
tax. Jobseeker's Benefit payable to short-time workers is not taxable. </p>

<p>Increases for Qualified Children payable with Jobseeker's Benefit, Illness
Benefit and the Occupational Injuries Scheme (Injury Benefit, Disablement
Pension and Incapacity Supplement) are not taxable.</p>

<p>Other than the cases above, if your social welfare payment is taxable, any
increase in your payment for your adult dependant and child dependants is also
taxable. </p>

<p>Guardian's payments, which are payments made for the benefit of an orphan,
are taxable. However a guardian's payment is regarded as the beneficial
property of the child and is therefore assessable against <em>their</em> income
(if any), <em>not</em> against the income of the person getting the guardian's
payment. </p>

<h3>Examples of how Maternity Benefit is taxed</h3>

<p>If you pay tax through the PAYE system you will probably fall into one of
the following 3 categories:</p>

<p><strong>1. You are paid your full or partial salary by your employer and
your Maternity Benefit is paid directly to them</strong></p>

<p>Revenue will reduce your tax credits and rate band to account for the tax
payable on your Maternity Benefit and in this way collect the tax due. Revenue
will then send a revised tax credit certificate to your employer. Your employer
should only deduct tax, USC and PRSI on the difference between the salary paid
and Maternity Benefit.</p>

<p><strong>2. You are paid your full or partial salary by your employer and
your Maternity Benefit is paid directly to you.</strong></p>

<p>Revenue will reduce your tax credits and rate band to account for the tax
payable on your Maternity Benefit and your employer should only deduct tax, USC
and PRSI only on the amount of salary actually paid by them.</p>

<p><strong>3. You do not get any salary while on maternity leave and your
Maternity Benefit is paid directly to you</strong></p>

<p>Revenue will reduce your tax credits and rate band to account for the tax
payable on your Maternity Benefit. They will then send a revised tax credit
certificate to your employer. If your only income is Maternity Benefit you will
probably pay very little or no tax (since your total tax credits will probably
exceed your total tax liability).</p>

<p>If you are not entitled to any pay on the usual pay day, you may contact
your employer to request repayment of any tax that might be due. Alternatively,
when you go back to work after maternity leave, any refund of tax which may be
due can be calculated.</p>

<p>The Department of Social Protection has a range of social welfare payments
that provide financial support. To get a social welfare payment, you must
apply. So, if you think you are entitled to a payment you should apply unless
you are certain you don't qualify.</p>

<p>Your first step before applying, is to find out which payment you may be
entitled to. Payments are available for <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/unemployed_people/">unemployed people</a>, for <a shape="rect" href="../../payments_payments_to_families_and_children/">families
and children</a>, for <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/death_related_benefits/">widows, widowers and surviving
civil partners</a>, for <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/death_related_benefits/">guardians or orphans</a>, for <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/older_and_retired_people/">older and retired
people</a> and for <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/disability_and_illness/">disabled people</a> and their <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/carers/">carers</a>. If you get a social
welfare payment you may also qualify for <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/extra_social_welfare_benefits/">extra social welfare

regular small amounts directly deducted from their social welfare payment to
pay household bills. For example, telephone, gas, electricity and local
authority rent. <br></p>

<p>To apply for a social welfare payment you must fill in an application form
and provide other supporting documentation. The information and documentation
varies from one payment to another. The type of documentation required will
also depend on your personal circumstances. However, you must normally submit
some documentation with your claim form. </p>

<p>If you apply for, or are currently getting a social welfare payment
(including Child Benefit) you may be asked to register for a <a href="../public_services_card.html">Public Services Card</a>. </p>

<p></p>

<p>If you qualify for a payment, you may be able to get an increase in your
payment for an <a shape="rect" href="claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">adult
dependant</a>. You may be able to claim for a <a shape="rect" href="claiming_and_increase_in_your_payment_for_a_child_dependant.html">child
dependant.</a> If it is possible to claim for dependants, the Department of
Social Protection will request information about your dependants on the
application form. </p>

<p>It may take some time for the Department to process your claim. As part of
the procedure, you may be interviewed in your home or asked to attend an
interview at your local social welfare office.</p>

<p>While your claim is being processed by the Department, you may qualify for
<a shape="rect" href="../../payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary
Welfare Allowance</a>. </p>

<p>It is important that you make your claim as soon as you know you are
entitled to the payment. All payments must be claimed within a specific period
of time. If you don't claim on time you may lose out. Find out more about <a shape="rect" href="making_a_late_claim.html">making a late claim</a>. </p>

<p>If you are asked to provide information reasonably required by a social
welfare inspector when investigating your claim you must provide the
statements, information or documents within 21 days. The same time period
applies to your spouse, civil partner, cohabitant, employer and certain other
people (for example, landlords).</p>

<p>If you are refused a social welfare payment or get a lesser amount than you
expected, you have 21 days to <a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_appeals.html">appeal the decision of the Department of
Social Protection</a>. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You must complete the application form and provide supporting documentation.
You can get an application or claim form, from the Department of Social
Protection, your <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/ContactUs/Pages/localoffice.aspx">Intreo Centre
or Social Welfare Branch Office</a> or your <a href="http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/">local Citizens Information
Centre</a>. You can also <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Pages/azindex.aspx?tab=forms">get an application
form from the Department's website</a>. <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/onlineservices_home.aspx">You can also
apply for some services online. </a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/onlineservices_home.aspx"></a></p>

<p>Your Intreo Centre, Social Welfare Branch Office or your local Citizens
Information Centre can help you fill in your claim form.</p>

<p>If you need a birth, marriage or death certificate for any social welfare
payment you can buy it at a reduced rate (currently â‚¬1) from your nearest
Superintendent Registrars Office or the General Registrar Office (GRO). To get
the reduced rate you need a letter or note from the Department to prove that
the certificate is needed for those purposes. The Department of Social
Protection will keep any certificates you get for a reduced fee.</p>

<p>The General Registers Office keeps all records relating to births, deaths
and marriages in Ireland (not Northern Ireland). Birth certificates of adopted
children and non-Catholic marriage certificates are only available from the
General Register Office. The Superintendent Registrars are located in each
county and hold records of all births, deaths and marriages that took place in
those counties. You can get more information about getting a <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/registrar_birth_marr_death.html">Birth,
Marriage or Death certificate</a>.<br></p>

<h3>How social welfare decisions are made</h3>

<h1><br></h1>

<p>Deciding Officers are employed by the Department of Social Protection to
accept or reject claims made in Ireland for social welfare payments. Deciding
officers are given the power to make these decisions through the Social Welfare
Consolidation Act 2005 as amended and other social welfare legislation. </p>

<p>Before making a claim or applying for a social welfare payment you must
complete the application form. The application form will ask for various
details, such as your name, address, PPS number, income etc. These details will
help the Department of Social Protection to process your application and if
your claim is successful to put it into payment. </p>

<p>As part of the application process, you must also provide supporting
documentation to prove that the information you have given on the application
form is correct. For example, a birth certificate to prove you have given the
correct date of birth.</p>

<p>To qualify for a social welfare payment you must meet all the qualifying
criteria for that payment. Different social welfare payments have different
qualifying criteria. It is your responsibility to prove to the Department that
you qualify for the payment you have applied for. </p>

<p>If you are applying for a payment due to an illness or disability your
doctor must fill in part of the application from. If you are in work, your
employer may have to fill in a part of the form. The type of information
required depends on the payment you apply for.</p>

<p>When you send your application form into the Department of Social Protection
it will be assessed to make sure that it is correctly completed and that you
have sent all the required documentation with your application form.</p>

<p>At this point, the Department may request further information from you or
ask you to attend a medical examination to find out if you qualify for the
payment you applied for. For example if you apply for Disability Allowance you
may be asked to attend for a medical examination. If this is the case, the
doctor's report stating whether or not you meet the medical criteria is sent to
the person at the Department of Social Protection who is responsible for making
a decision on your claim.</p>

<p>When the Department has all the information it needs, a Deciding Officer
will examine your claim and will either accept or reject your claim for the
social welfare payment you applied for. The Deciding Officer must apply the law
as laid out in Social Welfare Acts, Statutory Instruments, and relevant
Department guidelines, circulars etc. when making a decision on your claim. If
your claim is approved, the Deciding Officer will determine the rate of your
payment. </p>

<p>A Deciding Officer must record his or her decision on your claim in writing.
Generally, if your application for a payment has been successful you will get a
letter stating this. If the decision is unfavorable however, the deciding
officer must give you a letter stating you claim has been rejected and also the
reasons for this decision in writing. If you have been awarded less than the
maximum rate of payment you must get a letter stating the reasons for this.</p>

<p>It is useful to know the reason or reasons why a deciding officer rejected
your claim or awarded you less than the maximum rate of payment, especially if
you wish to challenge his or her decision. </p>

<p>If you disagree with the decision a Deciding Officer made in relation to
your claim you can:</p>
<ul><li>Contact the Deciding Officer who is dealing with your claim with any
    further evidence or information to support your claim and request the
    Deciding officer to review your claim. In this case the Deciding officer
    can review your claim. If you are not happy with the outcome of a reviewed
    decision by a deciding officer, you can appeal the reviewed decision to the
    Social Welfare Appeals Office. </li>
</ul><p><strong>Or</strong></p>
<ul><li>Appeal the decision of the deciding Officer directly to the Social
    Welfare Appeals Office. </li>
</ul><p><a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_appeals.html">Further information

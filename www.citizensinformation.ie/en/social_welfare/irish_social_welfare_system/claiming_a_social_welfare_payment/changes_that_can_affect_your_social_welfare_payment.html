<p>If you are getting a social welfare payment and your personal circumstances
change you <strong>must</strong> contact the Department of Social Protection. A
change in your circumstances can mean you get an increase or a decrease in your
social welfare payment. You could even be entitled to an extra or different
social welfare payment. </p>

<p>Contacting the Department will mean you get your increase faster or avoid
repaying overpayments.</p>

<p>A change in your personal circumstances may mean you qualify for a social
welfare payment for the first time. For example, if you were working and
recently lost your job, you may be entitled to <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker's
Benefit</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
Allowance</a>. If you are in private rented accommodation you may also qualify
for <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a>. <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/losing_your_job/">Read more about
losing your job</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes, there can be a change in your personal circumstances but you
don't qualify for a social welfare payment. In this case, you may qualify for
Supplementary Welfare Allowance. For example, if your employer does not pay you
when you are out of work sick, but you don't qualify for Illness Benefit, you
may qualify for <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary
Welfare Allowance</a>. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Changes meaning you qualify for additional social welfare payments</h3>

<p>A change in your personal circumstances may mean you qualify for an
additional social welfare payment. For example, if you are getting a One-Parent
Family Payment and get a job for at least 19 hours a week, you may be able to
claim <a href="../../social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
Income Supplement (FIS)</a>. </p>

<h3>Changes meaning you qualify for a different social welfare payment</h3>

<p>A change in your circumstances may mean you no longer qualify for the
payment you are currently getting but qualify for a different payment. In some
cases, you may be financially better off on the different payment. For example,
Domiciliary Care Allowance is no longer paid when the person being cared for
reaches 16 years of age. However, the person with the disability can apply for
<a shape="rect" href="../../payments/disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability
Allowance</a>, which is paid at a higher rate than <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/disability_and_illness/domiciliary_care_allowance.html">Domiciliary
Care Allowance</a>. </p>

<h3>Changes meaning you qualify for extra payments</h3>

<p>Some extra payments, such as the <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/extra_social_welfare_benefits/fuel_allowance.html">Fuel
Allowance</a>, the <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/extra_social_welfare_benefits/living_alone_allowance.html">Living
Alone Allowance</a> or the <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/extra_social_welfare_benefits/household_benefits_package.html">Household
Benefits Package</a> as it applies to people under age 70, require you to
either live alone or with certain qualified people. If you do not qualify
because of this rule and your circumstances change, you should contact the
Department of Social Protection.</p>

<p>You may also lose the payment if an 'unqualified' person comes to live with
you.</p>

<h3>Changes meaning you qualify for a reduced social welfare payment</h3>

<p>If you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant take up employment or get
income or capital from any other source, it may reduce your payment.</p>

<p>If you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant save a portion of your
State Pension (Non-Contributory) each week, these savings will be taken into
account as means. It is important to notify the Department of Social Protection
of these savings to avoid <a href="recovery_of_social_welfare_overpayments.html">an overpayment</a>.</p>

<h3>Changes meaning you no longer qualify for a social welfare payment</h3>

<p>A change in your circumstances may mean you no longer qualify for a social
welfare payment. For example, you are not entitled to Widow's, Widower's or
Surviving Civil Partner's Pension if you remarry or enter into a new civil
partnership or cohabit with someone else.</p>

<p>It is a criminal offence to claim a social welfare payment, if you know you
are not entitled to it. You <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/OperationalGuidelines/Pages/prosec.aspx">can be
prosecuted for claiming a social welfare payment that you are no longer
entitled to</a>. </p>

<h3>Changes automatically made to your social welfare payment</h3>

<p>In some cases, the Department of Social Protection will automatically change
your social welfare payment to reflect changes in your personal circumstances.
For example, if you are getting a social welfare payment, you will
automatically get an increase in your payment when you are 80 years of age.
However, in most cases you must contact the Department of Social Protection
when your circumstances change.<br></p>

<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l23f7d">Further information</h2>

<p>In some cases, if you qualify for more than one payment you will have to
choose the one that is of most benefit to you. For example, though you may
qualify for Illness Benefit it may be of greater benefit for you to claim
Disability Allowance because of the additional benefits, such as Fuel
Allowance, the Living Alone Increase and the Household Benefits Package. You
can get help and advice on which social welfare payment you qualify for and
which is of most benefit to you from your <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/List-of-Social-Welfare-Local-and-Branch-Offices-by-County.aspx">Intreo
centre or social welfare local office</a> and your <a href="http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/">local Citizens Information
Service</a>.</p>

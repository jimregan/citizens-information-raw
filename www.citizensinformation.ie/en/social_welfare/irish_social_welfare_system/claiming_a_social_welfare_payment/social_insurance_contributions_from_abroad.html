<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Ireland has social security arrangements with other countries that allow you
to combine social insurance contributions that you have paid in Ireland with
social insurance contributions that you have paid in another country. This can
help you to qualify for a <a shape="rect" href="../social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social
insurance payment</a> in Ireland or in a country with whom Ireland has a social
security arrangement.</p>

<p>Social security arrangements that Ireland has with other countries can be
divided broadly into two groups:</p>
<ul><li>Countries covered by European Union (EU) regulations </li>
  <li>Countries with whom Ireland has Bilateral Social Security Agreements </li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Countries covered by EU regulations</h3>

<p>Social security provisions have existed in EU law for more than 30 years.
They are contained in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Press/PressReleases/2010/Pages/pr040510.aspx">Regulation
(EC) No 883/2004 and 987/2009.</a></p>

<p>The EU/EEA countries covered by these Regulations are: Austria, Belgium,
Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg,
Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Norway, Portugal, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom (including
the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man - see 'Bilateral social security
agreements' below).</p>

<p>EU regulations relating to social security generally apply to the following
people:</p>
<ul><li>Nationals of the countries covered by the regulations. </li>
  <li>People with the status of stateless people or refugees who are living
    permanently in any of the countries covered by the regulations and their
    dependants or survivors </li>
</ul><p>If you have worked in Ireland and one or more EU state your social insurance
contributions from each EU state will be added to your Irish social insurance
contributions to help you qualify for one of the social welfare payments listed
below. In the case of some payments (for example, Jobseeker's Benefit, Illness
Benefit and Maternity Benefit) your last social insurance contribution must be
paid in Ireland.</p>

  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/carers/carers_benefit.html">Carer's
    Benefit</a></li>
</ul><h3>Countries with whom Ireland has Bilateral Social Security Agreements</h3>

<p>Bilateral Social Security Agreements are specific arrangements between
participating countries that allow people to move between countries and protect
their pension entitlements. Ireland has Bilateral Social Security Agreements
with:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/sw84.aspx">Canada</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/sw96.aspx">Quebec</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Irish_Australian-Social-Security-Agreement---SW-87.aspx">Australia</a>
  </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/sw91.aspx">United
    States of America</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/sw95.aspx">New
    Zealand</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/sw125.aspx">Republic
    of Korea</a> </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/sw129.aspx">Japan</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/sw123.aspx">UK (covering Channel
    Islands and the Isle of Man)</a></li>
</ul><p>Ireland's <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Irish_Swiss-Social-Security-Agreement---SW-97.aspx">Bilateral
Social Security Agreement with <strong>Switzerland</strong></a> has been mainly
replaced by EU regulations. </p>

<p>The benefits covered by bilateral social security agreements are: </p>
<ul><li>State Pension (Contributory) </li>
  <li>Widows, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension
  </li>
  <li>Guardian's Payment (Contributory) </li>
  <li>Invalidity Pension </li>
</ul><p>The bilateral social security agreements are of greatest relevance for
pensioners who retire to Ireland after working in one of the countries listed
above.</p>

<p>If you have come from a country with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social
Security Agreement, your pension rights from the other country are protected
when you move to Ireland. It is possible to have a pension from Ireland and one
or all of the other countries. You may be able to combine your insurance
records from Ireland and the other country to qualify for a <a href="../../social_welfare_payments/older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html">State
Pension (Contributory)</a>.<br></p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l7320b">How to apply </h2>

<p>When you are filling in or completing an application for an Irish social
insurance payment, there is a section on the application form that will ask you
whether you have ever been employed in an EU country other than Ireland. In the
case of long-term payments you will be asked if you have ever been employed in
an EU country or a country with whom Ireland has a bi-lateral social security
agreement. </p>

<p>You will be asked for the following information: </p>
<ul><li>The country where you worked </li>
  <li>The name and address of your employer there </li>
  <li>The dates you worked there </li>
  <li>Your Social Security Number there </li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="lfade9">Where to apply </h2>

<p>To claim a social welfare payment you should fill out the correct
application form and return it to the Department of Social Protection. The
return address is printed on the application form.</p>

<h2>How your social insurance contributions from other states are
calculated</h2>

<p>If you have worked in another EU state or a country with which Ireland has a
bi-lateral social security agreement, the social insurance contributions you
have paid there may help you to qualify for an Irish social insurance payment.
</p>

<h2>EU Regulations</h2>

<p>Under EU regulations, specifically <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Policy/EU/Euguide/Documents/883_2004.pdf">Regulation
EEC No. 883/2004 (pdf)</a> (was 1408/71), entitlements built up in one EU
member state should be recognised when calculating benefit entitlement in
another.</p>

<p>You should get forms U1 (formerly E301) and E104 when you leave an EU
country where you have worked. These forms are available at the relevant social
security agency in the country you are coming from and provide details of your
social insurance record. Form E104 is needed if you apply for sickness benefits
and form U1 is required for unemployment benefits.</p>

<p>For example, if you are applying for Illness Benefit, send a copy of your
E104 with your application for Illness Benefit. It will speed up the processing
of your application. If you don’t have form E104 from the relevant EU
countries you have worked in, once you state the other countries you have
worked in on your application form the Department of Social Protection will
obtain the relevant details for you.</p>

<p>Before coming to Ireland, you should check with the local social security
office in the country you are working in about the appropriate documentation to
bring with you.</p>

<h2>Bi-lateral Social Security Agreements</h2>

<p>Contributions paid in states with which Ireland has a bi-lateral social
security agreement will only cover you for certain long-term payments, such as,
the State Pension (Contributory), Invalidity Pension, Widow’s, Widower’s or
Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension, andGuardian’s Payment
(Contributory).</p>

<p>You must have been in insurable employment for at least one week in Ireland
for a bilateral agreement to apply and (except in the case of Guardian’s
Payment (Contributory)) have a minimum of 52 reckonable weeks under Irish
legislation. If you apply for one of the above social insurance payments in
Ireland and put in your application that you have worked in a country with
which Ireland has a bi-lateral social security agreement the Department of
Social Protection will do the following:</p>
<ul><li>If you have enough Irish social insurance contributions to get an Irish
    payment the Department will pay it and also initiate, on your behalf, a
    claim in the other country you worked in </li>
  <li>If you do not have enough social insurance contributions the Department
    will request your social insurance record from the other country to help
    you qualify for an Irish social insurance payment and also initiate, on
    your behalf, a claim in the other country that you have worked </li>
</ul><p>This means you can get more than one payment; you can get an Irish payment
and a payment from another country. The rate of pension or payment, where
insurance contributions in another country are being combined with Irish
contributions, is calculated as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br>
Your notional pension is calculated. Notional pension is the rate of Irish
pension which would be payable if all your social insurance contributions, both
Irish and non-Irish, were treated as Irish contributions. To get the yearly
average number of contributions, your Irish and non-Irish reckonable
contributions are added together and the total is then divided by the number of
years (this is, the number of years from your first paid social insurance
contribution to the end of the tax year before reaching pension age (66)).</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:<br></strong>The following formula is then applied:<br>
(A x B)/C<br>
A = the notional rate of pension. (See <strong>step 1</strong> to calculate the
notional rate of pension.)<br>
B = the number of Irish contributions.<br>
C = the total number of contributions (Irish + foreign)</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>
In the agreements with Austria, Australia, Canada, Quebec and UK, (as under EU
legislation), where there are less than 52 contributions paid in the other
country and a pension is not awarded by that country, the Irish pension is
awarded on the sum of the two insurance records without the application of the
pro-rata rule. </p>

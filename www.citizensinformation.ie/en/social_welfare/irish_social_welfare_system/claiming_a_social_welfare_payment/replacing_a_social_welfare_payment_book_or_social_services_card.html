<p>If you live in Ireland and are getting a social welfare payment, you can
request the method by which you are paid. Decisions on the choice of payment
method are administrative within the Department of Social Protection (DSP).</p>

<p>There are 4 different methods of payment: </p>
<ul><li><strong>By Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT): </strong>your social welfare
    payment is paid directly into your personal account at a bank, building
    society or at certain credit unions. You can use <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/eft.pdf">form DIR PMT1</a> to apply for
    EFT payment. DSP will decide if you can be paid by EFT. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong><strong></strong>By Electronic Information Transfer (EIT):
    </strong>your social welfare payment is sent directly to your local post
    office where it must be collected in person. You will need a <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/public_services_card.html">Public
    Services Card</a> or Social Services Card (SSC) for identification (ID) to
    collect your payment. If using an SSC, you will also require photo ID. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong><strong></strong>By cash in your local post office: </strong>you
    will need a Public Services Card or Social Services Card for identification
    to collect cash payments at your local post office. If using an SSC, you
    will also require photo ID. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>By cheque:</strong> your social welfare payment cheque can be
    cashed in your local post office or lodged to an account in a financial
    institution. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ul><p>Social welfare payments are no longer paid using a book of <em>payable
orders</em> that you can cash at your local post office. </p>

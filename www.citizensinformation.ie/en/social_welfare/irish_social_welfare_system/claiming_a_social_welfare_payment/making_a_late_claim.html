<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>To get a social welfare payment, you must make a claim for that payment to
the Department of Social Protection. You normally make a claim by completing an
application or claim form. There are generally <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Claims-and-Late-Claims.aspx">time limits
within which you must make your claim</a>. </p>

<p>The time limits for making a claim vary from one payment to another. The
time limits are generally quite short for short-term payments and are longer
for long-term pensions. For example, in the case of Jobseeker's Benefit you
must claim on the day that you become eligible and in the case of State Pension
(Contributory) you can claim up to 3 months before and 3 months after you reach
the age of 66. </p>

<p>You should claim a payment as soon as you think you might be entitled to it.
If you make a late claim you may get a payment from the date you <strong>sent
your claim</strong> to the department but you may not get your payment
back-dated to the <strong>time you were entitled to it but did not
claim</strong>.<br></p>

<h3>Extending the time limits<br></h3>

<p>In most cases the time limit for making a claim may be extended. This means
you can get your payment back-dated to the time that you became entitled to it
or for least six months before you made your claim, whichever is the lower. </p>

<p>To get the time limit extended you must have a <em>good reason</em> for not
making your claim within the time limit. There is little information about what
is a good reason but if you were sick or in hospital this might well be
considered as a good reason for not making your claim on time. Generally, the
fact that you did not know that you were entitled to a payment is not
considered to be a good reason for not making your claim on time. </p>

<p>The following social welfare schemes can be backdated if you have a good
reason for your late claim:</p>

date of your claim, whichever is the lower, without having to show a good
reason for the delay in making your claim.</p>

<p><strong>From April 2012</strong>, backdating is limited to 6 months for
<strong>State Pension (Contributory and Transition), Widow’s, Widower’s, or
Surviving Civil Partner’s (Contributory) Pension and Guardian’s Payment
(Contributory).</strong></p>

<p>Further backdating will be allowed only if:</p>
<ul><li>The failure to claim resulted from incorrect information being supplied
    by the Department of Social Protection <em>or</em></li>
  <li>The delay was due to your incapacity</li>
</ul><p>Decisions about entitlement to social welfare payments are made by officers,
appointed by the Minister, called deciding officers. </p>

<p>The Household Benefits Package can be <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Household-Benefits-Package.aspx#appendices">backdated
in some instances.</a></p>

evidence with your claim form. You can get assistance with this from your <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/ContactUs/Pages/localoffice.aspx">Intreo Centre

<p>It is generally only possible to claim one personal social assistance or
social insurance payment at a time in Ireland. However, in some circumstances,
you can keep your personal payment and get half of another social welfare
payment. </p>

<p>If you are getting certain social welfare payments and you are providing
full-time care and attention to another person, you can keep your main social
welfare payment and get half-rate Carer’s Allowance as well. More information
can be found in our document about <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/carers/half_rate_carers_allowance.html">qualifying for
half-rate Carer's Allowance</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../../social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/blind_persons_pension.html">Blind
Pension</a> can be paid with certain other social welfare payments provided you
meet the conditions for both payments. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<p>You can get a half-rate Maternity, Paternity, Adoptive or Health and Safety
Benefit payment if you are claiming one of the following social welfare
payments:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent
    Family Payment</a></li>

    Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/death_related_benefits/widows_non_contrib_pen.html">Widow's,

</ul><p>In addition, you must satisfy the social insurance contribution and other
conditions for <a shape="rect" href="../../payments_payments_to_families_and_children/maternity_benefit.html">Maternity
Benefit</a>, <a href="../../social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/paternity_benefit.html">Paternity

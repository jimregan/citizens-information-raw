<p>Overpayments may occur if an extra payment of an allowance, pension,
assistance or any other benefit is made to you by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie">Department of Social Protection</a>.</p>

<p>If you have been overpaid, the Department will inform you of:</p>
<ul><li>The reason(s) for the overpayment </li>
  <li>The amount involved </li>
</ul><p>And</p>
<ul><li>The way the Department proposes to recover the amount that has been
    overpaid. </li>
</ul><p>The liability to repay overpayments may continue to exist after your death.
Your personal representatives may be asked to repay the amounts owed from your
estate.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Changes in 2013</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/S.I.-25-of-2013.aspx">Social
Welfare Act 2012</a> changed the procedure for repayments of overpayments.
Since 28 January 2013 15% of your personal weekly rate of payment can be
deducted to recover an overpayment. Before that date you had to give your
written consent for any deduction that brought your payment below the weekly
rate of Supplementary Welfare Allowance for your family circumstances.</p>

<p>From 30 September 2013 deductions of up to 15% can be made from your
earnings (<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2013/en.act.2013.0020.pdf">under
section 15 of the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act
2013 (pdf)</a>). An overpayment can also be taken from money that you hold in a
bank or other financial institution. It is also possible that you may not be
able to withdraw money from a bank account (for example) until the overpayment
has been repaid. You must be notified in writing before deductions can take
place.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> From 1 August 2014, under the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Recovery-of-Benefits-and-Assistance.aspx">Recovery
of Certain Benefits and Assistance (RBA) Scheme</a> the Department of Social
Protection can recover the value of certain <a href="../../social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/benefits_to_people_who_are_sick_or_have_a_disability.html">illness-related
social welfare payments</a> from compensation awards made following non-fatal
personal injuries claims. <strong>This procedure is different from the recovery
of overpayments covered in this document. </strong></p>

<h3>Repaying the overpayment</h3>

<p>The Department can ask you to repay the overpayment by:</p>
<ul><li>Making a single payment to repay the full overpayment </li>
  <li>Making weekly or monthly cash repayments until the overpayment is paid
    off </li>
  <li>If you are still getting a social welfare payment, by deductions from
    your weekly payment (and by withholding any arrears of payment that may be
    due to you)</li>
</ul><p>When deciding the rate of repayment, the Department will look at the
following factors: </p>
<ul><li>Your ability to repay</li>
  <li>Any relevant facts or circumstances that you have raised</li>
  <li>The amount of the overpayment and how it happened </li>
</ul><h3>If you cannot afford to repay the overpayment</h3>

<p>The Department will suggest a repayment method that it believes you can
afford. If you cannot afford to repay the amount you were overpaid, the
repayment may be reduced, deferred or suspended. If your circumstances
subsequently improve, you will be required to repay the amount owed at a rate
you can afford. If you do not repay social welfare overpayments the Department
of Social Protection may take a civil case against you through the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/courts.html">courts system</a>. If
your overpayment arose as a result of fraud you may be criminally prosecuted
(see ‘Fraud’ below). </p>

<h3>What if you could have got paid under a different scheme</h3>

<p>If you received payments that you were not entitled to under one social
welfare scheme, but would have been entitled to payments under another scheme,
this will be taken into consideration in deciding how much you have to repay.
<br></p>

<h3>When is repayment reduced or cancelled?</h3>

<p>The Department of Social Protection makes every effort to recover the
overpayment in full. The Department may reduce or cancel an overpayment if it
occurred because it:</p>
<ul><li>Failed to act within a reasonable period of time on information it
    received about you</li>
  <li>Made an mistake that you could not reasonably be expected to have
  noticed</li>
</ul><p>If you think that the Department has made an error, you should bring the
matter to the Department's attention as soon as possible. </p>

<h3>Fraud</h3>

<p>If the overpayment happened as a result of fraud the Department can take a
criminal prosecution against you (even if you pay back the overpayment). The
most common types of welfare fraud include:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Concurrent working and claiming:</strong> Where a person claims a
    payment, such as Jobseeker's Benefit/Allowance or an illness payment, but
    takes up employment and does not notify the Department.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-disclosure of means:</strong> Where a person claims a
    means-tested payment but does not fully disclose their means or sources of
    income. Note that If you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant are
    getting a means tested social welfare payment and save a portion of this
    payment each week, these savings as well as savings from most other sources
    will be taken into account as part of your means. It is important to notify
    the Department of these savings to avoid an overpayment.</li>
  <li><strong>Multiple claiming or personation:</strong> Where a person makes a
    claim for more than one social welfare payment or by assuming and falsely
    using the identity and PPS Number of another person.</li>
  <li><strong>Life events:</strong> Where a person continues to claim a payment
    to which he/she is no longer entitled such as a lone parent who marries,
    enters into a civil partnership or is cohabiting, or someone who continues
    to claim Carer’s Allowance where caring duties have ceased.</li>
  <li><strong>Cohabitation:</strong> People may be living as a family unit and
    fail to notify this to the Department to qualify for higher rates of
    payments, or payments to which they may not be entitled.</li>
  <li><strong>Social insurance:</strong> Where employers fail to maintain
    appropriate employment/wage records and where non-compliance or
    non-remittance of PRSI (Pay Related Social Insurance) occurs.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-residency in the State:</strong> Where a person claims a
    social welfare payment which requires residency, and he/she is no longer
    resident.</li>

welfare payment each week.</p>

<p></p>

<p><a>The Social Welfare Act 2012 made changes to the suppliers that can be
paid under the Household Budget Scheme.</a> However, An Post must have an
agreement in place with the relevant supplier to make deductions from your
social welfare payment. You should speak to An Post to see if your supplier is
availing of the Household Budget facility. </p>

<p>If your service provider is not listed above, you cannot pay them under the
Household Budget Scheme. </p>

<p>You must be getting one of the social welfare payments listed above to apply
for the Household B<a></a>udget Scheme. </p>

<h3>How much can I deduct? <br></h3>

<p>You can opt to cover the full amount of the bill. You cannot however have
more than 25% of your total weekly social welfare payment deducted under this
scheme. A <a shape="rect" href="http://www.anpost.ie/AnPost/GeneralTemplates/ProductsAndServices.aspx?FRAMELESS=false&amp;NRNODEGUID=%7bA2B30CA6-BBC5-45CF-AA38-9DE8061E0822%7d&amp;NRORIGINALURL=%2fNR%2fexeres%2fA2B30CA6-BBC5-45CF-AA38-9DE80">minimum
amount must be deducted each week for each bill to be paid under the Household
Budget Scheme</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Rent deductions to a local authority:</strong> The amount deducted
per week will be equal to your weekly rent payment agreed with your housing
provider as long as the total payment is not greater than 25% of your weekly
flat payment.</p>

<p><strong>Utilities:</strong> The minimum weekly payment to any utility is
€5.</p>

<p>The deduction from your payment will be passed on to pay your bill within 4
days of you getting your payment at the post office. However if 25% of your
social welfare payment is not enough to meet all your deductions in a
particular week the local authority (housing body) deduction will be made
first.</p>

<h3>Can I change the amount deducted?</h3>

<p>Yes. To make changes to current deductions, you must complete a new
Household Budget Instruction Form and send it to the address below. If you want
to make changes to the deductions paid to a housing body you must include a
letter of authorisation from the housing body.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>How can I stop a deduction?</h3>

<p>To cancel a deduction you must give 2 weeks written notice to An Post (see
address below). Remember to give your name, address, <a shape="rect" href="../personal_public_service_number.html">PPS number</a> and details of the
deductions you want to cancel, including the account number. If you want to
cancel the deductions paid to a housing body you must include a letter of
authorisation from the housing body. <br></p>

months).</p>

<p>Note that for Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) which is paid monthly the
bonus is 85% of the <strong>weekly</strong> payment. The DCA portion of the
Bonus is calculated independently of other payments. So, for example, if you

Mobility Allowance, and rehabilitative training allowances from the HSE.

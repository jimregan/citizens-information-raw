<p>The Homemaker's Scheme makes it easier for a homemaker to qualify for the <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html">State
Pension (Contributory)</a>.</p>

<p>A homemaker, for the purposes of the Homemaker’s Scheme (which was
introduced from 6 April 1994), is a man or woman who provides full-time care
for a child under age 12 or an ill or disabled person aged 12 or over.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Under the Homemaker's Scheme any years that you spent as a homemaker (since
6 April 1994) are ignored or <em>disregarded</em> when working out your yearly
average contributions for a State Pension (Contributory). To be eligible, you
must:</p>
<ul><li>Permanently live in the State (except in cases where provisions under EU
    or posted worker regulations apply)</li>
  <li>Be aged under 66 </li>
  <li>Have started insurable employment or self-employment on or after the age
    of 16 and before the age of 56 </li>
  <li>Not work full-time, however, you can work and earn less than €38 gross
    per week </li>
  <li>Care full-time for a child under 12 or an ill or disabled person </li>
</ul><p>Before 26 October 2000, you were required to live with the person you were
caring for. Since 26 October 2000, if you are not living with this person:</p>
<ul><li>A direct system of communication must exist between your home and the
    person being cared for, for example by telephone or alarm system
    <em>and</em> </li>
  <li>The person being cared for must not be getting full-time care and
    attention within their own home from anyone else </li>
</ul><p>The person being cared for must be so disabled or incapacitated as to need:
</p>
<ul><li>Continuous supervision in order to avoid danger to himself or herself
  </li>
</ul><p><span>Or </span></p>
<ul><li>Continuous supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in
    connection with his or her normal personal needs </li>
</ul><p>It's important to note that only one person can be regarded as the homemaker
at any one time. If you stop being a homemaker and your spouse or civil partner
takes up homemaking duties, you should notify the Department
<span>immediately</span> to ensure there is no loss of entitlements under the
Homemaker's Scheme. </p>

<h3>Homemaking years</h3>

<p>A homemaking year is a year in which you are out of the workforce for the
full tax year (only a full year can be disregarded). Up to a maximum of 20
homemaking years can be disregarded for State Pension (Contributory)
purposes.</p>

<p>Homemaker’s credits can be awarded for part of a year at the start of the
homemaking period, from the date you become a homemaker up to the end of the
tax year. Likewise, homemaker’s credits can also be awarded for part of a
year when the homemaking period ends, from the start of the tax year up to the
date you stop homemaking. </p>

<h3>Registering as a homemaker</h3>

<p>You should register before the end of the contribution year after the year
in which you first become a homemaker. An application may be backdated if there
is a delay in submitting the claim. To register fill out the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/hm1.pdf">Homemaker's form (HM1) (pdf)</a>.
</p>

<p>You <span>do not need to register</span> if you:</p>
<ul><li>Are getting <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/carers/carers_allowance.html">Carer's Allowance</a>,
    <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/carers/carers_benefit.html">Carer's
    Benefit</a> or the <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/carers/respite_care_grant.html">Carer's Support
    Grant</a> </li>
  <li>Are getting <a shape="rect" href="../../payments_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child
    Benefit</a> and are providing the child(ren) with <span>full-time
    care</span> </li>
</ul><p>You do not need to register because your claim for Child Benefit, Carer's
Allowance, Carer's Benefit or the Carer's Support Grant is treated as an
application to be registered as a homemaker.</p>

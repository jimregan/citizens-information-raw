<div class="topic">

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Most employed people over 16 years of age make <a href="social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social insurance contributions</a>.
The amount you pay is based on your earnings and the type of work you do. For
this reason it is called Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI). </p>

<p>The law makes your employer responsible for PRSI, though you may have to pay
an <em>employee's share</em>. The amount of PRSI paid by you and your employer
depends on your social insurance class. Your social insurance class is in turn
determined by your earnings and the type of work you do. You can find more
information in our document on <a shape="rect" href="social_insurance_classes.html">social insurance classes</a>.</p>

<p>Your employer deducts your PRSI contribution directly from your wages. It is
then collected by Revenue and a record of your contributions is kept by both
your employer and the Department of Social Protection. Under the Payment of
Wages Act 1991, you must be given a <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/pay_slip.html">pay
slip</a> when you are paid. The PRSI contribution deducted should be noted on
your pay slip. </p>

<p>Your employer also pays PRSI contributions for you. This contribution is not
deducted from your pay. It is your employer's contribution to the <a shape="rect" href="social_insurance_in_ireland.html">Social Insurance Fund</a>.
Again, this is collected by Revenue and a record of the contribution is kept by
the Department of Social Protection. The Department publishes information for
employers - <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Employers-Guide-to-PRSI-Contributions---sw3.aspx">Employers'
guide to the Pay-Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contribution system - SW 3</a>
</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Budget 2016</h3>

<p>A new weekly tapered PRSI credit of €12 has been introduced for employees
insured at Class A whose earnings are between €352.01 and €424 in a week.
The maximum PRSI credit of €12 per week applies to gross weekly earnings of
€352.01. See 'Rates' below for examples of calculations. </p>

<p>The lower Class A rate of employer PRSI now applies to weekly earnings up to
€376. This threshold increased from €356 on 1 January 2016. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Your employer needs your <a shape="rect" href="../personal_public_service_number.html">Personal Public Service
Number</a> to make PRSI contributions for you. If your employer does not make
the correct PRSI contribution, your employer will be held responsible for the
cost of the entire contribution and any arrears that may be due. Failure to
meet this responsibility can mean that PRSI which has not been paid can be
recovered in court as a debt to the State.</p>

<p>If your employer does not make PRSI contributions on your behalf <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/PRSI---Inspections.aspx#chap3">they may be
required to repay to the Department certain social welfare payments you may
have received illegally while working for them (these benefits include Illness
Benefit, Jobseeker's Benefit, Jobseeker's Allowance, Pre Retirement Allowance,
Invalidity Pension, and Family Income Supplement).</a> Your employer may also
be liable for any benefit you have lost as a result of them not paying PRSI
contributions on your behalf or for repayment of social welfare assistance paid
to you in lieu of lost benefit. </p>

<h3>PRSI inspections</h3>

<p>Every year, inspectors from the Department of Social Protection visit many
employers. The purpose of these inspections is to find employers that:</p>
<ul><li>Do not pay any PRSI contributions for their employees </li>
  <li>Do not keep proper records for them </li>
  <li>Encourage employees to claim jobseeker payments </li>
  <li>Understate wages being paid to employees </li>
</ul><p>The Department's inspectors have power to inspect records and there are
penalties for people who obstruct or refuse to supply information, or fail to
keep or produce records and documents. </p>

<h3>Employees posted abroad</h3>

<p>In some cases, PRSI contributions from employees who are insurable under
Irish social security legislation but do not come within the <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/starting_work_and_changing_job/starting_work/tax_and_starting_work.html">PAYE
system</a> are collected by the Special Collection System operated by the
Department of Social Protection. </p>

<p>EU Regulations and bilateral social security agreements allow posted
workers, who are sent by their employer on short work assignments from Ireland
to the other country, to remain subject to Irish PRSI instead of transferring
to the social security system of the other country. For example, if you are
employed in Ireland and your employer sends you to work temporarily abroad in
another <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/european_government/european_union.html">EU
state</a> you will remain subject to the Irish PRSI system and will continue to
pay PRSI for 24 months. Your employer must complete an A1 form (formerly E101)
certificate (available from the PRSI Special Collection Unit) for inspection by
the social security authorities in the member state where you are sent to work.
More information is available on the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Paying-PRSI-through-the-Special-Collection-System.aspx">Special
Collection System (SW 63)</a>.</p>

<p>If an employer sends you to work temporarily in a country not covered by EU
Regulations or to a country with which Ireland does not have a Bilateral Social
Security Agreement, you remain liable for Irish PRSI contributions for up to 12
months. If the employment exceeds 12 months, it may be possible to remain
liable for Irish PRSI for longer than 12 months. Employees working abroad who
are not subject to the Irish PRSI system may opt to pay voluntary
contributions.</p>

<h3><strong>Workers posted to Ireland</strong></h3>

<p>A worker who is ordinarily resident in a country not covered by EU
Regulations, or with which Ireland does not have a Bilateral Social Security
Agreement and who is sent to work temporarily in Ireland by an employer who is
not ordinarily registered in Ireland nor has their principal place of business
in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain or the Isle of Man, may be exempt
from paying Irish PRSI contributions for up to 12 months.</p>

<h3>Paying PRSI contributions during illness</h3>

<p>If your employer pays you when you are sick, you will continue to pay PRSI.
Some employers will continue to pay you when you are out of work due to illness
provided you hand over to your employer any <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">Illness
Benefit</a> payment you get from the Department of Social Protection. In this
case, your employer only pays a PRSI contribution on the amount of sick pay
minus the amount of Illness Benefit. </p>

<p>If your employer pays you when you are ill and allows you to keep your
Illness Benefit payment, your employer's PRSI contribution is paid on the full
amount of the sick pay, ignoring the Illness Benefit payment. If your employer
does not pay you when you are absent from work through illness, no PRSI
contributions are due.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The amount of PRSI you and your employer pay will depend on your earnings
and the social insurance class you are insured under. </p>

<h4>Class A employees in 2016</h4>

<p>If you are earning <strong>less than €352</strong> gross per week (before
tax is deducted), you will not pay any social insurance. This does not mean
that you are not getting a contribution. You are still covered by Class A
social insurance. Your employer is paying social insurance on your behalf. </p>

<p>If you earn <strong>over </strong><strong>€352</strong> per week, you pay
4% PRSI on all your earnings. A new PRSI credit was introduced in 2016 which
reduces the amount of PRSI payable for people earning between €352.01 and
€424 per week. The credit is tapered and the amount of the credit depends on
your earnings. The maximum credit is €12. For example, if you earn €352.01
per week, you will get the maximum PRSI credit of €12. On these earnings of
€352.01, your PRSI charge (calculated at 4% of your earnings) would be
€14.08. After the €12 credit is deducted, you will pay PRSI of €2.08.</p>

<p>If you earn between €352.01 and €424 per week, the maximum credit of
€12 is reduced by one-sixth of the amount of your weekly earnings over
€352.01.</p>

<p>You work out how much PRSI you will pay in four steps. First, calculate
one-sixth of your earnings over €352.01. Then subtract this from the maximum
credit of €12 to get your PRSI credit. Then calculate the basic PRSI charge
at 4% of your earnings. Finally, deduct your PRSI credit from the PRSI charge.
The result is the amount of PRSI you pay.</p>

<p>For example, for gross weekly earnings of €377:</p>
<ol><li>One-sixth of your earnings over €352.01 is €377- €352.01 =
    €24.99, divided by 6 = €4.17.</li>
  <li>Subtract this from the maximum credit of €12, giving you a credit of
    €7.83.</li>
  <li>The basic PRSI charge is 4% of €377 = €15.08.</li>
  <li>You will pay €7.25 PRSI weekly in 2016 (€15.08 minus your €7.83
    PRSI credit).</li>

<p></p>

<h4>Employers' PRSI</h4>

<p>Employers pay 8.5% Class A employer PRSI on weekly earnings up to €376.
Employers pay 10.75% Class A employer PRSI on weekly earnings over €376. This
threshold increased from €356 to €376 on 1 January 2016.</p>

<p>Your employer deducts your PRSI contribution from your wages. As an employee
who pays PRSI contributions, you are entitled by law to inspect the PRSI record
kept by your employer about you. You can also get a statement of your record
from your employer every three months. </p>

<p>If you believe that your employer has not complied with social insurance
regulations you can ask to fill in form IA49 at your local social welfare
office or Intreo centre.</p>

<p>Form IA49 is a declaration stating that you believe your former employer did
not comply with social insurance regulations. As a result of this declaration,
there will be an investigation into your employer's payment of PRSI. </p>

<p>You can also contact the <a href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/secure/RequestSIContributionRecord.aspx">Records
Section in the Department of Social Protection to check your PRSI
record</a>.<br></p>

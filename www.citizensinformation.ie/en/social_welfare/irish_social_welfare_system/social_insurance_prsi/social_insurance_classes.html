<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>People in employment pay contributions to the Social Insurance Fund. The
contribution you pay depends on your earnings and occupation and therefore it
is called a Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contribution. Some people who
have unearned income are also liable for PRSI. There are currently 11 different
PRSI classes. They are A, B, C, D, E, H, J, K, M, S and P - see 'Further
information' below. The social insurance payments to which you may become
entitled depend on the PRSI class you are in. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Earnings-Bands-and-Subclasses-2015.aspx">Each
PRSI class is in turn divided into different subclasses</a>. These subclasses
do not affect your entitlements under the social insurance system. They only
relate to the amount of PRSI which you or your employer must pay. </p>

<p>PRSI is calculated on your <em>reckonable pay</em>. Reckonable pay is the
gross money pay plus notional pay (or <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/taxation_of_benefits_from_employment.html">benefit
in kind</a>) if applicable. There is no PRSI relief for employers on pension
contributions made by employees. There is some PRSI relief on pension
contributions paid by employers.</p>

<p>A wide range of payments are available to people who have paid social
insurance. If you are not a Class A contributor you are not entitled to the
full range of social insurance payments. This is because you are paying less
towards social insurance than a Class A contributor. In certain cases, if your
income falls below a certain amount you do not have to pay a social insurance
contribution, however, you will still be covered by social insurance because
your employer must pay social insurance for you. More information is available
in our document <a shape="rect" href="employer_s_duty_to_pay_social_insurance_prsi.html">Paying social
insurance</a>.</p>

<h3>PRSI contribution week</h3>

<p>Your working week may not be the same as the PRSI contribution week. The
PRSI contribution week starts on 1 January each year. Week one is the period
from 1 January to 7 January, week two is from 8 January to 14 January and so
on. For 2015, it started on Thursday and ended on Tuesday. In 2016 it starts on
Friday and ends on Wednesday. <a shape="rect" href="part_time_work_and_social_insurance_prsi.html">The contribution week can
affect the social insurance cover of part-time workers and people
job-sharing</a>. </p>

<h3>Budget 2016</h3>

<p>A new weekly tapered PRSI credit of €12 has been introduced for employees
insured at Class A whose earnings are between €352.01 and €424 in a week.
The maximum PRSI credit of €12 per week applies to gross weekly earnings of
€352.01. A person earning €352.01 pays €14.08 PRSI (4%). After the €12
credit is deducted they will pay PRSI of €2.08. For people earning between
€352.01 and €424, the credit of €12 is reduced by one-sixth of earnings
over €352.01. There is no PRSI credit once earnings exceed €424. </p>

<p>The lower Class A rate of employer PRSI now applies to weekly earnings up to
€376. This threshold increased from €356 to €376 in January 2016. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>PRSI classes and people insured in each class</h3>

<p>Most people pay Class A PRSI. It applies to people in industrial, commercial
and service type employment who are employed under a contract of service with a
reckonable pay of €38 or more per week from employment. It also includes
civil and public servants recruited from 6 April 1995. </p>

<p>Class A does not apply to people in insurable employment and over 66 years
of age. They are insurable under Class J.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="" name="Social_insurance_classes" id="Social_insurance_classes"></a>You can get more information about social
insurance classes and the occupations covered by each class in 'Further
information' below.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The <a href="employer_s_duty_to_pay_social_insurance_prsi.html">amount of
PRSI you and your employer pay</a> will depend on your earnings and the class
you are insured under. </p>

<h3>PRSI refunds</h3>

<p>If the wrong rate of PRSI is deducted from your wages you are entitled to a
refund. There are a number of reasons why you might be paying the wrong PRSI
rate. </p>

<p>To get a refund either you or your employer should contact the Refunds
Section in the Department of Social Protection - see 'Where to apply' below.
You will be sent a refund application form to fill out. If you have paid too
much PRSI you will get a refund and the Department will correct your social
insurance record. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you are an employee, your employer deducts your PRSI contribution from
your wages. Your employer then submits your contribution and their employer's
contribution to the Revenue Commissioners. <a shape="rect" href="employer_s_duty_to_pay_social_insurance_prsi.html">Your employer must
also pay social insurance on your behalf</a>. </p>

<p>If you are self-employed, you pay <a href="class_S_prsi.html">Class S
social insurance</a>. In this case, you pay your social insurance contributions
directly to the Revenue Commissioners. </p>

<p>If you are a PAYE worker and have unearned income of over €5,000 you are a
chargeable person and you must pay 4% PRSI under Revenue's self-assessment
system (Pay and File). Revenue pay the money into the Social Insurance Fund. A
record of the contributions you have paid is then sent to the Department of
Social Protection. </p>

<p><strong>Class A</strong> applies to people in industrial, commercial and
service type employment who are employed under a contract of service with a
reckonable pay of €38 or more per week from employment. It also includes
civil and public servants recruited from 6 April 1995. In fact, most employees
in Ireland pay PRSI Class A. People on CE schemes pay a special contribution at
Class A8/A9. </p>

<p><strong>Class J</strong> applies to people earning less than €38 per week.
However, people aged over 66 or people in subsidiary employment are always
insurable at Class J, no matter how much they earn. Subsidiary employment for
Class J is for example, people who are insurable at Class B, C, D or H in their
main employment. Only Occupational Injuries Benefit is covered by Class J
social insurance.</p>

<p><strong>Class E</strong> applies to ministers of religion employed by the
Church of Ireland Representative Body. It covers all social insurance payments
except Jobseeker's Benefit and Occupational Injuries Benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Class B</strong> applies to civil servants and Gardai recruited
before 6 April 1995, and registered doctors and dentists employed in the Civil
Service. It covers only a limited number of social insurance payments.</p>

<p><strong>Class C</strong> applies to commissioned Army Officers and members
of the Army Nursing service recruited before 6 April 1995. It covers only a
limited number of social insurance benefits.</p>

<p><strong>Class D</strong> applies to permanent and pensionable employees in
the public service other than those mentioned in Classes B and C recruited
before 6 April 1995. It covers only a limited number of social insurance
payments.</p>

<p><strong>Class H</strong> applies to NCOs and enlisted personnel of the
Defence Forces. It covers all social insurance payments except Occupational
Injuries Benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Class K</strong> applies to public office holders with an income of
over €5,200 a year. Public office holders with weekly income of €100 or
less are recorded under Class M. Class K also applies to people who pay PSRI on
unearned income. There are no social insurance payments for people insured
under Class K.</p>

<p><strong>Class M</strong> applies to employees with no liability to
contribute to social insurance such as employees under 16 years of age and
people with an income of €500 or less and insured in Class K. Class M covers
certain contributors with Occupational Injuries Benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Class S</strong> applies to self-employed people including certain
company directors, people in business on their own account and people with
income from investments and rents. It cover only a limited number of social
insurance payments.</p>

<p><strong>Class P</strong> applies to sharefishermen or sharefisherwomen who
are classified as self-employed and who are already paying PRSI under Class S.
It covers them for social insurance payments not covered by Class S. These
payments are as follows, limited Jobseeker's Benefit, limited Illness Benefit
and Treatment Benefit.</p>

pay, the Scope Section in the Department of Social Protection may decide the
issue after examining your employment situation. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="social_insurance_in_ireland.html">Pay Related Social
Insurance (PRSI)</a> contributions are deducted from your income and used to
fund social insurance payments, for example, State pensions. There are
different rates of PRSI for different categories. Most employees pay Class A
PRSI. If you are self-employed, you pay Class S PRSI. PRSI for self-employed
people was introduced in 1988.</p>

<p>People who pay Class S include farmers, professional people, certain company
directors, people in business on their own or in partnerships and people with
income from investments, rents or maintenance payments. Employees who are also
self-employed in a trade or profession pay Class S PRSI on that income as well
as their Class A PRSI contribution as an employee.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Class S contributions only cover you for a limited number of payments. In
general they do not cover you for any short-term payments including illness and
disability payments. They do not cover you for Jobseeker's Benefit. If you
satisfy all the other conditions, Class S contributions can entitle you to:</p>
<ul><li><a href="../../social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/maternity_benefit.html">Maternity
    Benefit</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/adoptive_benefit.html">Adoptive
    Benefit</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../social_welfare_payments/death_related_benefits/widows_contrib_pension.html">Widow's,
    Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../social_welfare_payments/older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html">State
    Pension (Contributory)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/treatment_benefit_scheme.html">Treatment
    Benefit Scheme</a></li>
</ul><p>Note that you cannot claim your State Pension (Contributory) until all
outstanding payments have been made. If you are aged over 66 and still owe
Class S PRSI contributions, your State Pension (Contributory) will only be paid
from the date that you have paid all outstanding contributions and any
outstanding income taxes in full.</p>

<p>The Department of Social Protection has published a leaflet <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/PRSI-for-the-Self-Employed---SW-74.aspx">PRSI
for the Self-Employed - SW74</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>If you are aged between 16 and 66 you pay Class S PRSI of 4% on all your
income for tax purposes, that is, gross income less allowable expenses. You
must pay 4% of all your income or €500, whichever is greater.</p>

<p>If you earn less than €5,000 from self-employment in a year you are exempt
from PRSI, but you may pay €500 as a <a href="voluntarysocialinsurancecontributions.html">voluntary contributor (if
you meet the other conditions)</a>.</p>

<p>You can read about <a href="social_insurance_in_ireland.html">employing

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you are self-employed, you pay <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it10.html#section8">Class S
social insurance contributions directly to Revenue</a>, when you send in your
tax returns for the year. Revenue then pays the money into the Social Insurance
Fund and sends a record of the contributions you have paid to the Department of
Social Protection. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/secure/RequestSIContributionRecord.aspx">You
can request a copy of your social insurance record online</a>. To check your
social insurance record, you will need your <a shape="rect" href="../personal_public_service_number.html">Personal Public Service
Number</a> (PPSN). </p>

<p>Note that you pay Class S contributions in an annual payment for your full
tax year. There is no mechanism for awarding credits for a full year or part of
a year.</p>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="lbdf95">Registering for PRSI</h2>

<p>When you take up self-employment you should inform Revenue that you are now
self-employed and you wish to register for self-assessment. You can register
with Revenue as <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/running/registering-tax.html#section2">a
self-employed sole trader online</a>. Certain people can only register on paper
using <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vat/forms/formtr1.pdf">Form TR1 -
Tax Registration form for Sole Traders, Trusts and Partnerships (pdf)</a>. When
you register for self-assessment with Revenue you will automatically become
registered for PRSI purposes with the Department of Social Protection.
Revenue’s online service can also be used to register for employers' PAYE and
PRSI and VAT, if you need to do so at this stage.</p>

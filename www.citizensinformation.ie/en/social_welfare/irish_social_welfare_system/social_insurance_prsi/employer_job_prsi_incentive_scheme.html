<p>The Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme exempted employers from liability
to pay their share of PRSI for certain employees. The scheme was open to
employers who create new and additional jobs.</p>

<p><strong>The Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme ceased on 30 June 2013 for
new participants.</strong> A new <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/jobsplus.html">JobsPlus
incentive scheme</a> has replaced the Employer Job (PRSI) Exemption Scheme and
<a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/revenue_job_assist.html">Revenue
Job Assist</a> from July 2013. </p>

<p>Existing participants on the Revenue Job Assist and Employer Job (PRSI)
Exemption Scheme (which both ceased for new participants on 30 June 2013) are
not affected by the new JobsPlus scheme.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To qualify for the Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme both the job you
create and the person you employ must meet certain criteria. While you are
waiting to be approved for the scheme, you should operate the standard employee
and employer PRSI.</p>

<p><strong>The person you employ</strong> must have been getting one of the
following social welfare payments for a period of at least 6 months (156
days):</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker's
    Benefit</a></li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
    Allowance</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent
    Family Payment</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability
    Allowance</a></li>
</ul><p>You can also employ an eligible person directly from <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/national_internship_scheme.html">JobBridge</a>
or <a shape="rect" href="../../../../education/vocational_education_and_training/fas_training_programmes_and_supports/fas_work_placement_programme.html">the
Work Placement Programme</a> once the required 156 days criteria has been
satisfied.</p>

training courses</a> can count towards the 6 month qualifying period provided
the person was getting one of the qualifying payments listed above immediately
before starting the scheme or course and, before starting work, would qualify
for one of the qualifying payments.</p>

<p>In addition, jobseekers payments paid in conjunction with periods of casual
employment and breaks in jobseekers payments as a result of periods of illness
during which Illness Benefit is paid may also count towards the qualifying
period.</p>

<p><strong>The job</strong> <strong>must</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>Be a new and additional post/job – employers are not allowed to
    substitute existing employees to avail of the scheme</li>
  <li>Be for at least 30 hours per week</li>
  <li>Last for at least 6 months. If the employment ends within 6 months of
    getting the exemption, you may be liable to pay the employer’s PRSI
    contributions for that employee.</li>
</ul><h3>Maximum participation rate</h3>

<p>You can only get an exemption from employer’s PRSI for a limited number of
employees. This limit is 5% of your existing workforce or, for smaller
companies, a maximum of 5 new jobs.<br></p>

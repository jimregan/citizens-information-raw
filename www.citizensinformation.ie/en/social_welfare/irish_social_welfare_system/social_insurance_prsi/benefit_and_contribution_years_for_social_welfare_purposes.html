<p>To qualify for most <a shape="rect" href="social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social insurance</a> payments in
Ireland, a person must satisfy two conditions, first have a certain number of
PRSI contributions paid since they started work <span>and</span> secondly, they
must have a certain number of PRSI contributions paid or credited in a specific
period, that is, in the relevant or governing contribution year. The number of
contributions needed varies from benefit to benefit.</p>

<p>The <span>Relevant Tax Year</span> or Governing Contribution Year is 2 years
before the <span>Benefit Year</span>. So, for claims in 2017, the Relevant
Contribution Year is 2015.</p>

<p>One exception to this is Invalidity Pension, the relevant tax year for
Invalidity Pension is the year before the benefit year. So, for claims in 2017,
the relevant tax year is 2016.</p>

<h3>The Benefit Year</h3>

<p>The Benefit Year is not the same as the calendar year which begins on 1
January. The Benefit Year is the 12 months beginning on the first Monday of the
calendar year. In 2017, the first Monday in January fell on 2 January,
therefore, claims made on 1 January would be based on an earlier Contribution
Year. In some cases, this could make a difference to the person claiming. </p>

<p>For example, a claim for Jobseeker's Benefit on 1 January 2017 would be
based on PRSI contributions in 2014, whereas a claim for Jobseeker's Benefit on
7 January 2017 would be based on PRSI contributions in 2015.</p>

<h3>Part-time workers</h3>

<p>If you are a part-time worker, you may not be making the maximum amount of
PRSI contributions each year. See <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/part_time_work_and_social_insurance_prsi.html">Part-time
work and social insurance (PRSI)</a> for more information.</p>

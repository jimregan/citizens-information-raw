<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Most employers and employees (over 16 years of age and under 66) pay social
insurance (PRSI) contributions into the national Social Insurance Fund. In
general, the payment of social insurance is compulsory. The term ‘insurable
employment is used to describe employment that is liable for social insurance
contributions. Some people who have unearned income are also liable for PRSI.
</p>

<p>The Social Insurance Fund is made up of a current account and an investment
account managed by the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for
Finance, respectively. The current account consists of monies collected from
people in employment. This money is then used to fund social insurance
payments. The investment account is a savings account that is managed by the
Minister for Finance. The <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/comptroller_and_auditor_general.html">Comptroller
and Auditor General</a> is responsible for ensuring that the accounts are kept
in order and reports are made to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/houses_of_the_oireachtas/">Houses
of the Oireachtas</a>.</p>

<h3>Social insurance classes</h3>

<p>Social insurance contributions are divided into different categories, known
as classes or rates of contribution. The class and rate of contribution you pay
is determined by the nature of your work. For example, a person employed in a
supermarket earning less than €38 per week will be insured under Class J. If
that person earned over €38, they would probably be insured under Class A.
Most employees pay Class A PRSI.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lfbad1">Work and social insurance</h2>

<p>If you are in employment, the amount of social insurance you pay depends on
your earnings and the type of work you do. Your social insurance contributions
in Ireland are referred to as PRSI (Pay Related Social Insurance). Sometimes,
you will hear people describe their PRSI contributions as stamps. This term
dated from before 1979 when employers would literally stamp a card each week of
employment. That card was then brought to a social welfare local office when
claiming social welfare payments.</p>

<p>If you are an employee, your PRSI contributions are deducted by your
employer and collected by Revenue under the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) system. In
fact, the law makes your employer responsible for PRSI, though you may have to
pay an 'employee's share'. <a shape="rect" href="employer_s_duty_to_pay_social_insurance_prsi.html">Find out more about
'Paying social insurance</a>'.</p>

<p>If you are self-employed, you pay <a href="class_S_prsi.html">Class S
social insurance contributions</a> directly to the Revenue Commissioners. The
Revenue Commissioners then pay the money into the Social Insurance Fund.
Revenue send a record of the contributions you have paid to the Department of
Social Protection. </p>

<p>You are not liable for PRSI contributions after the age of 66 - this is the
case whether or not you are employed or self-employed. If you do not have
enough contributions at age 66, you cannot add to them after that.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l09b20">Unearned income and social insurance</h2>

<p>From 2014 unearned income became fully liable for PRSI. Unearned income from
rents, investments, dividends and interest on deposits and savings is liable to
PRSI at 4% from 1 January 2014. People aged under 16 and over 66 are exempt
from PRSI and are not liable for the new charge. (In 2013 people paying
modified rate contributions (mainly civil and public servants recruited before
April 1995) became liable to PRSI of 4% (paid at Class K) on earned
self-employed income and any unearned income (from 1 January 2013) and on
self-employed income which comes under PAYE (from 28 June 2013).</p>

<p>Anyone with unearned income of over €5,000 (was €3,174) is considered to
be a 'chargeable person' and is liable to pay the PRSI charge at 4% on all
their unearned income. They pay the charge under Revenue's self-assessment
system (Pay and File). The new PRSI charge is paid at Class K and does not
entitle the person to any social insurance benefits.</p>

<p>PAYE tax payers who are not considered 'chargeable persons' by Revenue are
not liable for the new PRSI charge. A person is not a 'chargeable person' if
their income from non-PAYE sources is less than €5,000 (was €3,174) and
this income is taxed under the PAYE system. (Generally such income is taxed by
reducing a person’s tax credits to account for tax payable. However if you
have paid <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/tax_on_savings_and_investments/deposit_interest_retention_tax.html">Deposit
Interest Retention Tax (DIRT)</a> on your non-PAYE income you are not required
to pay further income tax on this income.)</p>

<h2>Employing family members and PRSI</h2>

<p>Most employees are liable to pay PRSI. <a>Exceptions to this general rule
apply in the case of certain f<em>amily employment</em></a>. This term is used
to describe a situation in which a self-employed sole trader either employs, or
is assisted in the running of the business by a specified family member(s). If
the business does not operate on a sole trader basis - for example if it is a
limited company or a partnership - it is not <em>family employment</em>.</p>

<p>The following categories of <em>family employment</em> are insurable under
the social insurance system in exactly the same way as employments that have no
family connection:</p>
<ul><li>If you are employed as an employee by a <em>prescribed relative</em> and
    the employment is not related to a private dwelling house or a farm in or
    on which both you and the employer live (PRSI Class A or Class J applies).
  </li>
  <li>If you are employed as an apprentice by a <em>prescribed relative</em>
    (even if the apprenticeship employment relates to a private dwelling house
    or a farm in or on which both you and the employer resides) there must be a
    registered contract of apprenticeship involved (PRSI Class A or Class J
    applies). </li>
  <li>If you assist your spouse or civil partner in the running of the family
    business but are not an employee (PRSI Class S applies)</li>
</ul><p><strong>A <em>prescribed relative</em> is a parent, grandparent, stepparent,
son, daughter, grandson, granddaughter, stepson, stepdaughter, brother, sister,
half-brother, or half-sister.</strong></p>

<p>The following categories of <em>family employment</em> are the exceptions
that are not covered by the social insurance system:</p>
<ul><li>•A spouse or civil partner employed by their self-employed spouse or
    civil partner</li>
  <li>If you are employed as an employee by a <em>prescribed relative</em> and
    the family employment relates to a private dwelling house or a farm in or
    on which both you and the employer reside </li>
  <li>If you assist or participate in the running of the family business but
    not as an employee. (For example, a son/daughter who is attending full-time
    education who participates in the business after school hours or but is not
    an employee.) </li>
</ul><p>Before 2014 spouses and civil partners of self-employed sole traders who
worked in the business (either as an employee or in another capacity) were not
liable for PRSI. From 2014 certain spouses and civil partners of self-employed
sole traders can pay PRSI and therefore establish entitlements to benefits in
their own right. People affected by this change are people who work in their
self-employed spouse or civil partner’s business doing similar or ancillary
(supporting) tasks but who are not business partners or employees. The €5,000
income threshold applies to these spouses or civil partners in the same way as
other self-employed people, so if a spouse or civil partner earns less than
this threshold they are not liable to pay PRSI.</p>

<p>If two or more family members (including spouses or civil partners) operate
a business as a partnership and share the profits each business partner is
insurable as a self-employed contributor (provided they earn over the €5,000
threshold).</p>

more about family employment.</a></p>

<p><strong>Points to note:<br></strong>PRSI Class M is used to record situations in which there is no
liability to social insurance.</p>

<p>Subject to certain conditions, if you cease to be covered by compulsory PRSI
you may opt to become insured on a voluntary basis and pay <a href="voluntarysocialinsurancecontributions.html">voluntary
contributions</a>.</p>

</ul><h3>Maintaining your social insurance</h3>

<p>It is important that you maintain, as far as possible, your social insurance
record. If you leave the workforce, it is important that you keep your social
insurance record active. To protect your social insurance record and keep it
active, you should contact the Department of Social Protection to check if you
can get <a shape="rect" href="credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">credited contributions</a>.
It may be possible in certain circumstances for you to make <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Topics/PRSI/Pages/volcons.aspx">voluntary
contributions</a>. You can also <a shape="rect" href="../claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/social_insurance_contributions_from_abroad.html">add
Irish contributions and contributions paid in certain other states while
working abroad together qualify for a social insurance payment</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a part-time worker or in a job-sharing work arrangement you
should be aware of how your pattern of work can affect your social insurance
record. This is particularly relevant if you are part-time or job-sharing with
a week off as part of your work pattern because you may miss out paying a PRSI
contribution for the week you are not working. <a shape="rect" href="part_time_work_and_social_insurance_prsi.html">Find out more about
part-time and job-share workers and social insurance contributions</a>.</p>

<p>All records of your insurance contributions are kept and managed by the PRSI
Records section in the Department of Social Protection. The Department is
responsible for the payments made as a result of your social insurance
contributions. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/secure/RequestSIContributionRecord.aspx">You
can request a copy of your social insurance record online</a>. To check your
social insurance record, you will need your <a shape="rect" href="../personal_public_service_number.html">Personal Public Service
Number</a> (PPSN). This number is a unique identification number which you need
when dealing with state agencies.</p>

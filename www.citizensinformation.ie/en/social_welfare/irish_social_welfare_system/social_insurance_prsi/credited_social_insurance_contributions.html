<div class="topic">

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are an employee, your employer makes <a href="social_insurance_in_ireland.html">Pay Related Social Insurance
(PRSI)</a> deductions from your earnings each week. These PRSI contributions to
the Social Insurance Fund can help you to qualify for social insurance
payments, such as Jobseeker's Benefit and State Pension (Contributory). If you
are out of work you may qualify for a <em>credited</em> contribution. </p>

<p>A <em>credited social insurance contribution</em> is a contribution given to
you and recorded on your social insurance record. In some cases you can combine
your paid and credited contributions to help you qualify for a <a shape="rect" href="social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social insurance payment</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To qualify for a <em>credit</em> you must have worked and paid at least one
PRSI contribution at PRSI Class A, B, C, D, E, or H and have paid or credited
contributions in either of the last two completed tax years. For example, if
you are applying for credits in 2015 you must have paid or credited
contributions in either 2014 or 2013. If there is a gap of more than
<strong>two completed tax years</strong> you must work and pay contributions
for a further 26 weeks before you qualify for credited contributions.</p>

<p>Credits are usually awarded at the same rate as your last paid PRSI
contribution. Your credit will only help you to qualify for the social
insurance payments appropriate to your PRSI class. For example, if your last
paid PRSI contribution was Class A your credits will be for Class A. If
however, your last PRSI contribution was at Class B your credits will be for
Class B. More information is available about <a shape="rect" href="social_insurance_classes.html">social insurance classes and the social
welfare payments for each class</a>.</p>

<h3>Pre-entry credits when you start work</h3>

<p>When you start work you are automatically given <em>pre-entry credits</em>.
These credits are normally given once and cover you from the beginning of the
tax year in which you start work, up to the <em>actual </em>date you start
work. The <em>credits</em> also cover you for the two previous income tax
years. Your pre-entry credits can help you to qualify for the following social
insurance payments:</p>
<ul><li>Illness Benefit </li>
  <li>Jobseeker's Benefit </li>
  <li>Treatment Benefit </li>
  <li>Maternity Benefit </li>
  <li>Adoptive Benefit </li>
  <li>Health and Safety Benefit </li>
</ul><h3>Credits during unemployment</h3>

<p>You get credits automatically if you are fully unemployed and getting
Jobseeker's Benefit. You can continue to get credits if you have used up your
entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit and qualify for Jobseeker's Allowance. </p>

<p>You <em>do not</em> automatically get credits if you are getting Jobseeker's
Allowance. You must have paid or credited PRSI contributions in either of the
last two tax years to get credits with Jobseeker's Allowance. </p>

<p>You can sign on for credits, if you are not entitled to a social welfare
payment or you are a qualified adult on your spouse's, civil partner's or
cohabitant's social welfare payment as long as you:</p>
<ul><li>Are unemployed</li>
  <li>Available and capable of work</li>
  <li>Genuinely seeking work</li>
  <li>Have paid or credited PRSI contributions in either of the last two tax
    years</li>
</ul><p>You can also sign on for credits if you are on strike from work. You must
sign on for credits in your Intreo centre or social welfare local office - see
'Where to apply' below. </p>

<p>If you are unemployed and getting credits you can continue to get credits if
you take part in one of the following:</p>
<ul><li>Back to Education Allowance Scheme (BTEA)</li>
  <li>Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) </li>
  <li>FET (formerly FÁS)/Cert/BIM/Teagasc training courses </li>
</ul><p>If you qualify for the BTEA Scheme after signing on for credits you take
part on a non-payment basis. This means that you do not get a weekly Back to
Education Allowance. </p>

<h3>Credits during illness</h3>

<p>Credits are awarded if you are getting <a href="../../social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">Illness
Benefit</a>, <a href="../../social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/injury_benefit.html">Injury
Benefit</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/disability_and_illness/invalidity_pension.html">Invalidity
Pension</a><a href="../../social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/injury_benefit.html"></a>.
If you use up your entitlement to Illness Benefit or Injury Benefit and you
qualify for Disablement Benefit you should continue to submit medical
certificates to ensure that you continue to get credits. If you have applied
for Illness Benefit or Injury Benefit and don't qualify, you may still be
entitled to credits if you have paid or credited contributions in the last two
tax years.</p>

<p>If you are getting <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability
Allowance</a> because you have used up your entitlement to Illness Benefit you
will get credits. To get credits while on Disability Allowance you must have
paid or credited contributions in the last two years. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/OperationalGuidelines/Pages/credcontribsps.aspx">Public
servants who give up work because of ill health</a> can protect their
entitlement to certain payments by sending in medical certificates once a
year.</p>

<p>You can continue to get credits during illness, if you take part in the <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">Back
to Education Allowance Scheme</a>. </p>

<h3>Credits for carers</h3>

<p>If you give up work to care for someone and get <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/carers/carers_allowance.html">Carer's Allowance</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../../payments/carers/carers_benefit.html">Carer's
Benefit</a> you will be awarded credits. You will also get credits if you do
not get one of these payment but are on <em></em><a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/carers_leave_from_employment.html">Carer's
Leave</a> from work. If however, you avail of unpaid statutory Carer's Leave
you must get your employer to complete an <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/carl_credits.pdf">application for carer's
leave 'credits'</a> (pdf) when you return to work.</p>

<h3>Credits and homemakers</h3>

<p>The <a href="homemakers_scheme.html">Homemaker's Scheme</a> can make it
easier for homemakers to qualify for a State Pension (Contributory). If you
give up work to look after a child under 12 years of age, or a disabled child,
or adult, you can get <em>credits</em> from the date you give up work to the
end of that contribution year. If you are out of the workforce for the complete
contribution year the complete year is disregarded when you are assessed for a
State Pension (Contributory). </p>

<p>In some cases people who are jobsharing may be eligible for <em>homemakers
credits</em> if they are job-sharing to look after a child under 12 or a
disabled child or adult.</p>

<h3>Student credits</h3>

<p>Student credits are only given once, and can cover periods in full-time
education. To qualify you must have worked and paid PRSI Class A before
starting your course. You must have started your course before you reached 23
years of age and before you have taken up full-time insurable employment. You
apply for <em>student credits</em> when you are applying for a social insurance
payment. You must supply written confirmation from the school or college
stating that you were a student there, and the dates you attended. You may also
have to show that you have started full-time employment. This can mean
submitting your <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/no_p45_no_p60.html">P60</a>
or a letter from your employer.</p>

<h3>Credits for maternity leave, adoptive leave, parental leave, Health and
Safety Benefit.</h3>

<p>You will automatically be awarded <em>credits </em>while you are getting
Maternity Benefit, Adoptive Benefit or Health and Safety Benefit. </p>

<p>If however you avail of <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/maternity_leave.html">unpaid
statutory maternity leave</a> you must get your employer to complete an <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/matl_credits.pdf">application
for maternity leave credits</a> (pdf) when you return to work. Similarly, if
you avail of <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/adoptive_leave.html">unpaid
statutory adoptive leave</a> you must get your employer to complete an <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/al_credits.pdf">application for

<p>If you take <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/parental_leave.html">parental
leave</a>, your employer must contact the Records Section of Department of
Social Protection, detailing the weeks you have not worked, so that you can get

<h3>Volunteer development worker's credits</h3>

<p>If you spend time as a volunteer development worker abroad, you may be
entitled to credits for the time you spend as a volunteer development worker
abroad up to a maximum of five years. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Volunteer-Development-Worker-Scheme---SW-15.aspx">Volunteer
development worker's credits</a> can help you to maintain your social insurance
record. </p>

<h3>Change of status credits</h3>

<p>You may qualify for change of status credits if you are insurably employed
at PRSI Class A and your last paid PRSI contribution was at Class B, C or D.
These change of status credits are only taken into account for the State
Pension (Contributory). You can get change of status credits back to the
beginning of the tax year in which you start making PRSI contributions at the
Class A rate and for the previous tax year. A mixture of PRSI contributions at
Class A and PRSI contributions at Class B, C or D may help you to qualify for a
mixed insurance pro-rata State Pension (Contributory). </p>

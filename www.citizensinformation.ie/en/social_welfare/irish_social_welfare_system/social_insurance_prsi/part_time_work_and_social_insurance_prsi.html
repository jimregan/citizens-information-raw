<p>Part-time workers over 16 years of age and earning over â‚¬38 in each
<em>PRSI contribution</em> week are liable to contribute to social insurance.
It is called <a shape="rect" href="social_insurance_in_ireland.html">Pay
Related Social Insurance (PRSI)</a> because the amount of social insurance you
pay depends on your earnings and the type of work you do. </p>

<p>If you are a part-time worker you may not be making the maximum amount of
PRSI contributions each year. The tax year and the PRSI contribution week start
1 January every year. As a result, the <strong>PRSI contribution week</strong>
can differ from the <strong>working week</strong><em>.</em> If you are in
part-time work you need to be fully aware of the possible effect this can have
on your social insurance entitlements. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>In general, you pay a PRSI contribution in respect of each PRSI contribution
week in which you work. You must be <strong>working on at least 1 day in each
PRSI contribution week</strong> in order to pay a contribution. </p>

<p>If you have a week-on, week-off work pattern, you may miss a number of
contributions if the week you are off coincides with the PRSI contribution
week. This can happen whether you work a full 5 days every second week (such as
Monday to Friday) or if you work a split week, such as Wednesday to Friday one
week, followed by Monday and Tuesday the next. It all depends on the starting
day of the PRSI contribution week, which is determined by where 1 January falls
each year.</p>

<h3>Example: PRSI contribution week runs from Monday</h3>

<p>In a year when 1 January falls on a Monday, then each PRSI contribution week
in that year runs from Monday to the following Sunday. If your work pattern is
week-on, week-off, Monday to Friday, you miss paying PRSI in every second PRSI
contribution week, as you are not working at all during each of those weeks. In
this situation, you would pay only 26 contributions in the year.</p>

<p>Similarly, if your pattern is Monday to Friday for 3 weeks, with 1 week off,
you would pay 39 contributions in the year.</p>

<p>However, if you work Wednesday to Friday in one week, followed by Monday and
Tuesday the next, you will pay the full 52 contributions in the year, as you
will have worked during each Monday-Sunday PRSI contribution week.</p>

<h3>Situation in 2017</h3>

<p>In 2017, 1 January fell on a Sunday. This means that each PRSI contribution
week runs from Sunday to Saturday. If your part-time work arrangement requires
that you work part of every week between Sunday and Saturday, you will have
your full 52 PRSI contributions for 2017. However, if you work a pattern of one
week on, one week off, Monday to Friday, you will only get 26 weeks of
contributions in 2017.</p>

<p>In 2016 1 January fell on a Friday which meant that each PRSI contribution
week ran from Friday to Thursday. If your part-time work arrangement required
that you work part of every week between the days Monday to Saturday, you will
have received your full 52 PRSI contributions for 2016. </p>

<p>In 2015 1 January fell on a Thursday which meant that each PRSI contribution
week ran from Thursday to Wednesday. If your part-time work arrangement
required that you work part of every week between the days Monday to Saturday,
you will have received your full 52 PRSI contributions for 2015. However if you
work a split week which starts on a Thursday you will only get 26 weeks of
contributions in 2015. If your split week starts on any other day you will get
the full 52 weeks of contributions.</p>

<p>In 2014 1 January fell on a Wednesday which means that each PRSI
contribution week ran from Wednesday to Tuesday. If your part-time work
arrangement required that you work part of every week between the days Monday
to Saturday, you will have received your full 52 PRSI contributions for 2014.
However if you worked a split week which starts on a Wednesday you will only
get 26 weeks of contributions in 2014. If your split week starts on any other
day you will get the full 52 weeks of contributions.</p>

<p>In 2013, 1 January fell on a Tuesday which meant that each PRSI contribution
week ran from Tuesday to Monday. If your part-time work arrangement required
that you work part of every week between the days Monday to Saturday, you will
have received your full 52 PRSI contributions for 2013. However if you work a
split week which starts on a Tuesday you will only get 26 weeks of
contributions in 2013. If your split week starts on any other day you will get
the full 52 weeks of contributions.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Paying social insurance can help you to qualify for social insurance
payments, such as the State Pension (Contributory). If you are an employee Pay
Related Social Insurance (PRSI) deductions are made from your earnings each
week. </p>

<p>If you are no longer an employee or if you are self-employed and you are no
longer making compulsory PRSI contributions, you can opt to make voluntary
contributions. If you are getting a social welfare payment or <a href="credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">signing for credits</a>
you may get credited contributions which will also keep your social insurance
record up to date. </p>

<p>Voluntary contributions can help maintain your social insurance record and
help you to qualify for social insurance payments in the future. They cover
long-term benefits such as pensions. They do not cover short-term benefits for
illness, maternity or jobseekers. </p>

<p>You can choose to pay voluntary contributions (if you are under 66 and meet
the other conditions) if you:</p>
<ul><li>Are no longer covered by compulsory PRSI in Ireland</li>
  <li>Are no longer covered by PRSI on a compulsory or voluntary basis in
    another EU country</li>
</ul><p>If you are working outside the EU and not subject to Irish or EU social
insurance contributions you may also opt to pay voluntary contributions.</p>

<p>If you are taking time off work to care for children under 12 years of age,
or a disabled child or adult, the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/sw1.pdf">Homemaker’s Scheme</a> may
be a better option than making voluntary contributions.</p>

<h3>Changes to PRSI requirements for voluntary contributors</h3>

<p>From <strong>6 April 2015</strong> you need <strong>520 paid PRSI
contributions</strong> (10 years)<strong></strong> to be eligible to make
voluntary contributions:<strong></strong></p>
<ul><li>People who became voluntary contributors after 6 April 2014 and before 6
    April 2015 needed <strong>468 PRSI</strong> paid contributions (9
  years)</li>
  <li>People who became voluntary contributors after 6 April 2013 but before 6
    April 2014 needed <strong>364 PRSI</strong> paid contributions (7
  years)</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To be eligible to make voluntary contributions you must:</p>
<ul><li>Have at least <strong>520 PRSI</strong> contributions paid under
    compulsory insurance in either employment or self-employment</li>
  <li>Apply to make your voluntary contribution within 60 months (5 years) of
    the end of the last completed tax year (contribution year) during which you
    last paid compulsory insurance or you were last awarded a credited
    contribution. (From February 2017, the time limit for making voluntary
    contributions is extended from 12 months to 60 months.)</li>
  <li>Agree to pay voluntary contributions from the start of the contribution
    week that follows the week in which you leave compulsory insurance</li>
</ul><p>The contribution year is the same as the income tax year so it runs from
January to December.</p>

<p>You cannot use contributions paid in Class J to satisfy these conditions.
However, you may pay PRSI at Class J and voluntary contributions at the same
time. You <strong>stop paying voluntary contributions</strong> either when you
reach 66 years of age or start paying PRSI again.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>There are three rates of voluntary contributions. The rate of voluntary
contribution you pay is linked to the last PRSI contribution paid or credited
by you. More information is available about <a shape="rect" href="social_insurance_in_ireland.html">paying social insurance</a>.</p>

<p><strong>If you paid PRSI at Class A, E or H you pay a high rate contribution
of 6.6%</strong> of your reckonable income in the previous tax year, subject to
a minimum payment of €500. The social insurance payments you may be entitled
to by making voluntary contributions at this rate are:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html">State
    Pension (Contributory)</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/death_related_benefits/widows_contrib_pension.html">Widow’s,
    Widower’s or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../payments/death_related_benefits/guardians_payments.html">Guardian’s
    Payment (Contributory)</a> </li>
</ul><p><strong>If you paid PRSI at Class B, C or D you pay a low rate contribution
of 2.6%</strong> of your reckonable income in the previous tax year, subject to
a minimum payment of €250. The social insurance payments you may be entitled
to by making voluntary contributions at this rate are:</p>
<ul><li>Widow’s, Widower’s or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory)
    Pension </li>
  <li>Guardian’s Payment (Contributory) </li>
</ul><p><strong>If you paid PRSI at Class S you pay a special flat rate of

voluntary contributions at this rate are:</p>
<ul><li>State Pension (Contributory) </li>
  <li>Widow’s, Widower’s or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory)
    Pension </li>
  <li>Guardian’s Payment (Contributory) </li>
</ul><p>You can pay voluntary contributions by cheque, banker’s draft or standing
order. Your contribution can be paid as a lump sum before the end of the
contribution year or by quarterly or half-yearly installments during the
contribution year. You must pay the full contribution for a year no later than
5 months after the end of the year in which the payment is due. </p>

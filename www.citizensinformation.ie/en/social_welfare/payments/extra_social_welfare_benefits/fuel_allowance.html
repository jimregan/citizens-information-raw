<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>A Fuel Allowance is a payment under the National Fuel Scheme to help with
the cost of heating your home during the winter months. It is paid to people
who are dependent on long-term social welfare payments and who are unable to
provide for their own heating needs. Only one Fuel Allowance is paid to a
household. Fuel Allowance is paid with your social welfare payment on the day
that you are usually paid.</p>

<p>The 2016-2017 Fuel Allowance season started on Monday 3 October 2016 and
ended on Friday 31 March 2017. <strong>The 2017-2018 season will begin on
Monday 2 October 2017.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Information-for-customers-in-financial-difficulty-with-their-energy-bills.aspx">The
Department of Social Protection has published information on what to do if you
are in financial difficulty with your energy bills</a>.</p>

<p>Some UK pensioners living in Ireland may be eligible for a <strong>Winter
Fuel Payment</strong> from the UK. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/winter-fuel-payment/overview">find out more from
gov.uk</a>. </p>

<h3>Keeping well and warm in winter</h3>

<p>Coping with cold weather can be difficult especially if you are older or
have a disability or a long-term illness. The <a href="http://www.seai.ie/WellandWarm/">Keeping Well and Warm website</a> gives
information and advice about the supports available to help you and your
household keep well and warm during the winter. </p>

    is payable to people who have been getting a jobseeker’s payment for 391
    days, if they satisfy the relevant qualifying conditions. Days of
    unemployment on Jobseeker's Benefit count towards the 391 days if the
    Jobseeker’s Benefit claim was immediately before the award of
    Jobseeker’s Allowance. You can keep your Fuel Allowance if you move from
    One-Parent Family Payment, Carer’s Allowance or Jobseeker’s

  <li>Or if you are taking part in certain schemes - Back to Work Allowance,
    Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA), Rural Social Scheme, Tús,
    JobBridge, Revenue Job Assist or Community Employment and are entitled to

</ul><p><span>And</span></p>

<p>You live alone or <span>only with</span>:</p>
<ul><li>A dependent spouse, civil partner or cohabitant and/or dependent children
  </li>
  <li>Other people getting one of the qualifying payments who would also be
    eligible for a Fuel Allowance in their own right </li>
  <li>A person who is getting Carer's Allowance or Carer's Benefit and is
    caring for you or for your dependent spouse, partner or cohabitant</li>
  <li>A person getting short-term Jobseeker's Allowance or basic Supplementary
    Welfare Allowance</li>
</ul><p><span>And</span></p>

<p>You and other members of your household are unable to provide for your
heating needs from your own resources. </p>

<p>You will not qualify for a Fuel Allowance if:</p>
<ul><li>Your heating needs are met under a <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/owning_a_home/buying_a_home/property_deeds.html">deed</a>
    transferring property </li>
  <li>You live with someone who is not getting one of the qualifying payments
    for the Fuel Allowance </li>
  <li>You are on a contributory payment and have income above the means test
    limits (see below)</li>
</ul><h4>Carer's Allowance </h4>

<p>Carer's Allowance is not a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance. However
you may qualify for Fuel Allowance if you are getting half-rate Carer's
Allowance and another qualifying social welfare payment: </p>
<ul><li>If you are getting a non-contributory social welfare payment and a
    half-rate Carer's Allowance then Fuel Allowance is payable (if you meet all
    the criteria). </li>
  <li>If you are getting a contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate
    Carer's Allowance then the value of the half-rate Carer's Allowance will be
    assessed in the means test for Fuel Allowance (see below).</li>
</ul><h3>Means test for Fuel Allowance</h3>

<p>Fuel Allowance is a means-tested payment. If you are getting a
non-contributory payment you are accepted as satisfying the means test. If you
are on an employment support scheme or if you are getting a Back to Education
Allowance you are entitled to keep your Fuel Allowance if you continue to
satisfy the conditions – including the means test. </p>

<p>The Fuel Allowance means test is linked to the maximum rate of the State
Pension (Contributory). </p>

<p>You can have a combined weekly income of €100 above the maximum State
Pension (Contributory) for your situation and still be eligible for a Fuel
Allowance. This means that you can have capital/savings, providing they are
less than €58,000, and be eligible for a Fuel Allowance. (€58,000 is
equivalent to just over €100 a week under the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Means-Assessment.aspx#appendix">capital
means assessment rules</a>.) </p>

<p>For example: </p>
<ul><li>The assessable income limit for a single person under 80 is €338.30
    (€100 plus €238.30)</li>
  <li>The assessable income limit for a couple (where the qualified adult is
    under 66) is €497.10 (€100 plus €238.30 plus €158.80)</li>
  <li>The assessable income limit for a couple (where the qualified adult is 66
    or over) is €551.80 (€100 plus €238.30 plus €213.50)</li>
</ul><p>If you are over 80, add an extra €10 to the appropriate DSP payment
rate.</p>

<h3>Getting a pension or benefit from another country</h3>

<p>If you are getting a pension/benefit or equivalent payment from a country
covered by EU Regulations or a country with which Ireland has a Bilateral
Social Security Agreement (provided there is an equivalent Irish payment), you
may qualify for a Fuel Allowance provided you satisfy the qualifying conditions
mentioned above and you are:</p>
<ul><li>Resident in Ireland </li>
</ul><p><span>And</span></p>
<ul><li>Aged 66 or over </li>
</ul><p><span>Or</span></p>
<ul><li>Under 66 and getting an Invalidity Pension (for over 12 months), a
    Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Pension or an equivalent
    payment from another country. </li>
</ul><h3>Where more than one person in a household qualifies</h3>

<p>Only one Fuel Allowance payment will be paid to a household. If two or more
people who each qualify for a Fuel Allowance are living in the same household,
a single Fuel Allowance is paid to one qualified person in that household. The
table shows who should apply for a Fuel Allowance in the case of two or more
qualifying individuals living in the same house. </p>

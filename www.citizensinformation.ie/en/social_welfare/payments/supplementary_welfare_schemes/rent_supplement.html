<p></p>

<p>Rent Supplement is a means-tested payment for certain people living in
private rented accommodation who cannot provide for the cost of their
accommodation from their own resources.</p>

<p>In the past, you could apply for Rent Supplement if you were qualified for
social housing support and were on the local authority’s housing list.
However, people in this situation should now apply for the Housing Assistance
Payment (HAP). You will only qualify for Rent Supplement if you meet the
eligibility criteria as specified in ‘Rules’ below.</p>

<p></p>

<h3></h3>

<h3>Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)</h3>

<p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a form of social housing support for
people who have a long-term housing need. It is available in all local
authority areas throughout the State. <strong>HAP will eventually replace
long-term Rent Supplement</strong>.</p>

<p>The HAP scheme aims to allow all social housing supports to be accessed
through the local authorities and to enable people to take up full-time
employment and keep their housing support. <a href="../../../housing/renting_a_home/housing_assistance_payment.html">Read
more in our document on HAP</a> and on <a href="http://hap.ie/">hap.ie</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Landlords</h3>

<p>Tax relief is available for landlords who rent to tenants getting Rent
Supplement or HAP. Read more in our document on <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/housing_tax_credits_and_reliefs.html">Housing
tax credits and reliefs</a>.</p>

<p>Equality legislation specifies a number of grounds under which landlords
cannot discriminate against potential tenants. These include the “housing
assistance” ground. Read more in ‘Discrimination when letting residential
property’ below.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Eligibility criteria for Rent Supplement following the introduction of the
Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) </h3>

<p>As noted above, HAP is now available nationwide. If you qualify for social
housing support and you need help with your rent, you should apply for HAP. You
are only eligible for Rent Supplement if you are a genuine (bona fide) tenant
and meet one of the following conditions:</p>
<ul><li>You were getting Rent Supplement in the 12 months before the date of your
    application.</li>
  <li>You were living in private rented accommodation for at least 6 months
    (183 days) of the last 12 months, you could afford the rent at the
    beginning of your tenancy and you are unable to continue to pay the rent
    because of a substantial change in your circumstances which occurred after
    you started renting. You can combine time living in more than one rented
    accommodation to satisfy the 6 months (183 days).</li>
  <li>You were living in accommodation for homeless people for at least 6
    months (183 days) of the last 12 months. If you have already been assessed
    as qualified for social housing support you will be referred to your local
    authority to have your housing needs addressed (rather than being assessed
    for Rent Supplement).</li>
</ul><p>If you need help with your rent but you don’t meet these conditions, you
must contact your local authority to have your housing needs assessed. If you
are eligible for and in need of housing support you may be able to access
housing under the <a href="../../../housing/renting_a_home/housing_assistance_payment.html">HAP
scheme</a> or <a href="../../../housing/local_authority_and_social_housing/applying_for_local_authority_housing.html">local
authority housing</a>.</p>

<p>If you are currently getting long-term Rent Supplement (18 months or more)
you can be asked to apply for social housing support to your local authority.
You must apply within 6 weeks of being asked to do so (if necessary an extra 6
weeks can be allowed). You may then be transferred to HAP or to another form of
social housing support. </p>

<h2>Other rules for Rent Supplement</h2>

<p>Rent Supplement will only be provided if the accommodation is suitable for
your needs. Rent Supplement is not generally paid if the rent is above the
maximum rent limit set for your county (see ‘Rates’ below for information
about these limits and circumstances where they may be waived).</p>

<p><strong>You must also:</strong> </p>
<ul><li>Pass a <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitual
    residence test</a> </li>
  <li>Pass a means test</li>
</ul><p><strong>You won’t qualify for Rent Supplement if you:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Are in full-time employment or self-employment (30 hours or more a week).
    However, if you are assessed as in need of housing under the Rental
    Accommodation Scheme and have been out of full-time employment for 12
    months or more you may be entitled to the Supplement - see ‘Employment
    and Rent Supplement’ below </li>
  <li>Are leaving local authority housing without reasonable cause.</li>
  <li>Have been excluded from social housing by a local authority for reasons
    of good estate management or anti-social behaviour.</li>
  <li>Are attending full-time education. However, if you are getting a <a shape="rect" href="../back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">Back to
    Education Allowance (BTEA)</a>, are participating in the <a shape="rect" href="../back_to_education/back_to_education_programme.html">Back to
    Education Programme</a> or in the <a href="../../../education/vocational_education_and_training/training_and_apprentiship_programmes/courses_for_long_term_unemployed_people.html">Momentum
    Programme</a> you may be entitled to Rent Supplement.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Renting from a parent:</strong> You cannot get Rent Supplement to
help you pay rent to your parent if you are living in the family home. If your
parent owns a second property, you will generally not get Rent Supplement for
this property unless you can prove that you are a genuine (bona fide)
tenant.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing with your landlord:</strong> You may be entitled to get Rent
Supplement if <a href="../../../housing/renting_a_home/sharing_accommodation_with_your_landlord.html">you
are living in your landlord’s home</a>. It must be a genuine landlord/tenant
arrangement. Your landlord has to fill in part of the form and provide his or
her PPS number (see 'How to apply' below). </p>

<h3>Employment and Rent Supplement </h3>

<p>You will <strong>not </strong>qualify for Rent Supplement if you are in
full-time employment - defined as 30 hours or more a week. (In the case of
couples, if one of a couple is in full-time employment, both are excluded from
claiming Rent Supplement.) Claims from self-employed people are assessed on the
individual circumstances of the case and you may be asked to show that you are
working less than 30 hours a week. If you are working over 30 hours a week in
employment or self-employment, or if you are getting the Back to Work
Enterprise Allowance, you must be deemed eligible for the <a href="../../../housing/local_authority_and_social_housing/rental_accommodation_scheme.html">Rental
Accommodation Scheme (RAS)</a> by your local authority to continue to get Rent
Supplement. </p>

<p>However, you will be reassessed for Rent Supplement and some of your
additional income including some of your income from employment will be taken
into account. As a result of the reassessment you may or may not continue to
qualify for Rent Supplement. If you do qualify for Rent Supplement you may get
a different rate of Supplement.</p>

<h3>Income taken into account for Rent Supplement</h3>
<ul><li>Net income from employment (this is gross income less PRSI and reasonable
    travel expenses. A <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_and_increase_in_your_payment_for_a_child_dependant.html">child
    dependant</a> in full-time education does not have their income from
    employment assessed as means for Rent Supplement.) </li>
  <li>Social welfare payments (for exceptions - see 'Income not taken into
    account' below) </li>
  <li>Family Income Supplement (FIS)</li>
  <li>Cash income (for example, maintenance) </li>
  <li>All income and the value of all property of which the claimant deprived
    themselves in order to qualify for Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA)*
  </li>
  <li>Capital (for example, property except your own home, savings and
    investments). </li>
</ul><p>*SWA is the scheme under which Rent Supplement is paid.</p>

<p>The capital value of property (except your own home), savings and
investments is assessed as follows:</p>

<h3>Income not taken into account when calculating Rent Supplement</h3>

<p>Income from the following sources is <em>disregarded</em> - not taken into
account - when calculating the amount of Rent Supplement you qualify for: </p>
<ul><li>An amount equal to the <a shape="rect" href="supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary Welfare Allowance
    (SWA)</a> rate for your household circumstances </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child

  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../../../travel_and_recreation/transport_and_disability/mobility_allowance.html">Mobility
    Allowance</a> </li>
  <li>Foster care payments from the Health Service Executive (HSE) </li>
  <li>Payments for accommodating children under the Child Care Act </li>
  <li>Income from Gaeltacht students </li>
  <li>Grants or allowances from schemes promoting the welfare of blind people
  </li>
  <li>Money received from charitable organisations, for example, St Vincent de
    Paul </li>
  <li>Compensation awarded by the Compensation Tribunal in respect of Hepatitis
    C contracted from certain blood products, to those who have disabilities
    caused by Thalidomide and to those receiving compensation under the
    Residential Institutions Redress Board </li>
  <li><a href="../../../education/third_level_education/fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/maintenance_grant_schemes_for_students_on_third_level_courses.html">Student
    Grants</a></li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../disability_and_illness/domiciliary_care_allowance.html">Domiciliary
    Care Allowance</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../carers/respite_care_grant.html">Carer's Support
    Grant</a> </li>
  <li>Guardian's Payment (Contributory) and Guardian's Payment
    (Non-Contributory) </li>
  <li>Fuel Allowance and the Living Alone Allowance</li>
  <li><strong>Pensioners:</strong> If you are aged 65 or over (or where one of
    a couple is of pensionable age) and have a combined household income
    greater than the rate of SWA appropriate to your household circumstances,
    the difference between the maximum rate of <a shape="rect" href="../older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html">State
    Pension (Contributory)</a> appropriate to your circumstance and the rate of
    SWA appropriate to your circumstances is not taken into account. </li>
  <li><strong>Carers' payments:</strong> The <a shape="rect" href="../carers/half_rate_carers_allowance.html">half-rate Carer's
    Allowance</a> is not taken into account. </li>
  <li>If you are getting <a shape="rect" href="../carers/carers_allowance.html">Carer's Allowance</a>, the amount of
    Carer's Allowance above the appropriate SWA rate for your situation (either
    the qualified adult rate for a couple or the personal rate of SWA) is not
    taken into account. So if you are one of a <strong>couple</strong> and
    getting Carer's Allowance, the amount of Carer's Allowance being paid less
    the SWA qualified adult rate is not taken into account. If you are
    <strong>single or a lone parent</strong> the amount disregarded is the rate
    of Carer's Allowance being paid less the personal rate of SWA. </li>
  <li>Any amount of <a shape="rect" href="../carers/carers_benefit.html">Carer's Benefit</a> in excess of the
    basic SWA rate for your situation (either the qualified adult rate or the
    personal rate of SWA) is not taken into account. </li>
  <li><strong>Rehabilitative earnings disregard</strong>: A certain amount of
    your income from rehabilitative work is not taken into account. If you are
    getting Disability Allowance or Blind Pension, €120 from rehabilitative
    training or employment is not taken into account in the assessment for Rent
    Supplement. Any earnings over €120 from rehabilitative training or
    employment will affect your Rent Supplement. If you are earning above
    €120 you can be assessed using whichever disregard is most in your
    interest - either the <em>Rehabilitative earnings disregard</em> or the
    <em>Additional income disregard</em> (but not both). </li>
  <li><strong>Additional income disregard</strong>: A certain amount of your
    household income from certain sources is not taken into account. €75 of
    any <em>additional household income*</em> above the SWA rate for your
    circumstances is not taken into account. Also, 25% of <em>additional
    household income</em> over €75 is not taken into account. There is no
    upper limit on the amount that can be disregarded. 
    <p><strong>*Additional household income </strong>is income from part-time
    employment or part-time self-employment, Family Income Supplement (FIS),
    Community Employment (CE), the Tús scheme, JobBridge,the Rural Social
    Scheme, Momentum, Part-time Job Incentive Scheme, Skillnets, Work Placement
    Scheme, Gateway, Back to Work Allowance, Back to Work Enterprise Allowance
    or a FET (formerly FÁS) course. Part of a maintenance payment is also
    assessed as additional household income (see below).</p>
  </li>
</ul><p>If you were getting Rent Supplement before 5 June 2007, you can continue to
have your income assessed using the old income disregards, unless the current
income disregards ensure a more favourable assessment. However, if you do not
claim Rent Supplement for more than 13 weeks you will be assessed using the
current income disregards. (See 'Further information' below for more
information on how income was assessed for Rent Supplement before 5 June
2007.)</p>

<h3>Maintenance and Rent Supplement</h3>

<p>Maintenance is assessed as <em>additional household income</em> (see above)
and maintenance payments up to €95.23 per week are assessed in full. The
household income disregard (see above) applies to maintenance payments above
this amount. The reason for this is that the first €95.23 per week of
maintenance payments are considered to be a contribution towards your housing
expenses. </p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> if your only additional household income is
maintenance, all of your maintenance payment up to €95.23 per week is
assessed in full. The household income disregard of €75 applies to sums above
this, so that any maintenance between €95.23 and €170.23 is not taken into
account. 25% of all maintenance over €170.23 is also not taken into
account.</p>

<h3>Your contribution to rent (Household Contribution)</h3>

<p>Once the amount of Rent Supplement you qualify for has been worked out, it
will be reduced by a minimum of €30. This is because you must pay at least
€30 a week towards your rent. You may pay more than €30 because you are
also required to contribute any additional assessable means that you have above
the appropriate basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance rate towards your rent. A
couple claiming Rent Supplement must pay at least €40 a week towards their
rent. </p>

<p>Any non-dependent household members who are solely dependent on a personal
social welfare payment must also contribute €30. However, if <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/how_parents_income_can_affect_jobseekers_allowance.html">benefit
and privilege</a> has been assessed against your social welfare payment you do
not have to contribute €30. If the non-dependent household members are a
couple their contribution is €40. A couple over 65 with an income equal to or
less than the State Pension (Contributory) for their situation will contribute
€40 a week towards their rent. A couple who both have State Pensions
(Contributory) and no other income will also contribute €40 towards their
weekly rent.</p>

<p><strong>Age-related contributions</strong></p>

<p>Since January 2017, people aged 18-24 who are on age-related benefits pay a
lower Household Contribution. The contribution is reduced from €30 to €10
per week for Rent Supplement recipients who are getting Jobseeker’s Allowance
(JA) or Supplementary Welfare Allowance of €100 per week and from €30 to
€20 for those who are getting JA of €144.</p>

<p>For people who are getting BTEA, a Further Education and Training (FET)
training allowance or on Youthreach, where the age-related rate of €160
applies, the Household Contribution is reduced from €30 to €20 a week.</p>

<h3>Calculating Rent Supplement</h3>

<p>Calculating your Rent Supplement can be difficult. The Department of Social
Protection's representative (formerly known as the Community Welfare Officer)
will decide if you are eligible for Rent Supplement and calculate the amount
you will get. <a shape="rect" href="calculating_rent_supplement.html">More
information is available on how to calculate Rent Supplement</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Discrimination when letting residential property</h3>

<p>Equality legislation applies to lettings and accommodation. Landlords cannot
discriminate against potential tenants on grounds of gender, civil status,
family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race or
membership of the Traveller community.</p>

<p>You cannot be discriminated against when renting because you are getting
Rent Supplement, HAP or any other social welfare payment. (This is known as the
“housing assistance” ground.) This means that landlords can no longer state
when advertising accommodation that Rent Supplement (or HAP) is not accepted
and they cannot refuse to rent you accommodation because you are getting a
social welfare payment. If you feel you have been discriminated against by a
landlord or their agent, <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/enforcement_and_redress/equality_tribunal.html">you
can find out more about making a complaint under the Equal Status Acts</a>.</p>

<p></p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Rent Supplement is paid to you weekly or monthly by cheque, Electronic Fund
Transfer or post draft, usually in arrears. </p>

<p>The amount of Rent Supplement that is calculated will generally ensure that
your income, after paying rent, does not fall below a minimum level. This level
is the <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/reference/checklists/checklist_swa_rates_for_rent_supplement.html">basic
Supplementary Welfare Allowance rate for your circumstances</a> minus the
appropriate rate of Household Contribution (see above). However, you may pay
more depending on your means - see 'Rules' above.</p>

<p>The rent paid to your landlord (that is, your contribution plus your Rent
Supplement) should not be above the maximum rent limit set for your county or
area (this provision can be waived in some circumstances). The maximum rent
limit for your county is set by the Department of Social Protection (DSP).
However, the Community Welfare Office may set <strong>lower rates</strong>
within these limits. There is a maximum rent limit for each area (see below).
If your actual rent is higher than the local maximum, you may be refused Rent
Supplement entirely. </p>

<h3>Cases where rent is over the relevant limit</h3>

<p>In some cases Rent Supplement can be paid at the discretion of the DSP staff
administering the scheme where the rent is over the relevant limit:</p>
<ul><li>If you or a member of your household has special housing needs (for
    example, a disabled person in specially adapted accommodation).</li>
  <li>If you will be able to pay the rent yourself within a short period, if,
    for example, if you are taking up employment. In this case Rent Supplement
    at a higher rate can be paid for a short period of 6-8 weeks.</li>
  <li>If you have additional income to pay the balance yourself. (Rent
    Supplement is still based on the maximum rent limit.)</li>
  <li>If there are other exceptional circumstances. (Special provisions apply
    if you are <a href="../../../housing/losing_your_home/homelessness.html">at risk of
    becoming homeless</a>.) Note also that the Community Welfare Service has
    statutory discretionary power to award or increase a Rent Supplement
    payment, for example, when dealing with a person who is in danger of
    homelessness. This applies both to people getting Rent Supplement and to
    new applicants. Tenants living in Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Cork
    City and its environs, Galway, Mayo and Roscommon can access the <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/housing-supports/dublin.html">Tenancy
    Protection Service</a> (TPS) on Freephone 1800 454 454. If you live outside
    of these areas, the TPS can assist you with your Rent Supplement
    application.</li>
</ul><h4>Rent Supplement and lease agreements</h4>

<p>If, when your Rent Supplement claim is reviewed, the rent you pay is above
the relevant limit and your lease is not due for renewal, you will be expected
to re-negotiate your rent with your landlord. If the landlord insists that the
terms of the current lease are not negotiable and does not reduce the rent to
the new limits the DSP representative will discuss your options with you. These
may include seeking other accommodation. If the rent is in line with local
market rates the limits can be exceeded in some cases.</p>

<h3><strong>Rent limits</strong></h3>

<p>You can find <a href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Maximum-Rent-Limits-by-County.aspx">the
rent limits for Rent Supplement on the Department's website</a>. Note that the
Community Welfare Office may set lower rates within these limits. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<p><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2007/en/si/0221.html">SI 221/07</a>
sets down that the maximum amounts of Rent Supplement payable for tenants in
voluntary housing developments (funded through the Capital Assistance Scheme)
are €55 for a single person and €60 for a couple. The minimum Household
Contribution set out above also applies. </p>

<p>If you are currently getting Rent Supplement, there is no automatic increase
to a new rate if the rates increase (as you are currently signed up to a
tenancy agreement with your landlord). The current rate limits will apply when
your existing lease expires or when your claim is reviewed. You can request a
review of your Rent Supplement claim by contacting the office dealing with your
claim.</p>

<p>Tenants living in Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Cork City and its
environs, Galway, Mayo and Roscommon can access the <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/housing-supports/dublin.html">Tenancy Protection
Service</a> operated by Threshold on Freephone 1800 454 454.</p>

<h4>Changes to your circumstances</h4>

<p>If your circumstances change, you may no longer qualify for Rent Supplement
or the amount of your payment may change. Read more about <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/changes_to_rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement and changes to your circumstances</a>. You can also read <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/rent_faq.aspx">FAQs about Rent Supplement
from the Department of Social Protection</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>To apply, fill in an <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/swa_rs1.pdf">application form for Rent
Supplement (pdf).</a> The Department of Social Protection's representative
(formerly known as the Community Welfare Officer) or local Citizens Information
Service can help you fill in this form.</p>

<p>Part of the form will need to be filled in by your landlord or their agent.
Your landlord will need to provide their tax reference number (normally their
PPS number) to the Department of Social Protection (DSP). If your landlord does
not wish to fill in the form <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/swa3c.pdf">a
separate form (SWA 3C) (pdf)</a> is available. If your landlord does not have a
tax reference number, they should state this in writing to the DSP and explain
why this is the case. Your Rent Supplement may not be paid if your landlord has
not given their tax number to the DSP or has not explained why they do not have
one. </p>

<p>Another part of the form may need to be filled in by your local authority,
to confirm you are on their housing list and have a housing need (if you are
not exempt from this rule). </p>

<p>You also need to bring the following documents:</p>
<ul><li>Identity documents for you and your dependants, such as full birth
    certificates, passports, driving licence, work permit, immigration (GNIB)
    card, etc. </li>
  <li>Documents to show your income and financial situation, such as, pay
    slips, P45, P35, P60, bank statements, etc. </li>
  <li>Documents to prove where you live, such as electricity, gas or phone
    bills, etc. </li>
  <li>Documents relating to your tenancy, such as your rent book, lease or
    tenancy agreement. </li>
</ul><p>The Department of Social Protection's representative (formerly known as the
Community Welfare Officer) usually visits you to confirm your circumstances.</p>

<h3>Appealing a decision</h3>

<p>If you are not satisfied with a decision made in relation to Rent
Supplement, you should first find out why the decision was made by asking the
Department of Social Protection's representative (formerly known as the
Community Welfare Officer). You should provide any extra documentation to back
up your case. </p>

<p>If the decision is not changed, then request an appeal form. Include as much
detail as possible in your appeal and keep photocopies of everything. </p>

<p>If your appeal is unsuccessful, you can refer the appeal to the <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_welfare_system_in_ireland.html">Social
Welfare Appeals Office</a>. You may request a personal hearing and you can
bring along a representative to help argue your case.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="lef21f">Where to apply</h2>

<p>To apply for Rent Supplement you should contact the Department of Social
Protection's representative (formerly known as the Community Welfare Officer)
at your <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/otheroffice/community-welfare-office-contact.aspx">local
Intreo or social welfare branch office.</a> However, in some areas new Rent
Supplement applications are processed by centralised Rent Units. To see if your
area is dealt with by a central Rent Unit you can view <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Central-Rents-Units.aspx">the central Rent
Unit list</a>.</p>

<p>If you live in one of these areas you can get a rent pack from your local
office. This pack contains detailed information (including a list of
documentation you will need) and all the relevant application forms. You should
read the information in the pack carefully. If you are satisfied that you have
all the necessary documents ready you can forward your application to the
relevant Rent Unit. The processing of your application may be delayed if you do
not supply all the information requested in the pack. The Unit will contact you
if they need any further information. If they do not need any more information
they will tell you when your application will be processed.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic further_info">
<h2 class="further_info" id="l23f7d">Further information</h2>

<p>A certain amount of your income is not taken into account in the assessment
for Rent Supplement. The income not taken into account is called an <em>income
disregard</em>. The current income disregards came into effect on 5 June
2007.</p>

<p>All existing Rent Supplement claims in payment on 5 June 2007 were reviewed
and assessed using both the current income disregards and the old income
disregards. If you would get more Rent Supplement using the old income
disregards (see below), you continued to be assessed using the old income
disregards until:</p>
<ul><li>You no longer qualify for Rent Supplement or </li>
  <li>You have a break in your claim for more than 13 weeks or </li>
  <li>You have a change in your circumstances. For example, a change of
    address, household income, increase or decrease in rent or a change in your
    social welfare payment. </li>

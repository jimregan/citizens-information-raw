<p>Jobseeker's Benefit is a weekly payment from the Department of Social
Protection (DSP) to people who are out of work and are covered by <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social
insurance (PRSI)</a>. If you don't qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit you may
qualify for <a shape="rect" href="jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
Allowance</a>.</p>

<h3>Intreo - the integrated employment and support service</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Intreo.aspx">Intreo is a service
from the Department of Social Protection</a> which provides a single point of
contact for all employment and income supports. Details of Intreo locations are
published on <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/List-of-Social-Welfare-Local-and-Branch-Offices-by-County.aspx">welfare.ie</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit you must be aged under 66 and:</p>
<ul><li>Be unemployed (you must be fully unemployed or unemployed for at least 4
    days out of 7) </li>
  <li>Have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed
    for at least 4 days out of 7 </li>
  <li>Be capable of work</li>
  <li>Be available for and genuinely seeking work</li>
  <li>Have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions </li>
</ul><p>You can read more about <a href="conditions_for_getting_a_jobseekers_payment.html">the conditions for
getting a jobseeker's payment</a> and about the <a href="employment_supports.html">employment services the Department of Social
Protection offers to jobseekers</a>. There are some exceptions to the rules for
<a href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/pregnancy_and_social_welfare_payments.html">pregnant
women around the time of birth</a>. </p>

<h3>Jobseeker's Benefit and work</h3>

<p>To get Jobseeker's Benefit you must be unemployed or have lost at least one
day's employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7
days. You may continue to get Jobseeker's Benefit if you can only find
part-time or casual work. </p>

<p>Where a Jobseeker's Benefit recipient is working for part of a week, their
entitlement will be based on a 5-day payment week. This means that for each day
that a person is employed, 1/5th of the normal rate of Jobseeker's Benefit is
deducted. If they get part-time work for 2 days, they will get 3/5ths of the
normal Jobseeker's Benefit for that week and if they get part-time work for 3
days they will get 2/5ths of the normal rate of Jobseeker’s Benefit for the
week. You must still be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 to claim
Jobseeker's Benefit. You can read <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/faq_jb_5daychanges.pdf">FAQS about
these changes</a>.</p>

<p>There is an exemption from some of the rules for retained firefighters. More
information is available about <a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_and_work/jobseekers_benefit_and_work.html">work
and Jobseeker’s Benefit</a>.</p>

<p><strong></strong>If you are getting JB you can use a new <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Benefit-of-Work-Ready-Reckoner-Introduction.aspx">Benefit
of Work Ready Reckoner</a> from the Department of Social Protection to help you
assess out the financial consequences of taking up full-time work. The Reckoner
works out the total amount you would receive on taking up full-time work
(including any Family Income Supplement) and compares this to your jobseeker's
payment (including Rent Supplement).</p>

<h3>Loss of employment</h3>

<p>You must have suffered a substantial loss of employment in any period of 7
consecutive days to be eligible for Jobseeker's Benefit (casual workers and
retained firefighters with no other employment are exempt from this rule). This
means that you must have lost at least one day's employment and as a result of
this loss be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7. Your earnings must also
have been reduced because of the loss of employment. </p>

<h2>Social insurance (PRSI) contributions </h2>

<p>To qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit, you must pay Class A, H or P PRSI
contributions. Class A is the one paid by most private sector employees. Class
H is paid by soldiers, reservists and temporary army nurses, who do not qualify
for Jobseeker's Benefit until they have left the army. To qualify you need:</p>
<ul><li>At least 104 weeks PRSI paid since you first started work </li>
</ul><p><strong>And</strong></p>
<ul><li>39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year (a minimum of 13
    weeks must be paid contributions<strong>*</strong>) </li>
</ul><p><strong>Or</strong></p>
<ul><li>26 weeks PRSI paid in the relevant tax year and 26 weeks PRSI paid in the
    tax year immediately before the relevant tax year. </li>
</ul><p><strong>*</strong>If you do not have 13 paid contributions in the relevant
tax year, you must have paid 13 contributions in any of the following years:</p>
<ul><li>The 2 tax years before the relevant tax year </li>
  <li>The last complete tax year </li>
  <li>The current tax year. </li>
</ul><p>The relevant tax year is the second last complete tax year before the year
in which your claim is made. So, for claims made in 2017, the relevant tax year
is 2015.</p>

<p>There are a number of circumstances in which you can be awarded <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">credited
contributions</a>. For example, pre-entry credits are given when you start
employment for the first time in your working life. However, you can only
qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit when you have actually paid 104 contributions.
Credits are also awarded while you are getting certain social welfare payments,
including Jobseeker's Benefit (provided it is for 6 days), <a shape="rect" href="../disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">Illness Benefit</a>
and, in some cases, Jobseeker's Allowance.</p>

<p>Contributions you have paid in other <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Jobseekers-Benefit.aspx#part10">member
states of the EU/EEA</a> will be added to your Irish contributions. If you are
applying for Jobseeker's Benefit and need the contributions paid in another
EU/EEA country to help you qualify, then your last contribution must have been
in Ireland.</p>

<p>Under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 employers are obliged to
register all employees for PRSI. Read more in our document on your <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/employer_s_duty_to_pay_social_insurance_prsi.html">Employer's
duty to pay social insurance</a>.</p>

<h2>Disqualification </h2>

<p>You may be disqualified from getting Jobseeker's Benefit for 9 weeks if
you:</p>
<ul><li>Left work voluntarily and without a reasonable cause </li>
  <li>Lost your job through misconduct </li>
  <li>Refused an offer of suitable alternative employment or suitable training
    - if you have been on a penalty rate of JB for at least 21 days</li>
  <li>Are aged under 55 and get a redundancy payment of more than €50,000.
    The exact length of your disqualification (up to 9 weeks) will depend on
    the amount of redundancy payment you received. </li>
</ul><h3>Redundancy</h3>

<p>If you are aged under 55 and get a redundancy payment of more than €50,000
you are disqualified from claiming Jobseeker's Benefit. The table below shows
how long you may be disqualified for. The length of the disqualification is at
the discretion of the deciding officer (who can take your circumstances into
account). Any period of disqualification is subtracted from your total
Jobseeker's Benefit entitlement. So if you are disqualified for 3 weeks (which
is 18 days payment) your JB claim starts on day 19. Note that people who take
voluntary redundancy and do not get a redundancy payment of over €50,000 can
claim jobseeker's payments immediately. </p>

<p>Jobseeker's Benefit is paid for 9 months (234 days) for people with 260 or
more PRSI contributions paid. It is paid for 6 months (156 days) for people
with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid.</p>

<p><a href="older_jobseekers.html">There are some special provisions for
older jobseekers.</a> People over 65 who are claiming Jobseeker’s Benefit
(JB), and who have at least 156 PRSI contributions, can <strong>continue to
receive JB until their 66th birthday</strong> even if their claim is due to end
before that date. </p>

<h3>Re-qualifying for Jobseeker's Benefit</h3>

<p>You can re-qualify for JB if:</p>
<ul><li>You have used up your full JB entitlement (either 9 or 6 months) 
    <p>and</p>
  </li>
  <li>You have paid 13 PRSI contributions for at least 13 weeks (these
    contributions can be counted only after you have claimed at least 156 days
    (6 months) of JB)</li>
</ul><p>However if you are working and claiming JB (systematic short-time workers
and part-time workers) you cannot simply continue your JB claim when it is
exhausted since you must have suffered a substantial loss of employment to
re-qualify for JB, (unless you are a casual worker). </p>

<p>If you have lost your job you will have suffered a substantial loss of
employment. If you are a part-time or systematic short-time worker DSP will
look at your pattern of employment over the last 13 weeks or another
representative period to find out whether you have suffered a substantial loss
of employment. </p>

<p>For example, if you are getting JB and working 3 days each week as a
systematic short-time worker or a part-time worker and your employment pattern
has not changed during the course of your JB claim, you will not have suffered
a substantial loss of employment and will not re-qualify for Jobseeker’s
Benefit when you exhaust your claim. However, if your JB claim ends and your 3
day week working week is then reduced to a 2 day week, you will have suffered a
substantial loss of employment and may re-qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit.</p>

<h3>Linking claims</h3>

<p>If you claim JB for a period, sign off and then claim JB again within 26
weeks your claim may be <em>linked</em> to the earlier claim. This means that
your claim is not treated as a new claim and:</p>
<ul><li>You do not have to wait for 3 days before getting your payment</li>
  <li>The cumulative total of days from the previous claim is continued (so,
    for example, if you have used up 100 days of your total JB entitlement of
    234 days you have 134 days remaining on your claim)</li>
  <li>The rate of JB is the same rate payable as on the previous claim, unless
    there has been a budgetary increase or change in family circumstances (such
    as a new child dependant).</li>
</ul><p>If your JB claim does not link to a previous claim it is treated as a new
claim. You must wait for 3 days before getting a payment and your cumulative
total of days starts from the first day of payment.</p>

<p>You can read more about <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Jobseekers-Benefit.aspx#part6">linking
claims</a> including information on linking to a different scheme (such as
Illness Benefit) and linking to an earlier JB claim through a different scheme
or period spent in training or on an employment scheme.</p>

<h3>Short-term employment or training</h3>

<p>The Department of Social Protection operates a fast-tracking system for
people who sign off to take up work for a short period (up to 12 weeks) or to
go on a short training course (up to 12 weeks). This ensures that your payment
is re-instated without delay. It is important that you inform your Intreo
Centre or local Social Welfare Branch Office in advance that you are taking up
work or training. Your <a href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a> claim can also be suspended for up to 12 weeks.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Jobseeker's Benefit is not paid for the first 3 days you are unemployed (the
first 3 days are any 3 days, not necessarily consecutive, in a period of 7
consecutive days). </p>

<p>If you are unemployed for a second time within 26 weeks of your last JB
payment your application for Jobseeker's Benefit is not treated as a new claim
and you do <strong>not</strong> have another 3 days of non-payment. See
'Linking claims' above. </p>

<p>You get a personal rate and may get an increase for an <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">adult
dependant</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_and_increase_in_your_payment_for_a_child_dependant.html">child
dependant</a> (see below). Your average weekly earnings do not affect the
amount you get for a child dependent.</p>

<p><strong>Average weekly earnings</strong></p>

<p>Jobseeker's Benefit rates are graduated according to your earnings in the
relevant tax year. Your average weekly earnings are your gross yearly earnings
from employment divided by the number of paid A, H or P contributions in the
<em>relevant tax year</em>. </p>

<p>The relevant tax year is 2 years before the year of your claim. For example,
if you claim Jobseeker's Benefit in 2017 the relevant tax year is 2015. If you
only qualify for a reduced JB payment, it may of greater benefit for you to
claim <a shape="rect" href="jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
Allowance</a> instead of Jobseeker's Benefit.</p>

<h4>Penalty rates</h4>

<p>Your payment can be reduced if you refuse or fail to attend meetings
requested by the Department or if you refuse or fail to participate in an
appropriate employment support scheme, work experience or training. You can
find out about <a href="conditions_for_getting_a_jobseekers_payment.html">sanctions for not
meeting the conditions of your jobseeker's payment.</a> Since 1 January 2014,
penalty rates do not apply to people aged over 62. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Claiming for dependants with Jobseeker's Benefit</h3>

<p>If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is dependent on you or is on a
low income you may be able to claim an increase in your payment for him or her.
This increase is called an Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA). If your adult
dependant is earning €100 or less you will get the maximum IQA. If he or she
is earning between €100 and €310 you will get a reduced rate of IQA. If
your adult dependant is earning more than €310 you will not get an increase
in your Jobseeker’s Benefit for your adult dependant.</p>

<p>You can look at our documents on <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">Claiming

children</a> you may also be able to claim an increase in your payment for
them.</p>

<h3>Taxation of Jobseeker's Benefit</h3>

<p><a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">Jobseeker's
Benefit is taxable</a>. However, if you are getting Jobseeker's Benefit because
your normal working week has been reduced temporarily (systematic short-time
work) your Jobseeker's Benefit is not taxed. If you are working part-time and
getting Jobseeker’s Benefit for the days you are not employed your
Jobseeker’s Benefit <em>is</em> taxable. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it24.html">Find out more about
the taxation of Jobseeker's Benefit and the taxation of JB for systematic
short-time workers.</a></p>

<p>If you are getting Jobseeker's Benefit, you may be entitled to:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
    Supplement</a> - a payment under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance

<h3>Half-rate Jobseeker's Benefit with another social welfare payment</h3>

<p>People getting a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Pension, a
One-Parent Family Payment or a deserted wives payment and who met all the
conditions for Jobseeker's Benefit, were entitled to half the normal rate of
Jobseeker's Benefit. <strong>These half-rate payments were discontinued from
February 2012. </strong></p>

<h3>Changes to duration of Jobseeker's Benefit</h3>

<p>The duration of Jobseeker's Benefit reduced by 3 months <strong>with effect
from 3 April 2013</strong>. For people with 260 or more PRSI contributions
paid, it reduced from 12 months (312 days) to 9 months (234 days). For people
with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid, it reduced from 9 months (234
days) to 6 months (156 days). Claimants getting Jobseeker's Benefit for 6
months or more on 3 April 2013 (or 3 months for people with fewer than 260
contributions) were not affected (see table below).</p>

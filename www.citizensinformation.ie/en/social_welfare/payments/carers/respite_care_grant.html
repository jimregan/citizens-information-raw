<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Carer's Support Grant is an annual payment made to carers by the
Department of Social Protection. The scheme name was changed in 2016 to better
reflect how the Grant is used by carers. It was formerly called the Respite
Care Grant. Carers can use the grant in whatever way they wish. You can use the
grant to pay for respite care if you wish, but you do not have to do so. More
information about <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/health_services_for_people_with_disabilities/respite_care.html">respite
care facilities</a> is available.</p>

<p>In June of each year (usually on the first Thursday of the month), the
Department of Social Protection pays the grant automatically to carers getting
<a shape="rect" href="carers_allowance.html">Carer's Allowance</a>, <a shape="rect" href="carers_benefit.html">Carer's Benefit</a>, or <a href="../disability_and_illness/domiciliary_care_allowance.html">Domiciliary
Care Allowance</a> from the Department. Only one Carer's Support Grant can be
paid for each person getting care.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>A Carer's Support Grant of â‚¬1,700 (June 2017) is paid once each year,
usually on the first Thursday in June, for each person you are caring for. It
is not taxable.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you are getting Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit or Domiciliary Care
Allowance from the Department of Social Protection, you do not need to apply
for the Carer's Support Grant. It will be automatically paid to you in June.
</p>

<p>If you are not getting any of these payments you should fill in an <a shape="rect" href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/CSG1.pdf">application form CSG
1 (pdf)</a> in respect of each person you are caring for.</p>

<p>If you were not getting one of the above payments in 2016, but still got the
Carer's Support Grant, you do not need to reapply for 2017. If you got the
grant in 2016, you will have received a letter in April 2017 from the Carer's
Support Grant section in the Department of Social Protection, together with a
short 2-page questionnaire. You must answer the questions on the questionnaire
and return it to the Carer's Support Grant section. After you return the
questionnaire, the Department will use this and the information on file to
reassess you for the Carer's Support Grant. </p>

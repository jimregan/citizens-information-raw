<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If your circumstances change while you are getting <a href="rent_supplement.html">Rent Supplement</a> you may have your payment
reduced or you may no longer be eligible for it. The amount of Rent Supplement
you get depends on various factors – including your income, savings,
earnings, household composition and the current local rent limits. </p>

<p>Your <a href="calculating_rent_supplement.html">Rent Supplement payment
is calculated</a> to ensure that your income is not less than the <a href="../../../reference/checklists/checklist_swa_rates_for_rent_supplement.html">basic
Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) rate for your circumstances</a> (for
example, €186 for a single person over 25 and €310.80 for a couple) minus a
minimum contribution of €30 (or €40 for a couple). If your income increases
above this amount, your Rent Supplement payment may be reduced. </p>

<p>Your Rent Supplement claim is reviewed regularly (generally every 6 months).
When your claim is reviewed you will be asked to fill out a Rent Supplement
Review Form. You should return the form as soon as possible to the officer
dealing with your claim to make sure that there is no delay to your payment.
</p>

<p>You should always tell the Department of Social Protection (DSP) immediately
(see ‘How to apply’ below) if there are any changes to your means. You
should also inform the DSP if there are changes to the means of other members
of your household, or to the number of people living in your household. </p>

<p>This document outlines what happens to your Rent Supplement payment in some
common situations. </p>

<p>A new <a href="../../../housing/renting_a_home/housing_assistance_payment.html">Housing
Assistance Payment (HAP)</a> has been introduced in some areas. <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/SWA---Rent-Supplement.aspx">Different
rules apply for Rent Supplement</a> depending on whether you live in an area
where the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is in operation or in an area
where HAP is not yet in operation. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l89b94">Changes to your means</h2>

<h3>If you or your partner gets full-time work:</h3>

<p>In general people working full-time (defined as 30 hours or over a week) are
not eligible for Rent Supplement. Claims from self-employed people are assessed
on the individual circumstances of the case and you may be asked to show that
you are working less than 30 hours a week.</p>

<p>If you get full-time work and you have been accepted as being in need of
accommodation under the <a href="../../../housing/local_authority_and_social_housing/rental_accommodation_scheme.html">Rental
Accommodation Scheme (RAS)</a> by your local authority, you may be able to keep
your Rent Supplement (provided you have been unemployed or not in full-time
employment for at least 12 months before you start work). If you are working
over 30 hours a week in self-employment or if you are getting the Back to Work
Enterprise Allowance you must be deemed eligible for the RAS scheme by your
local authority to continue to get Rent Supplement. </p>

<p>However, you will be reassessed for Rent Supplement and your income from
work will be taken into account. As a result of the reassessment you may or may
not continue to qualify for Rent Supplement. If you do qualify for Rent
Supplement you may get a different rate of Supplement. The additional household
income disregard (see below) applies to income from work.</p>

<p>Many people on long-term Rent Supplement are being transferred to the new <a href="../../../housing/renting_a_home/housing_assistance_payment.html">Housing
Assistance Payment (HAP)</a>. You can work full-time and continue to receive
HAP. However HAP is not yet in operation nationwide. </p>

<p>If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant gets full-time work your
household is no longer eligible for Rent Supplement. (Note that a non-dependent
household member can work full-time but they must make a minimum contribution
to the rent - see 'If your family circumstances or size changes' below.)</p>

<p>If you get full-time work and you are not entitled to retain your Rent
Supplement you can continue to get Rent Supplement for up to 30 days after
starting work or until you are paid, whichever is earlier.</p>

<h3>If you get part-time work:</h3>

<p>If you get part-time work (defined as less than 30 hours a week) you can
keep your Rent Supplement but your income from work will be assessed against
your Rent Supplement and it may be reduced. The additional household income
disregard (see below) applies to income from part-time work.</p>

<p>The same applies to your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant - any income
he/she gets from part-time work will be assessed against your Rent Supplement
and the Supplement may be reduced.</p>

<table border="1"><caption></caption>
  <col><tbody><tr><td><h4 style="text-align:center;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">Additional
        household income disregard</h4>

        <p>Some income from part-time employment and other sources is not taken
        into account in the means test for Rent Supplement. <em>Additional
        household income</em> is income from employment or self-employment,
        Family Income Supplement, Community Employment, JobBridge, the Tús
        scheme, the Rural Social Scheme, Gateway, the Part-time Job Incentive
        Scheme, Work Placement Scheme, Back to Work Allowance, Back to Work
        Enterprise Allowance or an approved FET course. It also includes income
        above the SWA rate for those on Momentum courses or the Skillnets
        programme.</p>

        <p>Under the additional household income disregard the first €75 per
        week of additional household income above the SWA rate for your
        circumstances is not taken into account and 25% of additional household
        income over €75 per week is not taken into account. There is no upper
        limit on the amount that can be disregarded. A portion of maintenance
        payments is assessed as additional household income. The first €95.23
        per week of maintenance payments is assessable in full and any amount
        above this is assessed under the additional household income disregard.
        You can use our document on <a href="calculating_rent_supplement.html">Calculating Rent
        Supplement</a> to work out your additional household income
        disregard.</p>

        <p>If you are getting Disability Allowance or Blind Pension and do <a href="../social_welfare_payments_and_work/disability_payments_and_work.html">rehabilitative
        work</a>, up to €120 per week of earnings from this employment can be
        disregarded. However, this disregard cannot be applied together with
        the additional household income disregard. Only one disregard can be
        applied, whichever is most beneficial.</p>
      </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><h3>If you change from one social welfare payment to another:</h3>

<p>There is no change to your Rent Supplement payment if the amount you get
stays the same. If your social welfare payment is suspended, pending
investigation, your Rent Supplement can be stopped.</p>

<p>However in some circumstances your Rent Supplement payment may be affected.
If you transfer onto a different and higher payment your Rent Supplement will
be reduced in line with the increase (unless you are aged 65 or over or are
getting a carer’s payment – see below). For example, a person getting <a href="../disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">Illness Benefit</a>
who transfers onto <a href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/maternity_benefit.html">Maternity
Benefit</a> at a higher rate may have their Rent Supplement reduced by the
difference between the two payments.</p>

<p><strong>If you are aged 65 or over</strong> (or where one of a couple is of
pensionable age) and have a combined household income greater than the SWA rate
for your circumstances, the difference between the maximum rate of <a href="../older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html">State
Pension (Contributory)</a> for your circumstances and the <a href="supplementary_welfare_allow.html">basic Supplementary Welfare
Allowance (SWA)</a> rate for your circumstances is not taken into account. For
example, a couple who are both aged 66 and getting State (Non-Contributory)
pensions would get a payment of €438. However their Over 65 disregard is
calculated on 2 State Pension (Contributory) rates. So their disregard is
worked out by subtracting the basic SWA rate for a couple (€310.80) from
€460.60. The difference of €149.80 is not taken into account but any income
the couple has above this might affect their Rent Supplement payment. </p>

<p><strong>A carer's disregard</strong> applies to people getting carer’s
payments. So if you are getting Carer's Allowance or Carer’s Benefit, the
amount of the actual carer’s payment above the appropriate SWA rate for your
situation (either the SWA qualified adult rate if one of a couple is getting
Carer's Allowance or the personal rate of SWA if the carer is single) is not
taken into account. Half-rate Carer’s Allowance is never taken into
account.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>If you go onto an employment scheme:</h3>

<p>If you were getting Rent Supplement before you started the <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/schemes_to_support_employment.html">employment
scheme (sometimes called a back-to-work scheme)</a> you can generally keep your
Rent Supplement but income from the scheme may be assessed and your Rent
Supplement may be reduced. <em></em></p>

<p>The following table summarises how income from various schemes is
treated.</p>

<h3>If you go back to education: </h3>

<p>In most cases, people in full-time education are not eligible for Rent
Supplement. Your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant can be in full-time
education while you are getting Rent Supplement.</p>

<p>If you are getting a <a href="../back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">Back to
Education Allowance</a> or taking part in a full-time <a href="../../../education/vocational_education_and_training/training_and_apprentiship_programmes/courses_for_long_term_unemployed_people.html">Momentum
project</a> or a <a href="../../../education/third_level_education/applying_to_college/third_level_places_for_unemployed_people.html">Springboard
course</a>, you can retain your Rent Supplement. <ins></ins></p>

<p>Some people can return to education and retain their Disability Allowance or
One-Parent Family Payment but they will lose their Rent Supplement because they
are in full-time education. </p>

<p>If you are on an approved <a href="../../../education/vocational_education_and_training/fas_training_programmes_and_supports/fas_training_courses.html">FET
(previously FÁS) course</a> you can retain or apply for Rent Supplement. If
you are participating in an approved training course, any lunch or travel
allowances paid may be disregarded.</p>

<p>You can apply for or keep Rent Supplement while on a <a href="../../../education/returning_to_education/vocational_training_opportunities_scheme.html">Vocational
Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS)</a> or <a href="../../../education/vocational_education_and_training/youthreach.html">Youthreach</a>.
</p>

<h3>If you inherit or are given money: </h3>

<p>The income limits for the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme (under
which Rent Supplement is paid) are lower than those for other social welfare
payments. If, for example, you inherit €15,000 this may have no effect on
your main payment (because you can have up to €20,000 capital for the
majority of <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/means_test.html">means-tested
social welfare payments</a> and €50,000 for Disability Allowance) but it may
affect your Rent Supplement (because any capital over €5,000 is assessed).</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l47224">Changes to the number of people in the
household </h2>

<h3>If your family circumstances or size changes:</h3>

<p>Every non-dependent adult household member is expected to pay a minimum
contribution to the rent of €30. Custom and practice is that the assessable
income of the non-dependent household member (that is, gross income less PRSI
and travel costs to work) is divided by the appropriate rate of SWA for their
situation which is then multiplied by €30 to establish how much they should
contribute to the household's rent. </p>

<p>If the non-dependent household members are a couple their contribution is
€40. (A non-dependent household member is anyone who is not your spouse,
civil partner or cohabitant who is working or getting a social welfare payment
in their own right.)</p>

<p>When your child/children turns 18, if they are still in full-time education,
there will be no change to your Rent Supplement. If a child living in the
household turns 18 and gets a job or a social welfare payment in their own
right they are expected to pay a minimum contribution of €30. However, if <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/how_parents_income_can_affect_supplementary_welfare_allowance.html">benefit
and privilege</a> has been assessed against their social welfare payment they
do not have to contribute €30.</p>

<p>If a child leaves home your rent must be under the limit for your reduced
family size. (The Rent Supplement limits vary depending on where you live. You
will need to know what the limits are in your local area.)</p>

<p>If you have a new baby or if you adopt or foster a child your family size
will increase so the rent limit that applies to your household may increase. If
you have a large family and you need larger accommodation that costs more than
the rent limits that apply in your area you should discuss your situation with
your local DSP representative - see ‘How to apply’ below.</p>

<h3>If you marry, enter a civil partnership or start to live with a new
partner:</h3>

<p>If someone comes to live with you as a spouse, civil partner or cohabitant
you will be treated as a couple and you will be expected to pay a minimum
household contribution of €40 towards your rent. You do not have to make a
new application for Rent Supplement. However your existing claim will be
reviewed and any income your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant has from work
or from a social welfare payment will be taken into account. If the person is
working full-time you will no longer be entitled to Rent Supplement.</p>

<h3>If you separate from your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant:</h3>

<p>If your spouse or partner leaves the family home and you remain there with
your children, your Rent Supplement payment does not change (because the rent
limits for a one-parent family and a couple with children are the same).
However if your partner has custody of your child(ren) for most of the time,
the rent limits applied for the family size can change (because the child(ren)
are no longer in the home full time).</p>

<p>If you do not have children and your partner leaves you will be assessed as
a single person for Rent Supplement.</p>

<p>If your former spouse or partner pays maintenance some of this will be
assessed in the means test for Rent Supplement. The first €95.23 per week of
maintenance payments is assessable in full (because it is considered to be a
contribution towards your housing expenses) and any amount above this is
assessed under the additional household income disregard - see ‘Additional
household income disregard’ above.</p>

<p>If you own your home as joint owners and the person who leaves the family
home applies for Rent Supplement they may be refused because they are
considered to have an interest in the home. However, once there is a separation
agreement in place and the home ownership issues have been resolved the person
who left should be able to apply for Rent Supplement in their own right. They
will need to have their housing need assessed by the local authority in the
usual way.</p>

<h3>If your children spend some time with one parent and some time with
another:</h3>

<p>If you have shared custody or guardianship of a child and that child stays
with you overnight for part of the week, you should check with your local
Department of Social Protection representative (formerly known as the Community
Welfare Officer or CWO). Each Rent Supplement claim is examined with regard to
all of the circumstances of the case.</p>

<p>If you are not the primary carer and are looking for accommodation to
provide for your children the DSP will take the following into consideration
when processing your Rent Supplement claim:</p>
<ul><li>Your family composition and size</li>
  <li>Whether any court orders or agreements exist indicating whether joint
    custody arrangements or access arrangements are in place</li>
  <li>Where you live in relation to the primary carer</li>
  <li>Whether the child is living with you temporarily as part of an access
    agreement</li>
  <li>Any evidence of a history of continued parental support for the child
    such as transfer of property to the primary carer, evidence of financial
    support and other supports such as attending parent-teacher meetings and
    collecting child from school</li>
  <li>Any evidence indicating whether you availed of overnight access to the
    child(ren) before your application for Rent Supplement</li>
  <li>Any evidence from any social worker or medical reports</li>
  <li>Whether any letters of consent from the primary carer exist or are
    required</li>
  <li>The content of any Housing Needs Assessment from your local authority</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="ldc2ec">Other changes to your circumstances</h2>

<h3>If your landlord raises the rent:</h3>

<p>Rent Supplement is not normally paid where the rent payable to the landlord
is over the limits. However, under certain circumstances the Department's
representative can pay Rent Supplement where the rent is above the relevant
limit; this might apply where there are special housing needs or on a very
short-term basis until the tenant is in a position to reassume responsibility
for his/her rent. </p>

<p>In some parts of Ireland rents have risen since the limits were last
revised. The Community Welfare Service has statutory discretionary power to
award or increase a Rent Supplement payment, for example, when dealing with a
person who is in danger of homelessness. This applies both to people getting
Rent Supplement and new applicants. Tenants in Dublin can access the <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/housing-supports/dublin.html">Tenancy Protection
Service provided by Threshold</a> on 1800 454 454.</p>

<h3>If you have to leave your current accommodation:</h3>

<p>If there is a good reason why you have to leave your current accommodation
(for example, your landlord is not willing to renew your lease), you can make
an application for Rent Supplement for a new address, provided it is still
within the rent limits.</p>

<p>However, you will have to apply again and fill out new application forms for
yourself and your new landlord. There may be a gap in payment while your new
application is processed.</p>

<p>If you qualified for Rent Supplement based on housing need (that is, you are
on a local authority housing list) and you are moving to a new local authority
area, you will have to make a fresh application with the new local
authority.</p>

<p><a href="../../../housing/losing_your_home/homelessness.html">Special
provisions apply if you are at risk of becoming homeless.</a></p>

<h3>If you go to hospital or prison:</h3>

<p>If you go to hospital for a short stay, or if you are in prison or remanded
in custody for less than 13 weeks, you can continue to get your Rent
Supplement. If the period is longer than 13 weeks, you may no longer qualify or
your family’s payment may be amended.</p>

<h3>If you get an offer of housing from a local authority:</h3>

<p>If you refuse two offers of social housing from a local authority within a
12-month period, your Rent Supplement will be stopped and you will not be
allowed to claim Rent Supplement for 12 months.</p>

<p>If you have been flooded you may be able to get financial help from the
Department of Social Protection’s Humanitarian Assistance Scheme. The
means-tested scheme provides emergency financial assistance to households who
are not able to meet costs for essential needs immediately following flooding.
The scheme aims to provide financial support to people who have suffered damage
to their home. It is designed to alleviate hardship rather than provide full
compensation for damage.</p>

<p>Two new leaflets are available for people who have been affected by
flooding:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.redcross.ie/emergency-humanitarian-flooding-assistance/">There
is a separate emergency scheme to help small businesses administered by the
Irish Red Cross.</a></p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you have been affected by flooding and meet a means test you may be
eligible. </p>

<h3>What is covered by the scheme?</h3>

<p>1. Emergency income support payments.</p>

<p>2. Damage to your home and its essential contents, such as:</p>
<ul><li>Carpets</li>
  <li>Flooring</li>
  <li>Furniture</li>
  <li>Household appliances and bedding.</li>
</ul><p>3. Structural damage may also be considered.</p>

<h3>What is not covered under the scheme?</h3>
<ul><li>Commercial and business losses</li>
  <li>Losses covered by an insurance policy</li>
  <li>Loss or damage to private rented accommodation or local authority
    accommodation</li>
</ul><h3>Income test</h3>

<p>The income test determines your household’s ability to meet the costs of
restoring your home to a habitable condition. All household income will be
considered.</p>

<p><strong>Single people:</strong> If you have a gross household income of
€30,000 or less you will get 100% of the amount allowable. For each whole
€1,000 of household income above €30,000 you will be required to make a 1%
contribution to the amount allowable.</p>

<p>For example if you are single and have a gross household income of €35,000
you will get 95% of the amount allowable (€5,000 over the income limit of
€30,000 = 5% personal contribution towards the loss).</p>

<p><strong>Couples:</strong> If you are married, in a civil partnership or
cohabiting and have a household income of €50,000 or less you will get 100%
of the amount allowable. For each whole €1,000 of household income above
€50,000 you will be required to make a 1% contribution to the amount
allowable.</p>

<p><strong>Children:</strong> The income limits are increased by €10,000 for
each qualified child.</p>

<p><strong>One-parent household: </strong>The income limits that apply to
couples also apply to one-parent households - €50,000 plus €10,000 for each
dependent child.</p>

<p><strong>Non-dependent adult household members:</strong> For each
non-dependent adult member of the household 20% of their gross income is added
to the household income.</p>

<p>For example, a couple with a gross income of €45,000 with a non-dependent
adult in the house with an income of €20,000 will receive 100% of the amount
allowable as the household income is less than €50,000 (€45,000 + €4,000
[€20,000 x 20%] = €49,000).</p>

<p><strong>People who opted not to insure:</strong> If you had no insurance and
you do not have reasonable grounds for not having insurance, you will be
expected to contribute the first €2,000 toward the amount allowable and your
personal contribution will be 2% for each whole €1,000 above the appropriate
income level for your household.</p>

<h3>How much can be paid to individual applicants?</h3>

<p>Levels of payment will depend on the relative severity of damage experienced
and your ability to meet these costs.</p>

<p>Where structural work is an issue, the Department may get advice from a loss
adjustor.</p>

<p>In assessing cases for humanitarian assistance, account will be taken of <a href="exceptional_needs_payments.html">Exceptional Needs Payments and Urgent
Needs Payments</a> already paid out.</p>

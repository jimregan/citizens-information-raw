<p>Urgent Needs Payments are payments under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance
Scheme. You do not have to meet <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">the
habitual residence condition</a> to qualify for an urgent needs payment.</p>

<p>An Urgent Needs Payment may be paid to people in emergency situations. For
example, in the case of a fire, flood or other disaster, you may get a payment
to help with the immediate cost of food and clothing. Depending on your
circumstances, for example, if you are working or when an insurance claim has
been settled, you may have to pay some or all of this back at a later date. </p>

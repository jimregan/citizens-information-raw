<p>The Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme consists of a basic payment,
called Supplementary Welfare Allowance, and other financial supplements for
certain expenses you may not be able to meet, including emergency situations.
It is administered by <a href="community_welfare_officers.html">the
Department of Social Protection's representative (formerly known as the
Community Welfare Officer)</a> in your <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/otheroffice/community-welfare-office-contact.aspx">local
office</a>.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Basic Supplementary
Welfare Allowance</a> (SWA) is a weekly payment for people that have
insufficient means or no income. For example, SWA can be paid to you while the
Department of Social Protection is processing your claim for another payment.
If you are in hospital for a temporary stay and do not qualify for any other
payment, you may be paid a small amount for your daily personal needs (for
example, newspapers and toiletries). This payment (known as Hospital Comforts)
is paid as a basic SWA payment and is means tested).</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="rent_supplement.html">Rent Supplement</a> is a payment
to help with the cost of rent for people living in privately rented
accommodation. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="mortgage_interest_supplement.html">Mortgage Interest
Supplement</a> is a payment to help with the cost of mortgage interest
repayments. <strong>From 1 January 2014, the Mortgage Interest Supplement
scheme is closed to new entrants and no new applications will be accepted from
this date.</strong> This measure does not affect current claimants immediately
(people who were getting Mortgage Interest Supplement before 1 January 2014).
The scheme will be wound down for existing claimants over a 4-year period.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/back_to_school_clothing_and_footwear_allowance.html">Back
to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance</a> is a payment to help with the
cost of uniforms and footwear for children at school.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="diet_and_heating_supplements.html">Diet Supplement</a>
is a payment to help with the cost of a special diet prescribed by your doctor
or hospital consultant (it is no longer paid to new customers).</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="diet_and_heating_supplements.html">Heating
Supplement</a> is a payment to help people who have extra heating needs with
the cost of heating their home. For example, people that are ill or have a
disability. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="exceptional_needs_payments.html">Exceptional Needs
Payment</a> is a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional
expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of
their weekly income. For example, the payments can be for special clothing for
a person who has a serious illness, bedding or cooking utensils for someone
setting up a home for the first time or costs in relation to funerals.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/urgent_needs_payments.html">Urgent
Needs Payment</a> is a payment to people in emergency situations. For example,
in the case of a fire or flood, you may get a payment to help with the
immediate cost of food and clothing.</p>

<h3>Appealing a decision</h3>

<p>If you are unhappy with the decision of a Departmentâ€™s representative on
your SWA application, you can appeal the decision to the <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_welfare_appeals.html">independent
Social Welfare Appeals Office</a>. The Social Welfare Appeals Office deals with
appeals relating to basic SWA and some SWA supplements but does not decide on
appeals relating to Exceptional or Urgent Needs Payments or Heating
Supplements. You can ask for decisions on these payments to be reviewed by the
SWA Reviewing Officer within the Community Welfare Service.</p>

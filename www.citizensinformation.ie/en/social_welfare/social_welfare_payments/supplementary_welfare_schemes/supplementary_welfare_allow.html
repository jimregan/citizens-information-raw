<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance is a weekly allowance paid to people
who do not have enough income to meet their needs and those of their
families.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you have no income, you may be entitled to the basic Supplementary
Welfare Allowance. If your weekly income is below the Supplementary Welfare
Allowance rate for your family size, a payment may be made to bring your income
up to the appropriate Supplementary Welfare Allowance rate. </p>

<p>If you have claimed a social welfare benefit or pension but it has not yet
been paid and you have no other income, you may qualify for basic Supplementary
Welfare Allowance while you are waiting for your payment. </p>

<p>If you have returned to work you can claim the basic Supplementary Welfare
Allowance for up to 30 days while you are waiting for your wages. </p>

<p>Supplementary Welfare Allowance is not a <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">taxable
source of income</a>. </p>

<h3>Conditions</h3>

<p>You will normally qualify for Supplementary Welfare Allowance if you satisfy
the following conditions:</p>
<ul><li>You are living in the State.</li>
  <li>You satisfy the means test.</li>
  <li>You have applied for any other benefit or allowance you may be entitled
    to. </li>
  <li>You have registered for work with your local Intreo Centre if you are of
    working age. </li>
  <li>You satisfy the <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitual
    residence condition</a>. </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/migrant_workers/coming_from_eu_to_work.html">EU/EEA</a>
    and Swiss migrant workers who have been working in Ireland can access basic
    SWA and supplements without having <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitual
    residence assessed</a>, provided they have the right to reside in Ireland.
    However, people from the EU/EEA or Switzerland who move to Ireland in
    search of employment are subject to the habitual residence test in the
    normal way while looking for work. </li>
</ul><p>You will <em>not</em> normally qualify for basic Supplementary Welfare
Allowance if you are:</p>
<ul><li>In full-time work, that is, working for more than 30 hours per week*.
  </li>
  <li>In full-time education. </li>
  <li>Involved in a trade dispute. However, you may claim Supplementary Welfare
    Allowance for your dependants.</li>
</ul><p>* This condition does not apply to your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant.
However any income they have from work is taken into account in the means test.
</p>

<h3>Means test</h3>

<p>The main items taken into account for the means test include:</p>

<p><strong>All cash income</strong></p>

<p>Most social welfare and Health Service Executive payments, except Child
Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and Blind Welfare Allowance, Guardian's
Payment (Contributory), Guardian's Payment (Non-Contributory) and the Carer's
Support Grant. </p>

<p>All financial compensation except compensation awarded by a court to certain
people (see 'Further information' below for details of compensation
payments.)</p>

<p><strong>Rehabilitative employment:</strong> Up to €120 from rehabilitative
employment is disregarded. </p>

<p><strong>The value of any benefit or privilege:</strong> If you are
<strong>24 years of age or under</strong> and you are living with a parent or a
step-parent in the family home, some of your parents' income will also be taken
into account in the assessment for Supplementary Welfare Allowance. The
Department of Social Protection calls this an <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/how_parents_income_can_affect_supplementary_welfare_allowance.html">assessment
of the 'benefit and privilege'</a> you get from living with your parents. <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/how_parents_income_can_affect_supplementary_welfare_allowance.html"></a></p>

<p><strong>The value of investments, savings or property</strong> (but not the
value of your own home) is calculated as follows: </p>

<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" border="1" summary=""><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Capital</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Weekly means assessed</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">First €5,000</td>

    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Balance</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€4 per €1,000 </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>If you are married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting your total income
is added together in the means test.</p>

<h3>Repayment of Supplementary Welfare Allowance</h3>

<p>In certain circumstances, you may have to repay any assistance you have
received under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme. For example:</p>

<p>If basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance is paid while you are waiting for a
social welfare benefit, assistance or pension, the amount paid will be deducted
from the arrears of your social welfare payment. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance is made up of a personal rate for
the applicant and additional amounts for any adult dependant and/or child
dependant(s). A child dependant is a person under the age of 18 who lives with
you and depends on you for financial support. If you have been getting SWA for
at least 26 weeks, the age limit is 22 for a child dependant in full-time
education or up to the end of the academic year after their 22nd birthday. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l07de2">Introduction </h2>

<p>Rent Supplement is paid to people living in private rented accommodation who
cannot provide for the cost of their accommodation from their own resources. In
general, you will qualify for a Rent Supplement, if your only income is a
social welfare payment and you satisfy the other conditions - see 'Rules'
below. </p>

<p>The amount of Rent Supplement you get will be calculated to ensure that your
income after paying rent does not fall below a minimum level. </p>

<p>If your circumstances change you may no longer qualify for Rent Supplement
or the amount of your payment may change. Read more about <a href="changes_to_rent_supplement.html">Rent Supplement and changes to your
circumstances</a>. You can also read <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/rent_faq.aspx">FAQs about Rent Supplement
from the Department of Social Protection</a>.</p>

<h3>Rent Supplement limits</h3>

<p>Revised rent limits for the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pressoffice/Pages/pr280616.aspx">Rent Supplement
scheme were announced in June 2016 and come into effect from Friday 1 July
2016</a>. </p>

<p>In view of the reduction of supply in the private rented market and
increasing rents, the Department's approach allows for flexibility where
landlords seek rents over the limits. This applies to existing tenants and to
new Rent Supplement applicants.</p>

<p>If you are making a new Rent Supplement claim, the new rent limits apply
immediately. If you are currently getting Rent Supplement there is no automatic
increase to your rate of Rent Supplement (as you are currently signed up to a
tenancy agreement with your landlord). The new rent limits will apply when your
existing lease expires or when your claim is reviewed. You can request a review
of your Rent Supplement claim by contacting the office dealing with your
claim.</p>

<p>The circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case basis and
rents can be increased above prescribed limits, as appropriate. In addition,
the Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special protocol in
areas where supply issues are particularly acute. Tenants in Dublin, Kildare,
Meath, Wicklow, and Cork city can access the <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/housing-supports/dublin.html">Tenancy Protection
Service</a> on 1800 454 454. </p>

<h3>Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)</h3>

<p>In 2013 the Government approved a plan for a new <a href="../../../housing/renting_a_home/housing_assistance_payment.html">Housing
Assistance Payment (HAP)</a>. This involves the transfer of responsibility for
recipients of Rent Supplement with a long-term housing need from the Department
of Social Protection to housing authorities. The legislation to implement the
HAP is the <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=26842&amp;CatID=87">Housing
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>HAP is now operational in many housing authorities. Find out where <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Local-Authorities-and-Household-Types-Designated-for-HAP-Purposes.aspx">HAP
is in operation</a>. It will be rolled out to further housing authorities in
2015. <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/SWA---Rent-Supplement.aspx">Different
rules apply for Rent Supplement</a> depending on whether you live in a HAP area
or in an area where HAP is not yet in operation. See ‘Rules’ below for
details.</p>

<h3>Discrimination when letting residential property</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/law_and_rights/irish_human_rights_commission.html">Equality
legislation</a> applies to lettings and accommodation. Landlords cannot
discriminate against potential tenants on grounds of gender, civil status,
family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race or
membership of the Traveller community.</p>

<p>Since 1 January 2016, under the Equal Status Acts 2000–2015, you cannot be
discriminated against when renting because you are getting Rent Supplement or
any other social welfare payment, or a Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).This
means that landlords can no longer state when advertising accommodation that
Rent Supplement (or HAP) is not accepted and they cannot refuse to rent you
accommodation because you are getting a social welfare payment. If you feel you
have been discriminated against by a landlord or their agent, <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/enforcement_and_redress/equality_tribunal.html">you
can find out more about making a complaint under the Equal Status Acts</a>. For
more information about your rights you can contact the <a href="http://www.ihrec.ie/">the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission</a>.
</p>

<p>A new tax relief has been introduced for landlords who rent to tenants
getting Rent Supplement. Read more in our document on <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/housing_tax_credits_and_reliefs.html">Housing
tax credits and reliefs</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Rent Supplement within Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) areas</h3>

<p>If you live in a HAP area you are only eligible for Rent Supplement if you
are a genuine (bona fide) tenant and meet one of the following conditions:</p>
<ul><li>You were getting Rent Supplement in the 12 months before the date of your
    application.</li>
  <li>You were living in private rented accommodation for at least 6 months
    (183 days) of the last 12 months, you could afford the rent at the
    beginning of your tenancy and you are unable to continue to pay the rent
    because of a substantial change in your circumstances which occurred after
    you started renting. You can combine time living in more than one rented
    accommodation to satisfy the 6 months (183 days).</li>
  <li>You were living in accommodation for homeless people for at least 6
    months (183 days) of the last 12 months. If you have already been assessed
    as qualified for social housing support you will be referred to your local
    authority to have your housing needs addressed (rather than being assessed
    for Rent Supplement).</li>
</ul><p>If you don’t meet these conditions you must contact your local authority
to have your housing needs assessed. If you are eligible for and in need of
housing support you may be able to access housing under the <a href="../../../housing/renting_a_home/housing_assistance_payment.html">HAP
scheme</a> or <a href="../../../housing/local_authority_and_social_housing/applying_for_local_authority_housing.html">local
authority housing</a>.</p>

<p>If you are currently getting long-term Rent Supplement (18 months or more)
and you live in a HAP area you can be asked to apply for social housing support
to your local authority. You must apply within 6 weeks of being asked to do so
(if necessary an extra 6 weeks can be allowed). You may then be transferred to
HAP or to another form of social housing support.</p>

<h3>Rent Supplement in areas where HAP is not yet in operation</h3>

<p>You may get Rent Supplement if you have been living for 6 months (183 days)
out of the last 12 months in one, or a combination, of the following: </p>
<ul><li>Accommodation for homeless people.</li>
  <li>Private rented accommodation. You can combine time living in more than
    one rented accommodation to satisfy the 6 months (183 days). You must be
    able to show that you could afford the rent at the beginning of your
    tenancy and that you could have continued to pay rent but are unable to do
    so because of a change in your circumstances which occurred after you
    started renting. </li>
  <li>An institution, for example, a hospital, care home or place of detention.
  </li>
</ul><p><strong>Or</strong></p>
<ul><li>Have been assessed by a local authority as being eligible for and in need
    of social housing in the last 12 months. If you don't have a housing need
    assessment, you must go to the local authority to have your housing need
    assessed. The local authority must be in the area that you intend to live
    and claim Rent Supplement. Only when you are assessed as eligible for and
    in need of housing can you apply for Rent Supplement. Rent Supplement is
    not payable while the <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/local_and_regional_government/local_authorities.html">local
    authority</a> is carrying out a housing needs assessment. </li>
</ul><h2>Rules for Rent Supplement in both HAP and non-HAP areas</h2>

<p>Rent Supplement will only be provided if the accommodation is suitable for
your needs. Rent Supplement is not generally paid if the rent is above the
maximum rent limit set for your county (see ‘Rates’ below for the current
limits and circumstances where these limits may be waived).</p>

<p><strong>You must also:</strong> </p>
<ul><li>Pass a <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitual
    residence test</a> </li>
  <li>Pass a means test</li>
</ul><p><strong>You won’t qualify for Rent Supplement if you:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Are in full-time employment or self-employment (30 hours or more a week).
    However, if you are assessed as in need of housing under the Rental
    Accommodation Scheme and have been out of full-time employment for 12
    months or more you may be entitled to the Supplement - see ‘Employment
    and Rent Supplement’ below </li>
  <li>Have refused a second offer of local authority accommodation in an
    12-month period. In this case, you cannot claim Rent Supplement for 12
    months. </li>
  <li>Are leaving local authority housing without reasonable cause.</li>
  <li>Have been excluded from social housing by a local authority for reasons
    of good estate management or anti-social behaviour.</li>
  <li>Are attending full-time education. However, if you are getting a <a shape="rect" href="../back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">Back to
    Education Allowance</a>, are participating in the <a shape="rect" href="../back_to_education/back_to_education_programme.html">Back to

    Programme</a> you may be entitled to Rent Supplement.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Renting from a parent:</strong> You cannot get Rent Supplement to
help you pay rent to your parent if you are living in the family home. If your
parent owns a second property, you will generally not get Rent Supplement for
this this property unless you can prove that you are a genuine (bona fide)
tenant</p>

<p><strong>Sharing with your landlord:</strong> You may be entitled to get Rent
Supplement if <a href="../../../housing/renting_a_home/sharing_accommodation_with_your_landlord.html">you
are living in your landlord’s home</a>. It must be a genuine landlord/tenant
arrangement. Your landlord has to fill in part of the form and provide his or
her PPS number (see 'How to apply' below). </p>

<h3>Employment and Rent Supplement </h3>

<p>You will <strong>not </strong>qualify for Rent Supplement if you are in
full-time employment (30 hours or more a week). (In the case of couples, if one
of a couple is in full time employment, both are excluded from claiming Rent
Supplement). Claims from self-employed people are assessed on the individual
circumstances of the case and you may be asked to show that you are working
less than 30 hours a week. If you are working over 30 hours a week in emploment
or self-employment or if you are getting the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance
you must be deemed eligible for the <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/local_authority_and_social_housing/rental_accommodation_scheme.html">Rental
Accommodation Scheme</a> (RAS) by your local authority to continue to get Rent
Supplement. </p>

<p>However, you will be reassessed for Rent Supplement and some of your
additional income including some of your income from employment will be taken
into account. As a result of the reassessment you may or may not continue to
qualify for Rent Supplement. If you do qualify for Rent Supplement you may get
a different rate of Supplement.</p>

<h3>Income taken into account for Rent Supplement</h3>
<ul><li>Net income from employment (this is gross income less PRSI and reasonable

<h3>Income not taken into account when calculating Rent Supplement</h3>

<p>Income from the following sources is disregarded or not taken in account
when calculating the amount of Rent Supplement you qualify for: </p>
<ul><li>An amount equal to the <a shape="rect" href="supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary Welfare Allowance
    (SWA)</a> rate for your household circumstances </li>

  <li>Maintenance grants paid by VEC or local authorities for educational

  <li>Guardian's Payment (Contributory) and Guardian's Payment

  <li>Fuel Allowance and the Living Alone Allowance</li>
  <li><strong>Pensioners:</strong> If you are aged 65 or over (or where one of
    a couple is of pensionable age) and have a combined household income
    greater than the rate of SWA appropriate to your household circumstances,
    the difference between the maximum rate of <a shape="rect" href="../older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html">State
    Pension (Contributory)</a> appropriate to your circumstance and the rate of
    SWA appropriate to your circumstances is not taken into account. </li>
  <li><strong>Carers' payments:</strong> The <a shape="rect" href="../carers/half_rate_carers_allowance.html">half-rate Carer's
    Allowance</a> is never taken into account. </li>
  <li>If you are getting <a shape="rect" href="../carers/carers_allowance.html">Carer's Allowance</a>, the amount of
    Carer's Allowance above the appropriate SWA rate for your situation (either
    the qualified adult rate for a couple or the personal rate of SWA) is not
    taken into account. So if you are one of a <strong>couple</strong> and
    getting Carer's Allowance the amount of Carer's Allowance being paid less
    the SWA qualified adult rate is not taken into account and if you are
    <strong>single or a lone parent</strong> the amount disregarded is the rate
    of Carer's Allowance being paid less the personal rate of SWA. </li>
  <li>Any amount of <a shape="rect" href="../carers/carers_benefit.html">Carer's Benefit</a> in excess of the
    basic SWA rate for your situation (either the qualified adult rate or the
    personal rate of SWA) is not taken into account. </li>
  <li><strong>Rehabilitative earnings disregard</strong>: A certain amount of
    your income from rehabilitative work which is not taken into account. If
    you are getting Disability Allowance or Blind Pension, €120 from
    rehabilitative training or employment is not taken into account in the
    assessment for Rent Supplement. Any earnings over €120 from
    rehabilitative training or employment will affect your Rent Supplement. If
    you are earning above €120 you can be assessed using whichever disregard
    is most in your interest - either the <em>Rehabilitative earnings
    disregard</em> or the <em>Additional income disregard</em> (but not both).
  </li>
  <li><strong>Additional income disregard</strong>: A certain amount of your
    household income from certain sources is not taken into account. €75 of
    any <em>additional household income*</em> above the SWA rate for your
    circumstances is not taken into account. Also, 25% of <em>additional
    household income</em> over €75 is not taken into account. There is no
    upper limit on the amount that can be disregarded. 
    <p><strong>*Additional household income</strong> is income from part-time
    employment or part-time self-employment, Family Income Supplement (FIS),
    Community Employment (CE), the Tús scheme, JobBridge,the Rural Social
    Scheme, Momentum, Part-time Job Incentive Scheme, Skillnets, Work Placement
    Scheme, Gateway, Back to Work Allowance, Back to Work Enterprise Allowance
    or a FET (formerly FÁS) course. Part of a maintenance payment is also
    assessed as additional household income (see below).</p>
  </li>
</ul><p>If you were getting Rent Supplement before 5 June 2007, you can continue to
have your income assessed using the old income disregards, unless the current
income disregards ensure a more favourable assessment. However, if you do not
claim Rent Supplement for more than 13 weeks you will be assessed using the
current income disregards. <a shape="rect" href="" name="Income_assessment_2007" id="Income_assessment_2007"></a>(See 'Further
information' below for more information on how income was assessed for Rent
Supplement before 5 June 2007.)</p>

<h3>Maintenance and Rent Supplement</h3>

<p>Maintenance is assessed as <em>additional household income</em> (see above)
and maintenance payments up to €95.23 per week are assessed in full. The
household income disregard (see above) applies to maintenance payments above
this amount. The reason for this is that the first €95.23 per week of
maintenance payments are considered to be a contribution towards your housing
expenses. </p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> if your only additional household income is
maintenance, all of your maintenance payment up to €95.23 per week is
assessed in full. The household income disregard of €75 applies to sums above
this, so that any maintenance between €95.23 and €170.23 is not taken into
account. 25% of all maintenance over €170.23 is also not taken into
account.</p>

<h3>Your contribution to rent (Household Contribution)</h3>

<p>Once the amount of Rent Supplement you qualify for has been worked out, it
will be reduced by a minimum of €30. This is because you must pay at least
€30 a week towards your rent. You may pay more than €30 because you are
also required to contribute any additional assessable means that you have above
the appropriate basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance rate towards your rent.
If you are <strong>one of a couple</strong> and are claiming Rent Supplement
you must pay at least €40 a week towards your rent. </p>

<p>Any non-dependent household members who are solely dependent on a personal
social welfare payment must also contribute €30. However, if <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/how_parents_income_can_affect_jobseekers_allowance.html">benefit
and privilege</a> has been assessed against your social welfare payment you do
not have to contribute €30. If the non-dependent household members are a
couple their contribution is €40. </p>

<p>A couple over 65 with an income equal to or less than the State Pension
(Contributory) for their situation will contribute €40 a week towards their
rent. A couple who both have State Pensions (Contributory) and no other income
will also contribute €40 towards their weekly rent.</p>

<h3>Calculating Rent Supplement</h3>

<p>Calculating your Rent Supplement can be difficult. The Department of Social
Protection's representative (formerly known as the Community Welfare Officer)
will decide if you are eligible for Rent Supplement and calculate the amount
you will get. <a shape="rect" href="calculating_rent_supplement.html">More
information is available on how to calculate Rent Supplement</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Rent Supplement is paid to you weekly or monthly by cheque, Electronic Fund
Transfer or post draft, usually in arrears. </p>

<p>The amount of Rent Supplement that is calculated will generally ensure that
your income, after paying rent, does not fall below a minimum level. This level
is the <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/reference/checklists/checklist_swa_rates_for_rent_supplement.html">basic
Supplementary Welfare Allowance rate for your circumstances</a> minus €30 (or
€40 for a couple). You must always pay at least €30 towards your rent.
However, you may pay more depending on your means - see 'Rules' above.</p>

<p>The rent paid to your landlord (that is, your contribution plus your Rent
Supplement) should not be above the maximum rent limit set for your county or
area (this provision can be waived in some circumstances). The maximum rent
limit for your county is set by the Department of Social Protection (DSP).
However, the Community Welfare Office may set <strong>lower rates</strong>
within these limits. There is a maximum rent limit for each area (see below).
If your actual rent is higher than the local maximum, you may be refused Rent
Supplement entirely. </p>

<h3>Cases where rent is over the relevant limit</h3>

<p>In some cases Rent Supplement can be paid at the discretion of the DSP staff
administering the scheme where the rent is over the relevant limit:</p>
<ul><li>If you or a member of your household has special housing needs (for
    example, a disabled person in specially adapted accommodation).</li>
  <li>If you will be able to pay the rent yourself within a short period, if,
    for example, if you are taking up employment. In this case Rent Supplement
    at a higher rate can be paid for a short period of 6-8 weeks.</li>
  <li>If you have additional income to pay the balance yourself. (Rent
    Supplement is still based on the maximum rent limit.)</li>
  <li>If there are other exceptional circumstances. (Special provisions apply
    if you are <a href="../../../housing/losing_your_home/homelessness.html">at risk of
    becoming homeless</a>.) Note also that the Community Welfare Service has
    statutory discretionary power to award or increase a Rent Supplement
    payment, for example, when dealing with a person who is in danger of
    homelessness. This applies both to people getting Rent Supplement and new
    applicants. Tenants in Counties Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, and Cork
    city, can access the <a href="http://www.threshold.ie/housing-supports/dublin.html">Tenancy
    Protection Service</a> on 1800 454 454. </li>
</ul><h4>Rent Supplement and lease agreements</h4>

<p>If, when your Rent Supplement claim is reviewed, the rent you pay is above
the relevant limit and your lease is not due for renewal, you will be expected
to re-negotiate your rent with your landlord. If the landlord insists that the
terms of the current lease are not negotiable and does not reduce the rent to
the new limits the DSP representative will discuss your options with you. These
may include seeking other accommodation. If the rent is in line with local
market rates the limits can be exceeded in some cases.</p>

<h2>Maximum rent limits for each county</h2>

<p>Revised rent limits for the Rent Supplement scheme as announced in June
2016, <strong>with effect from Friday, 1 July 2016. </strong>Note that the
Community Welfare Office may set lower rates within these limits. </p>

</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>To apply, fill in an <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Forms/Documents/swa_rs1.pdf">application form
for Rent Supplement (pdf).</a> The Department of Social Protection's
representative (formerly known as the Community Welfare Officer) or local
Citizens Information Service can help you fill in this form.</p>

<p>Part of the form will need to be filled in by your landlord or their agent.
Your landlord will need to provide their tax reference number (normally their
PPS number) to the Department of Social Protection (DSP). If your landlord does
not wish to fill in the form <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Forms/Documents/SWA3C.pdf">a separate form (SWA
3C) (pdf)</a> is available. If your landlord does not have a tax reference
number, they should state this in writing to the DSP and explain why this is
the case. Your Rent Supplement may not be paid if your landlord has not given
their tax number to the DSP or has not explained why they do not have one. </p>

<p>Another part of the form may need to be filled in by your local authority,
to confirm you are on their housing list and have a housing need (if you are
not exempt from this rule). </p>

<p>You also need to bring the following documents:</p>
<ul><li>Identity documents for you and your dependents, such as full birth
    certificates, passports, driving license, work permit, immigration (GNIB)
    card, etc. </li>
  <li>Documents to show your income and financial situation, such as, pay
    slips, P45, P35, P60, bank statements, etc. </li>
  <li>Documents to prove where you live, such as electricity, gas or phone
    bills, etc. </li>
  <li>Documents relating to your tenancy, such as your rent book, lease or
    tenancy agreement. </li>
</ul><p>The Department of Social Protection's representative (formerly known as the
Community Welfare Officer) usually visits you to confirm your circumstances.</p>

<h3>Appealing a decision</h3>

<p>If you are not satisfied with a decision made in relation to Rent
Supplement, you should first find out why the decision was made by asking the
Department of Social Protection's representative (formerly known as the
Community Welfare Officer). You should provide any extra documentation to back
up your case. </p>

<p>If the decision is not changed, then request an appeal form. Include as much
detail as possible in your appeal and keep photocopies of everything. </p>

<p>If your appeal is unsuccessful, you can refer the appeal to the <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_welfare_system_in_ireland.html">Social
Welfare Appeals Office</a>. You may request a personal hearing and you can
bring along a representative to help argue your case.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="lef21f">Where to apply</h2>

<p>To apply for Rent Supplement you should contact the Department of Social
Protection's representative (formerly known as the Community Welfare Officer)
at your <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/otheroffice/community-welfare-office-contact.aspx">local
office.</a> However in some areas new Rent Supplement applications are
processed by centralised Rent Units. To see if your area is dealt with by a
central Rent Unit you can view <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Central-Rents-Units.aspx">the central rent
unit list</a>.</p>

<p>If you live in one of these areas you can get a rent pack from your local
office. This pack contains detailed information (including a list of
documentation you will need) and all the relevant application forms. You should
read the information in the pack carefully. If you are satisfied that you have
all the necessary documents ready you can forward your application to the
relevant Rent Unit. The processing of your application may be delayed if you do
not supply all the information requested in the pack. The Unit will contact you
if they need any further information. If they do not need any more information
they will tell you when your application will be processed.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic further_info">
<h2 class="further_info" id="l23f7d">Further information</h2>

<p>A certain amount of your income is not taken into account in the assessment
for Rent Supplement. The income not taken into account is called an <em>income
disregard</em>. The current income disregards came into effect on 5 June
2007.</p>

<p>All existing Rent Supplement claims in payment on 5 June 2007 were reviewed
and assessed using both the current income disregards and the old income
disregards. If you would get more Rent Supplement using the old income
disregards (see below), you continued to be assessed using the old income
disregards until:</p>
<ul><li>You no longer qualify for Rent Supplement or </li>
  <li>You have a break in your claim for more than 13 weeks or </li>
  <li>You have a change in your circumstances. For example, a change of
    address, household income, increase or decrease in rent or a change in your
    social welfare payment. </li>

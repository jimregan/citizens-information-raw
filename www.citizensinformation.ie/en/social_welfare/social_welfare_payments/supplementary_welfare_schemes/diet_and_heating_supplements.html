<h3>Diet supplement</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pressoffice/Pages/pr310114.aspx">The diet
supplement was discontinued for <strong>new applicants</strong> from 1 February
2014.</a></p>

<p>However, people who were getting Diet Supplement before 1 February 2014 can
continue to keep the payment (for as long as they continue to be entitled to
the payment).</p>

<p>You are entitled to retain the diet supplement for a <em>prescribed
diet,</em> if you: </p>
<ul><li>Have a specified medical condition </li>
  <li>Meet the conditions for Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) and</li>
  <li>Satisfy a means test</li>
</ul><p>To get a diet supplement, a hospital consultant or a hospital registrar must
certify:</p>
<ul><li>That you or your <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">adult
    dependant</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_and_increase_in_your_payment_for_a_child_dependant.html">child
    dependant</a> has been prescribed a diet because of a specified medical
    condition </li>
  <li>The type of diet prescribed </li>
  <li>How long you will need the prescribed diet. </li>
</ul><p>A <strong>gluten-free diet</strong> for an adult or a child aged 18 to 22
may be prescribed by your family doctor (GP).</p>

<p>In the case of diet supplements, for example, for people with cystic
fibrosis, the <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/health_related_benefits_and_entitlements/long_term_illness_scheme.html">long-term
illness scheme</a> book may be accepted as verification that such a diet has
been prescribed. The length of time for which the diet is being prescribed and
the type of diet must be stated. </p>

<h3>Qualifying diets</h3>

<p>The weekly cost of each prescribed diet is set by the Department of Social
Protection. The following diets qualify for the diet supplement: </p>

<p>The heating supplement is an additional weekly payment to help with the cost
of heating your home. You may get a heating supplement, if you: </p>
<ul><li>Can show you have extra heating needs because of your age, medical
    condition or disability </li>

  </li>
  <li>Satisfy a means test<br></li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<h3>Adult diet supplement</h3>

<p><span>The rate </span><span>for a single person and lone parent is
calculated as follows: </span>The diet cost as set by the Department of Social
Protection, less <span>one-third</span> of your social welfare payment at the
<strong>2007</strong> rate = the diet supplement to be paid to you. <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/sw19_07.pdf">You can check the rates
for 2007 in SW19 (pdf)</a>. </p>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>
<ul><li>Paul is on a high-protein, high-calorie diet and is getting a One-Parent
    Family Payment. The Department of Social Protection has set the cost of
    this diet at €71.43. Take one-third of his social welfare payment
    (<span>excluding any amount he is getting for a child dependant</span>)
    from €71.43 to get the amount of diet supplement payable. (€71.43 -
    €61.93 (or one-third of his One Parent Family Payment at the 2007 rate) =
    €9.50 paid as diet supplement) </li>
</ul><p><span>The rate for a married or cohabiting couple is calculated as follows:
</span>The diet cost as set by the Department of Social Protection less
<span>one-sixth</span> of your social welfare payment at the
<strong>2007</strong> rate = the diet supplement to be paid to you.</p>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>
<ul><li>Mary is married and on a high-protein high-calorie diet and is getting
    Jobseeker's Allowance. The Department of Social Protection has set the cost
    of this diet at €71.43 . Take one-sixth of her social welfare payment
    (<span>excluding any amount she is getting for a child dependant</span>)
    from €71.43 to get the amount of diet supplement payable. (€71.43 -
    €51.52 (one-sixth of her Jobseeker's Allowance payment including an
    increase for her adult dependant at the 2007 rate) = €19.91 paid as diet
    supplement) </li>
</ul><h3>People getting Rent or Mortgage Interest Supplement</h3>

<p>If you are getting Rent Supplement or Mortgage Interest Supplement, the
Supplementary Welfare Allowance personal rate for 2007, and qualified adult
rate where applicable, is used to calculate the amount of diet supplement. In
assessing your means, any increases in social welfare payments for children are
not taken into account. </p>

<h3>Child diet supplement</h3>

<p><span>The diet supplement rates for a qualified child are as
follows:</span></p>
<ul><li>Low-lactose, milk-free diet = €3.50 </li>
  <li>Gluten-free diet = €6.50 </li>
  <li>High-protein, high-calorie diet = €9.50 </li>
  <li>Altered-consistency (liquidised) diet = €13 </li>
</ul><p>A child is considered to be a dependant if they are under 18, or are over 18
and under 22 and in full-time education. </p>

<h3>Heating supplement</h3>

<p>There is no fixed rate for heating supplement. The amount of heating
supplement you get is based on your need as assesed by your Department of
Social Protection's representative (formerly known as the Community Welfare
Officer).</p>

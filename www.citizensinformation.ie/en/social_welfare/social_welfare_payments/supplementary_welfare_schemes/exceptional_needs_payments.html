<p>Exceptional Needs Payments are paid under the Supplementary Welfare
Allowance Scheme. You do not have to meet <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">the
habitual residence condition</a> to qualify.</p>

<p>An Exceptional Needs Payment is a single payment to help meet essential,
once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be
expected to meet out of their weekly income. For example, the payments can be
for special clothing for a person who has a serious illness, bedding or cooking
utensils for someone setting up a home for the first time, visiting relatives
in hospital or prison, or funeral costs. You can also apply for financial help
for clothing for children. Exceptional Needs Payments are no longer paid for
religious ceremonies, mainly communions and confirmations. </p>

<p><strong>Help with funeral costs</strong></p>

<p>You may be eligible for an Exceptional Needs Payment to help you with the
cost of a funeral if your income is low. Each case is decided on its merits by
the Department of Social Protection's representative (formerly known as the
Community Welfare Officer) at your <a href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/otheroffice/community-welfare-office-contact.aspx">local
office</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Help with fuel bills</strong></p>

<p>You may get help with the cost of your electricity or natural gas bill but
only in exceptional circumstances. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Before you start to calculate your Rent Supplement you must check whether
you qualify. Make sure you read our document on <a shape="rect" href="rent_supplement.html">Rent Supplement</a>. You should use the <a href="../../../reference/worksheets/worksheet_for_calculating_rent_supplement.html">worksheet
for calculating Rent Supplement</a> with this document.</p>

<p>Calculating Rent Supplement is very complex. The Department of Social
Protection's (DSP) representative (formerly known as the Community Welfare
Officer) will calculate your entitlement to Rent Supplement. If you have any
questions about your entitlement to Rent Supplement you should contact your
local DSP representative.</p>

<p>This document shows you the steps involved in calculating Rent Supplement.
There are 6 steps:</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l3b069">Step 1: Calculate your gross assessable
weekly income from all sources</h2>

<p>Include all income you and your spouse, partner or cohabitant have from DSP
payments, Family Income Supplement, employment or training schemes and gross
income from employment or self-employment. Include all income from maintenance
if applicable. Include any means from capital that you have (see below). </p>

<p>Some income is not counted for Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) schemes
so you do not need to include it when working out your gross income. The
following items are not taken into account as income:</p>
<ul><li>Child Benefit</li>
  <li>Mobility Allowance</li>
  <li>Foster care payments from the Health Service Executive</li>
  <li>Payments for accommodating children under the Child Care Act</li>
  <li>Income from Gaeltacht students</li>
  <li>Grants or allowances from schemes promoting the welfare of blind
  people</li>
  <li>Money received from charitable organisations, for example, St Vincent de
    Paul</li>
  <li>Compensation awarded by the Compensation Tribunal in respect of Hepatitis
    C contracted from certain blood products, to those who have disabilities
    caused by Thalidomide and to those receiving compensation under the
    Residential Institutions Redress Board</li>
  <li>Maintenance grants paid for educational purposes</li>
  <li>Domiciliary Care Allowance</li>
  <li>Half-rate Carer's Allowance</li>
  <li>Respite Care Grant</li>
  <li>Guardian's Payment (Contributory) and Guardian's Payment
    (Non-Contributory)</li>
</ul><p>From January 2012 income from working as a home help with the HSE is taken
into account. </p>

<p>The capital value of property (except your own home), investments and
savings are assessed on a weekly basis as follows:</p>

<p>First €5,000 is not taken into account <br>
Next €10,000 is assessed at €1 per €1,000 <br>
Next €25,000 is assessed at €2 per €1,000 <br>
Any capital over €40,000 is assessed at €4 per €1,000.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l5a431">Step 2: Find out what your income in excess
of the SWA rate is</h2>

<p>To do this you deduct the Over 65 disregard, the Carer’s disregard, travel
costs, PRSI and the <a href="../../../reference/checklists/checklist_swa_rates_for_rent_supplement.html">appropriate
basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) rate for your circumstances</a>
from your gross assessable income to find out what your income in excess of the
SWA rate is.</p>

<p><strong>Over 65 disregard:</strong> If you are aged 65 or over (or where one
of a couple is of pensionable age) and have a combined household income greater
than the rate of SWA appropriate to your household circumstances, you are
allowed a disregard. This disregard is equal to the difference between the
maximum rate of State Pension (Contributory) appropriate to your circumstances
and the rate of SWA appropriate to your circumstances (even if you are not
getting a pension). The effect of this is that a person whose only income is a
State pension will pay no more than the minimum household contribution towards
their rent.</p>

<p>For example, the Over-65 disregard for a person aged 65 or over would be the
maximum State Pension (Contributory) rate (€230.60) minus the SWA rate for a
single person (€186) which is €44.30.</p>

<p>The Over 65 disregard for a couple who are both aged 66 and getting separate
payments or working would be worked out using the maximum State Pension
(Contributory) rate for 2 people minus the basic SWA rate for a couple
(€460.60 - €310.80 = €149.80). Their Over 65 disregard would be
€149.80.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Carer’s disregard:</strong> If you are getting a carer's payment,
the amount of Carer's Allowance or Benefit in payment above the appropriate SWA
rate for your situation (either the adult dependant rate for a couple or the
personal rate for a single person) is not taken into account. To get your
carer’s disregard you subtract the relevant rate of SWA (either €124.80 or
€186) from the actual rate of Carer’s Allowance or Benefit you are getting
(not including any Increases for Qualified Children).</p>

<p>Your travel costs will vary depending on where you live – ask your local
Community Welfare Office for more information.</p>

<p>See <a href="../../../reference/checklists/checklist_swa_rates_for_rent_supplement.html">sample
SWA rates for different family groupings and circumstances</a>.</p>

<p>The figure for <em>income in excess of the SWA rate</em> is <em>your
contribution from means</em> (in addition to your minimum household
contribution) if Step 3 does not apply to you</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l2514d">Step 3: Calculate the Additional Income
disregard or Rehabilitative Earnings disregard (if applicable)</h2>

<p>The <em>Additional Income disregard</em> is a certain amount of your
household income which is not taken into account. The first €75 of any
additional household income above the SWA rate for your circumstances is not
taken into account. Also, 25% of your additional household income over €75 is
not taken into account. There is no upper limit on the amount that can be
disregarded.</p>

<p>Additional income includes income from the following:</p>
<ul><li>Part-time employment or part-time self-employment (under 30 hours per
    week)</li>
  <li>Full-time employment or full-time self-employment (30 hours or over per
    week) where you are accepted as being in need of accommodation under the
    Rental Accommodation Scheme.</li>
  <li>SOLAS training allowances or training provided on behalf of the
    Department of Education and Skills (for example, YouthReach) and ETB/VEC
    training,</li>
  <li>Back to Work Allowance and the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance</li>
  <li>Rural Social Scheme</li>
  <li>TÚS</li>
  <li>JobBridge</li>
  <li>The Part-time Job Incentive Scheme</li>
  <li>Community Employment</li>
  <li>Momentum and Skillnets</li>
  <li>Work Placement Scheme</li>
  <li>Gateway Scheme</li>
  <li>Family Income Supplement</li>
  <li>Maintenance over €95.23*</li>
</ul><p>*Maintenance is assessed as additional income and maintenance payments up to
€95.23 per week are assessed in full. (The reason for this is that the first
€95.23 per week of maintenance payments are considered to be a contribution
towards your housing expenses.) The Additional Income disregard applies to
maintenance payments above this amount. If you are getting maintenance under
€95.23 do not include it in this step. If your maintenance is over €95.23
you should subtract €95.25 and include the excess maintenance when working
out your Additional Income disregard.</p>

<p>You work out your additional income using the formula: (A+B) – C or the
value of A – whichever is the smallest amount.</p>

<p>A = income from employment, prescribed employment or training schemes,
Family Income Supplement and maintenance payments of over €95.23 a week</p>

<p>B = assessable weekly income from all other sources</p>

<p>C = <a href="../../../reference/checklists/checklist_swa_rates_for_rent_supplement.html">SWA
rate for family circumstances</a> </p>

<p>You subtract PRSI, pension contributions and Revenue-approved income
continuance payments from your additional income figure.</p>

<p>You then subtract €75 and get 25% of the remaining figure. Add €75 and
25% of the subtotal together – this is your <em>Additional Income disregard.
</em></p>

<table border="1"><caption></caption>
  <col><tbody><tr><td><strong>For example:</strong> 

        <p>Mary has 1 child. She works and earns €385 weekly in a part-time
        job. She gets a One-Parent Family payment of €95.30 a week and
        maintenance of €80 a week. Her additional income is:</p>

        <p>A= €385</p>

        <p>B= €95.30</p>

        <p>C= €215.80</p>

        <p>(A+B) – C= €264.50</p>

        <p>Subtract PRSI (4% of €385=€15.40)</p>

        <p>€249.10 - €75 = €174.10</p>

        <p>25% of €174.10 = €43.52</p>

        <p>Mary's Additional Income disregard is <strong>€118.52</strong></p>
      </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<p>The <em>Rehabilitative Earnings disregard</em> is up to €120 from
rehabilitative training or employment which is not taken into account in the
assessment for Rent Supplement. All rehabilitative earnings over €120 are
taken into account and will affect your Rent Supplement. If your earnings are
under €120 then use that figure as your Rehabilitative Earnings disregard.</p>

<p>If you are working and getting Disability Allowance or Blind Pension you can
either use the Rehabilitative Earnings disregard or the Additional Income
disregard (but not both). Use whichever is in your best interest.</p>

<p>You should always work out what your Additional Income disregard would be
and compare it to your Rehabilitative Earnings disregard.</p>

<table border="1" style="width: 100%"><caption></caption>
  <col><tbody><tr><td><strong>For example:</strong> 

        <p>Jack gets Disability Allowance and earns €180 a week. His
        Rehabilitative Earnings disregard is €120. His Additional Income
        disregard would be €101.75 so it is more beneficial for him to use
        the Rehabilitative Earnings disregard.</p>

        <p>Petra gets Disability Allowance and earns €70 a week. Her
        Rehabilitative Earnings disregard would be €70 a week. Her Additional
        Income disregard would be €72 so it is more beneficial for her to use
        the Additional Income disregard.</p>

    </tr></tbody></table></div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lf8625">Step 4: Calculate your contribution from
means</h2>

<p>You subtract the disregards you calculated in Step 3 from the figure you
calculated in Step 2 to get <em>your contribution from means</em>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="la5987">Step 5: Find your total contribution to your
rent</h2>

<p>Find the total amount you must pay towards your rent. To do this, add your
<em>contribution from means</em> (this is the total figure after Step 4) and
your <em>minimum Household contribution</em>.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Minimum Household contribution</strong></p>

<p>In general, a household (this is the claimant and may also include a
qualified adult and qualified children) must contribute at least €30 towards
rent. If you are one of a couple you contribute €40. </p>

<p>From January 2017, people aged 18-24 who are on age related benefits pay
less towards the cost of their Rent Supplement. The personal rent contribution
is reduced from €30 to €10 per week for Rent Supplement recipients who are
getting Jobseeker’s Allowance (JA) or Supplementary Welfare Allowance of
€100 per week and from €30 to €20 for those who are getting JA of €144.
For those getting Back to Education Allowance, a Further Education and Training
(FET) training allowance or on Youthreach, where the age-related rate of €160
applies, the personal rent contribution is reduced from €30 to €20 a
week.</p>

<p>Non-dependent household members who are solely dependent on a personal
social welfare payment must also contribute at least €30. However, if <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/how_parents_income_can_affect_supplementary_welfare_allowance.html">benefit
and privilege</a> has been assessed against your social welfare payment you
will not have to contribute €30.</p>

<p>The DSP's representative (formerly known as the Community Welfare Officer)
can reduce the amount of Rent Supplement payable by an amount which, in their
opinion, is payable by each non-dependent household member in employment.
Custom and practice is that the assessable income of the non-dependent
household member (that is, gross income less PRSI and travel costs to work) is
divided by the appropriate rate of SWA for their situation which is then
multiplied by €30 to establish their liability to contribute. </p>

<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" border="1" width="600" summary=""><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>For example:</strong></p>

        <p>If your 26 year old daughter is living with you and earning €700
        per week:</p>

        <p>€700 ÷ €186 (SWA) = €3.76 </p>

        <p>Multiply €3.76 by €30 = €112.80</p>

        <p>In this case, your Rent Supplement is reduced by €112.80</p>
      </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>A couple aged over 65 with an income equal or less than the State Pension
(Contributory) for their situation will contribute €40 towards their rent. A
couple who both have State Pensions (Contributory) and no other income will
also contribute €40 towards their rent.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="ld3c6a">Step 6: Find your Rent Supplement
payment</h2>

<p>To calculate your Rent Supplement you subtract <em>your total contribution
to rent</em> from your weekly rent.</p>

<p>In Step 5, you found <em>your total contribution to your rent</em>. Now you
need to find out how much your weekly rent is. You may already know how much
your weekly rent is. If you pay your rent by month, you must multiply your
monthly rent figure by 12 and divide it by 52 to get your weekly rent figure.
Your rent must not be above the maximum limit set for your area.</p>

<p></p>

<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" border="1" width="600" summary=""><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>For example</strong> 

        <p>Susan and Paul are living in Dublin and paying €900 per month for
        accommodation. </p>

        <p>To get the weekly rent figure, multiply €900 by 12 and divide by
        52.</p>

        <p>Monthly rent €900</p>

        <p>(Multiply by 12 months ) x 12 = €10,800 a year</p>

        <p>€(Divide by 52 weeks) ÷ 52 = €207.70 a week</p>

        <p>Weekly rent is €207.70</p>
      </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<p>A maximum rent level is set for each county. The maximum rent level for your
county is set by the Department of Social Protection. The Community Welfare
Service may set lower rates within these limits. If your actual rent is higher
than the local maximum, you may be refused Rent Supplement. </p>

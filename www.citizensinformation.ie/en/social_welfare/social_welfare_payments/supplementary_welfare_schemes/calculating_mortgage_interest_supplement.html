<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l07de2">Introduction </h2>

<p><strong>From 1 January 2014, the Mortgage Interest Supplement scheme is
closed to new entrants and no new applications will be accepted from this
date.</strong> This measure does not affect current claimants immediately
(people who were getting Mortgage Interest Supplement before 1 January 2014).
The scheme will be wound down for existing claimants over a 4-year period.</p>

<p>Before you start to calculate your Mortgage Interest Supplement you must
check whether you qualify. More information on the qualifying criteria is
available in our document on <a shape="rect" href="mortgage_interest_supplement.html">Mortgage Interest Supplement</a>. </p>

<p>You will only get help with the interest portion of your mortgage
repayments. You will not get help with the portion that pays off the actual
loan and house insurance. Your interest is assessed as your gross monthly
interest less any <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/owning_a_home/buying_a_home/mortgage_interest_relief.html">mortgage
interest relief</a> and any <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/owning_a_home/help_with_buying_a_home/mortgage_allowance_scheme.html">mortgage
allowance</a> or <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/owning_a_home/help_with_buying_a_home/affordable_housing.html">mortgage
subsidy</a> payable towards the interest part of your mortgage by the local
authority.</p>

<p>Calculating Mortgage Interest Supplement is very complex. The Department of
Social Protection's representative (formerly known as the Community Welfare
Officer) will calculate your entitlement to Mortgage Interest Supplement. If
you have any questions about your entitlement to Mortgage Interest Supplement
you should contact your local DSP representative.</p>

<p>This document shows you the steps involved in calculating Mortgage Interest
Supplement. There are 5 steps:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong> is to find your <em>weekly household income</em>.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Steps 2 and 3</strong> are to find out your <em>weekly assessable
    income</em>. Only a certain amount of your weekly household income is taken
    into account. Your <em>assessable income</em> is the amount of household
    income which is taken into account when calculating your Mortgage Interest
    Supplement. </li>
  <li><strong>Step 4</strong> is to find your <em>total monthly contribution to
    mortgage interest</em> by adding your weekly assessable income and the
    minimum Household Contribution. </li>
  <li><strong>Step 5</strong> is to find your Mortgage Interest Supplement by
    subtracting your <em>total monthly contribution to your mortgage</em>
    interest from the monthly mortgage interest due to your lender. </li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="ld6782">Step 1: Find weekly household income </h2>

<p>Find your total weekly household income. For example:</p>

<p><strong>Income source</strong> <strong>Amount per week<br></strong>Assessable income from part-time employment - see <strong>Note
1</strong> <br>
Social welfare payments <br>
FÁS training allowance <br>
Family Income Supplement<br>
Cash income (for example, maintenance)<br>
Capital (for example, property, savings and investments) - see <strong>Note
2</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Note 1</strong><br>
Assessable income from part-time employment is gross income less PRSI and
reasonable travel expenses. </p>

<p>How your travel expenses are assessed can depend on where you live. </p>

<p><strong>Note 2<br></strong>The capital value of property (except your own home), investments and
savings will be assessed on a weekly basis as follows:</p>

<p>First €5,000 is not taken into account<br>
Next €10,000 is assessed at €1 per €1,000<br>
Next €25,000 is assessed at €2 per €1,000<br>
Any capital over €40,000 is assessed at €4 per €1,000.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l1105d">Step 2: Subtract income disregards </h2>

<p>Subtract any income not taken into account in the assessment for Mortgage
Interest Supplement. Income not taken into account is also known as an income
disregard.</p>

<h3>Main income disregards</h3>

<p>The following items are not taken into account as income for calculating
Mortgage Interest Supplement:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child
    Benefit</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../../../travel_and_recreation/transport_and_disability/mobility_allowance.html">Mobility
    Allowance</a> </li>
  <li>Foster care payments from the Health Service Executive (HSE) </li>
  <li>Payments for accommodating children under the Child Care Act </li>
  <li>Income from Gaeltacht students </li>
  <li>Grants or allowances from schemes promoting the welfare of blind people
  </li>
  <li>Money received from charitable organisations, for example, St Vincent de
    Paul </li>
  <li>Compensation awarded by the Compensation Tribunal in respect of Hepatitis
    C contracted from certain blood products, to those who have disabilities
    caused by Thalidomide and to those receiving compensation under the
    Residential Institutions Redress Board </li>
  <li>Maintenance grants paid by VEC or Local Authorities for educational
    purposes </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../disability_and_illness/domiciliary_care_allowance.html">Domiciliary
    Care Allowance</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../carers/respite_care_grant.html">Respite Care
    Grant</a> </li>
  <li>Guardian's Payment (Contributory) and Guardian's Payment
    (Non-Contributory) </li>
  <li><strong>Pensioners:</strong> If you are aged 65 or over (or where one of
    a couple is of pensionable age) and have a combined household income
    greater than the rate of SWA appropriate to your household circumstances,
    the difference between the maximum rate of <a shape="rect" href="../older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html">State
    Pension (Contributory)</a> appropriate to your circumstance and the rate of
    SWA appropriate to your circumstances is not taken into account. </li>
  <li><strong>Carers' payments:</strong> The <a shape="rect" href="../carers/half_rate_carers_allowance.html">half-rate Carer's
    Allowance</a> is never taken into account. </li>
  <li>If you are getting <a shape="rect" href="../carers/carers_allowance.html">Carer's Allowance</a>, the amount of
    Carer's Allowance above the appropriate SWA rate for your situation (either
    the adult dependent rate for a couple or the personal rate of SWA) is not
    taken into account. So if you are one of a <strong>couple</strong> and
    getting Carer's Allowance the amount of Carer's Allowance being paid less
    the SWA adult dependent rate is not taken into account and if you are
    <strong>single or a lone parent</strong> the amount disregarded is the rate
    of Carer's Allowance being paid less the personal rate of SWA. </li>
  <li>Any amount of <a shape="rect" href="../carers/carers_benefit.html">Carer's Benefit</a> in excess of the
    basic SWA rate for your situation (either the adult dependent rate or the
    personal rate of SWA) is not taken into account. </li>
</ul><p>Income from working as a home help with the HSE used to be disregarded for
all social assistance payments but from January 2012 this income is taken into
account. </p>

<h3>Additional Household Income Disregard </h3>

<p>If you are working or getting maintenance or have <em>additional household
income*</em> you should apply the Additional Household Income Disregard.</p>

<p>Additional Household Income Disregard is a certain amount of your household
income above the SWA rate which is not taken into account. €75 of any
<em>additional household income</em> is not taken into account. Also, 25% of
your <em>additional household income</em> over €75 is not taken into account.
There is no upper limit on the amount that can be disregarded – see
<strong>Note 3</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>*Additional household income</strong> includes income from the
following:</p>
<ul><li>Part-time employment or part-time self employment </li>
  <li>Any employment or training scheme, for example, <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/community_services_programme.html">Community

<p><strong>Note 3: Rehabilitative Earnings Disregard<br></strong>If you are working and getting Disability Allowance or Blind Pension
you can either use the Rehabilitative Earnings Disregard or the Additional
Household Income Disregard (but not both). Use whichever is in your
interest.</p>

<p>Rehabilitative Earnings Disregard is a certain amount of your income from
rehabilitative work which is not taken into account. €120 from rehabilitative
training or employment is not taken into account. In the assessment for
contribution to Mortgage Interest Supplement all earnings over €120 from
rehabilitative training or employment are taken into account and will affect
your Mortgage Interest Supplement. </p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lee213">Step 3: Deduct Supplementary Welfare
Allowance rate </h2>

<p>Subtract the basic <a shape="rect" href="supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary Welfare Allowance
(SWA)</a> weekly rate for your household from the weekly household income after
disregards that you calculated in Step 2, unless you have applied the
Additional Household Income Disregard. If you applied the Additional Household
Income Disregard in Step 2 you will have already deducted the appropriate SWA
rate for your household.</p>

<p>If you are 26 years of age or over, the basic weekly SWA rate in 2014 is:</p>

<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" border="1" width="200" summary=""><thead><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Personal rate </td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€186</td>

    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Child dependant </td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€29.80 </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>People under 26 years of age get a reduced age related rate of Supplementary
Welfare Allowance. However, there are exceptions and some people under 26 may
get a higher basic SWA rate. More information on the SWA rate for people under
26 can be found in our document on <a shape="rect" href="supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary Welfare Allowance</a>.</p>

<p><strong>You should now have calculated your weekly assessable
income.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="la8986">Step 4: Find your monthly
contribution to mortgage interest</h2>

<p><br>
Find the total amount you must pay towards your mortgage interest.<br><br>
To do this, add your weekly assessable income (this is the total figure from
Step 3) and your minimum Household Contribution (either €30 or €40 per week
– see <strong>Note 5</strong>).<br><br>
Then multiply this figure by 52 and divide by 12 to get your monthly
contribution to mortgage interest<br><br>
Weekly assessable income €<br>
Add Household Contribution €____ <br>
Total weekly contribution to mortgage interest €<br>
x 52<br>
€<br>
÷ 12 <br>
Monthly contribution to mortgage interest € <br><strong><br><br>
Note 5: Further information about the Household Contribution</strong></p>

<p>You must contribute at least €30 towards your mortgage interest. Couples
pay €40. </p>

<p>Non-dependent household members who are solely dependent on a personal
social welfare payment must also contribute at least €30. However, if <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/how_parents_income_can_affect_jobseekers_allowance.html">benefit
and privilege</a> has been assessed against your social welfare payment you
will not have to contribute €30. </p>

<p>The Department of Social Protection's representative (formerly known as the
Community Welfare Officer) can reduce the amount of Mortgage Interest
Supplement payable by an amount which in their opinion should be payable by
each non-dependent household member in employment. Custom and practice is that
the assessable income of the non-dependent household member (that is, gross
income less PRSI and travel costs to work) is divided by the appropriate rate
of SWA for their situation which is then multiplied by €30 to establish their
liability to contribute.</p>

<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" border="1" width="500" summary=""><thead><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>For example</strong></td>
    </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Your 26 year old daughter is living with
        you and earning €700 per week:</p>

        <p>€700 ÷ €186 (SWA) = €3.76</p>

        <p>Multiply 3.76 by €30 = €112.80</p>

        <p>Mortgage Interest Supplement is reduced by €112.80</p>
      </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p><br>
A couple over 65 with an income equal or less than the State Pension
(Contributory) for their situation will contribute €40 towards their mortgage
interest. A couple who both have State Pensions (Contributory) and no other
income will also contribute €40 towards their mortgage interest.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Find your Mortgage Interest Supplement</h2>

<p>To calculate your Mortgage Interest Supplement you subtract your monthly
contribution from the mortgage interest due to your lender.<br><br>
Monthly mortgage interest due to lender €<br>
Less your monthly contribution to mortgage interest - €_____<br>
Total Mortgage Interest Supplement € <br><strong><br>
Note:</strong> The Mortgage Interest Supplement payable to you is the
difference between your actual mortgage interest and your contribution to
mortgage interest, as long as the difference between the two is a reasonable
amount to meet your residential needs. Your local officer may use the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">maximum
rent limits set out for Rent Supplement</a> as a guide to decide what is a
reasonable amount. </p>

<p><strong></strong>Mortgage Interest Supplement (MIS) provides short-term
support to help you pay your mortgage interest repayments.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>From 1 January 2014, the Mortgage Interest Supplement scheme is
closed to new entrants</strong> <strong>and no new applications will be
accepted from this date.</strong> This measure does not affect current
claimants immediately (people who were getting Mortgage Interest Supplement
before 1 January 2014). The scheme will be wound down for these claimants over
a 4-year period.</p>

<p>If you are experiencing short-term mortgage difficulties your lender must
support and engage with you under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process
(MARP). The website, <a href="http://www.keepingyourhome.ie/">keepingyourhome.ie</a>, provides
comprehensive information on the services and entitlements available if you are
having difficulties making your mortgage repayments.</p>
</div>

<h3>Information for claimants getting MIS before 1 January 2014</h3>

<p>Your interest is assessed as your gross monthly interest less <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/owning_a_home/buying_a_home/mortgage_interest_relief.html">mortgage
interest relief</a> and any <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/owning_a_home/help_with_buying_a_home/mortgage_allowance_scheme.html">mortgage
allowance</a> or <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/owning_a_home/help_with_buying_a_home/affordable_housing.html">mortgage
subsidy</a> payable towards the interest part of your mortgage by the local
authority.</p>

<p>You will only get assistance with the interest portion of your mortgage
repayments. You will not get help with the portion that pays off the actual
loan and house insurance. You should contact your lender to discuss repaying
the actual loan. If you have a consolidated loan, only the interest portion of
your loan that relates to the essential purchase, repair or maintenance of your
home will be taken into account.</p>

<p>The minimum contribution for couples towards Mortgage Interest Supplement
increased from €35 to €40 per week (since 1 January 2014). This change
applies to new and existing recipients. The minimum contribution for single
people, including single people with children (currently €30), has not
changed.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p><strong>The Mortgage Interest Supplement (MIS) scheme is closed to new
entrants from 1 January 2014</strong> and will be wound down for existing
recipients over a 4-year period.</p>

<p>To qualify for Mortgage Interest Supplement you must meet the following
conditions:</p>
<ul><li>You must have made an application before 1 January 2014</li>
  <li>You must satisfy the means test</li>
  <li>You must have entered into and complied with an alternative repayment
    arrangement with your mortgage lender for at least 12 months</li>
  <li>You must have been able to afford the repayments when your loan agreement
    was first agreed</li>
  <li>The amount of your mortgage interest payable is not more than what the
    Department considers reasonable to meet your residential and other
  needs*</li>
  <li>Only the portion of your loan that relates to the essential purchase,
    repair or maintenance of your home is taken into account</li>
  <li>The size of the arrears are not greater than what the Department
    considers reasonable</li>
  <li>You are <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitually
    resident in this State</a> </li>
</ul><p>*In exceptional circumstances, the Department’s representative may award a
supplement where the amount of mortgage interest payable by a person exceeds
the amount the Department’s representative considers reasonable to meet his
or her residential and other needs. This supplement is payable for a maximum of
12 months from the date of the claim. </p>

<p>You can get MIS if your house is for sale. This means that people can engage
in selling their home and continue to be eligible for MIS, subject to the other
conditions of the MIS scheme.</p>

<p>You won’t qualify for Mortgage Interest Supplement if:</p>
<ul><li>You or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant works more than 29 hours
    a week (for exceptions to this rule - see ‘Employment and Mortgage
    Interest Supplement' below) </li>
  <li>You are involved in a trade dispute </li>
  <li>You are attending full-time education (for exceptions to this rule - see
    'Education and Mortgage Interest Supplement' below) </li>
  <li>You are unlawfully in the State </li>
  <li>You have made an application for asylum under the Refugee Act, 1996 and
    your application is awaiting final decision by the Minister for Justice and
    Equality </li>
  <li>You have made an application under the Aliens Act, 1935 to remain in the
    State and this application has not been determined </li>
  <li>You are admitted to an institution (for example, a hospital) for a period
    of in excess of 13 weeks </li>
</ul><p></p>

<h3>Employment and Mortgage Interest Supplement</h3>

<p>You will not qualify for Mortgage Interest Supplement if you are in
full-time employment. That is, employment for 29 hours per week or more. (In
the case of couples, if one of a couple is in full time employment, both are
excluded from claiming Mortgage Interest Supplement). However, there are
<strong>special retention arrangements</strong> that may allow you to keep a
proportion of your Mortgage Interest Supplement - for example, if you are
participating in a <a shape="rect" href="../../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/community_employment_scheme.html">Community
Employment Scheme</a> or getting a <a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_and_work/back_to_work_allow.html">Back to Work
Allowance</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_and_work/back_to_work_enterprise_allowance.html">Back
to Work Enterprise Allowance</a>. Your gross household income must not exceed
€317.43 per week. Back to Work Allowance, Back to Work Enterprise Allowance,
<a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
Income Supplement (FIS),</a> <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_classes.html">PRSI</a>,
reasonable travel expenses and any childcare allowance payable on certain
training courses is not taken into account in the assessment of your gross
household income. </p>

<p>Under these special retention arrangements you will continue to get 75% of
your Mortgage Interest Supplement rate during your first year in employment,
50% in the second year and 25% in the third and fourth year. After the fourth
year you will no longer be entitled to Mortgage Interest Supplement if you are
in employment. </p>

<p>These retention arrangements also apply to people who have been unemployed
for 12 months or more and who return to full-time employment and sign off their
social welfare payment. In these cases gross household income must not exceed
€317.43 per week. </p>

<h3>Education and Mortgage Interest Supplement</h3>

<p>You won’t qualify for Mortgage Interest Supplement if you are attending
full-time education. However, if you are getting Mortgage Interest Supplement
and qualify for the <a shape="rect" href="../back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">Back to
Education Allowance (BTEA)</a>, you will keep an entitlement to Mortgage
Interest Supplement. </p>

<h2>Means test for Mortgage Interest Supplement</h2>

<p>When you apply for Mortgage Interest Supplement your means will be assessed.
This will show how much of the mortgage interest you are able to pay. A means
test examines all your sources of income. However, some income is not taken
into account in the calculation of your means. You may qualify for Mortgage
Interest Supplement if your income is below a certain amount and you meet the
other conditions - see 'Rules' above.</p>

<h3>Income taken into account for Mortgage Interest Supplement</h3>
<ul><li>Net income from employment (this is gross income less PRSI and reasonable
    travel expenses. A <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_and_increase_in_your_payment_for_a_child_dependant.html">child
    dependant</a> aged 17 and under in full-time education will not have their
    income from employment taken into account for Mortgage Interest
    Supplement.) </li>
  <li>Social welfare payments (there are some exceptions - see 'Income not
    taken into account' below) </li>
  <li>Family Income Supplement </li>
  <li>Cash income (for example, maintenance) </li>
  <li>All income and the value of all property of which you may have deprived
    yourself in order to qualify </li>
  <li>Capital (for example, savings, investments and property but
    <strong>not</strong> your own home) </li>
</ul><p>The capital value of property (except your own home), savings and
investments are assessed on a weekly basis as follows:</p>

<p></p>

<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" border="1" summary=""><thead><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>Capital</strong></td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>Weekly means assessed as</strong></td>

      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€4 per €1,000</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<p><strong>Redundancy payments</strong></p>

<p>A redundancy or lump sum payment will be assessed as capital, unless it has
been used to reduce the balance of your mortgage or other outstanding loans.</p>

<h3>Income not taken into account when calculating Mortgage Interest Supplement
<br></h3>

<p>When calculating your Mortgage Interest Supplement, the following income is
not taken into account: </p>
<ul><li>An amount equal to the <a shape="rect" href="supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary Welfare Allowance
    (SWA)</a> rate for your household circumstances </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child
    Benefit</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/transport_and_disability/mobility_allowance.html">Mobility
    Allowance</a> </li>
  <li>Foster care payments from the Health Service Executive (HSE) </li>
  <li>Payments for accommodating children under the Child Care Act </li>
  <li>Income from Gaeltacht students </li>
  <li>Grants or allowances from schemes promoting the welfare of blind people
  </li>
  <li>Money received from charitable organisations, for example, St Vincent de
    Paul </li>
  <li>Compensation awarded by the Compensation Tribunal in respect of Hepatitis
    C contracted from certain blood products, to those who have disabilities
    caused by Thalidomide and to those receiving compensation under the
    Residential Institutions Redress Board </li>
  <li>Maintenance grants paid by VECs or local authorities for educational
    purposes (now replaced by the <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third_level_education/fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/maintenance_grant_schemes_for_students_on_third_level_courses.html">Student
    Grant Scheme</a>)</li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../disability_and_illness/domiciliary_care_allowance.html">Domiciliary
    Care Allowance</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../carers/respite_care_grant.html">Respite Care
    Grant</a> </li>
  <li>Guardian's Payment (Contributory) and Guardian's Payment
    (Non-Contributory)</li>
  <li>Fuel Allowance and the Living Alone Allowance</li>
  <li><strong>Pensioners:</strong> If you are aged 65 or over (or where one of
    a couple is of pensionable age) and have a combined household income
    greater than the rate of SWA appropriate to your household circumstances,
    the difference between the maximum rate of <a shape="rect" href="../older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html">State
    Pension (Contributory)</a> appropriate to your circumstance and the rate of
    SWA appropriate to your circumstances is not taken into account. </li>
  <li><strong>Carers' payments:</strong> The <a shape="rect" href="../carers/half_rate_carers_allowance.html">half-rate Carer's
    Allowance</a> is never taken into account. </li>
  <li>If you are getting <a shape="rect" href="../carers/carers_allowance.html">Carer's Allowance</a>, the amount of
    Carer's Allowance above the appropriate SWA rate for your situation (either
    the qualified adult rate for a couple or the personal rate of SWA) is not
    taken into account. So if you are one of a <strong>couple</strong> and
    getting Carer's Allowance the amount of Carer's Allowance being paid less
    the SWA qualified adult rate is not taken into account and if you are
    <strong>single or a lone parent</strong> the amount disregarded is the rate
    of Carer's Allowance being paid less the personal rate of SWA. </li>
  <li>Any amount of <a shape="rect" href="../carers/carers_benefit.html">Carer's Benefit</a> in excess of the
    basic SWA rate for your situation (either the qualified adult rate or the
    personal rate of SWA) is not taken into account. </li>
  <li><strong>Rehabilitative earnings disregard</strong>: A certain amount of
    your income from rehabilitative work is not taken into account. If you are
    getting Disability Allowance or Blind Pension, €120 from rehabilitative
    training or employment is not taken into account in the assessment for
    Mortgage Interest Supplement. Any earnings over €120 from rehabilitative
    training or employment will affect your Mortgage Interest Supplement. If
    you are earning above €120 you can be assessed using whichever disregard
    is most in your interest - either the <em>Rehabilitative earnings
    disregard</em> or the <em>Household income disregard</em> (but not both).
  </li>
  <li><strong>Household income disregard</strong>: A certain amount of your
    household income above the appropriate SWA rate is not taken into account.
    €75 of any <em>additional household income*</em> is not taken into
    account. Also, 25% of <em>additional household income</em> over €75 is
    not taken into account. There is no upper limit on the amount that can be
    disregarded. </li>
</ul><p><strong>*Additional household income</strong> is income from part-time
employment or part-time self-employment, Family Income Supplement, Community
Employment (CE), Back to Work Allowance, Back to Enterprise Allowance or FÁS
course. Maintenance is also assessed as additional household income (see
below).</p>

<h3>Maintenance and Mortgage Interest Supplement</h3>

<p>Maintenance is assessed as additional household income (see above) and
maintenance payments up to €95.23 per week are assessed in full. The
<em>household income disregard</em> (see above) applies to maintenance payments
above this amount. For example, if your only additional household income is
maintenance, all of your maintenance payment up to €95.23 per week is
assessed in full. The household income disregard of €75 applies to sums above
this, so that any maintenance between €95.23 and €170.23 is not taken into
account. 25% of all maintenance over €170.23 is also not taken into
account.</p>

<h3>Your contribution to mortgage interest (Household Contribution)</h3>

<p>You must pay at least €30 towards your mortgage interest. You may pay more
than €30 because you must also contribute any means you have towards your
mortgage interest. If you are one of a couple and are claiming Mortgage
Interest Supplement you must pay at least €40 towards your mortgage interest.

<h3>Calculating Mortgage Interest Supplement<br></h3>

<p>Calculating your Mortgage Interest Supplement can be difficult. The
Department of Social Protection's representative (formerly known as the
Community Welfare Officer) in your local health centre decides whether you are
eligible for Mortgage Interest Supplement and calculates the amount you get.
</p>

<p>The Department's representative adds together any income taken into account
in the means test for Mortgage Interest Supplement. They then subtract any
income not taken into account. Your remaining income and Household Contribution
are added together to find your contribution to your mortgage interest - see
'Means test' above. Find out more about <a shape="rect" href="calculating_mortgage_interest_supplement.html">Calculating Mortgage
Interest Supplement</a>.</p>

<p>The Mortgage Interest Supplement payable to you is the difference between
your actual mortgage interest and your contribution to mortgage interest, as
long as the difference between the two is a reasonable amount to meet your
residential needs. </p>

<p>Generally the Department's representative will ensure that your income after
paying the interest on your mortgage does not fall below a minimum level. This
level is the Supplementary Welfare Allowance minus €30 (€40 for
couples).</p>

<h2 class="further_info" id="l23f7d">Further information</h2>

<p>The new income disregards came into effect on 5 June 2007. Claims made
before 5 June 2007 were assessed using the old income disregards (see below).
</p>

<p>All existing Mortgage Interest Supplement claims in payment on 5 June 2007
will be reviewed and assessed using both the current income disegards and the
old income disregards. If you would get more Mortgage Interest Supplement using
the old income disregards, you will continue to be assessed using the old rules
until a change in circumstances triggers a review. A change in circumstances
would include, for example, a change in household income or a break in your
claim for more than 13 weeks. <br></p>

<h3>Income disregards for Mortgage Interest Supplement claims before 5 June
2007.</h3>

<p>Income from the following sources was not taken into account in the
assessment of Mortgage Interest Supplement claims made before 5 June 2007:</p>
<ul><li>Family Income Supplement </li>
  <li>Child Benefit </li>
  <li>Mobility Allowance </li>
  <li>Foster care payments from the Health Service Executive </li>

  <li>Money received from charitable organizations, for example, St Vincent de
    Paul </li>

  <li>€60 of additional income from part-time employment, including Community
    Employment Schemes. If your earnings from employment are between €60 and

    account. (For example, if you are earning €90 only €15 is taken into
    account) </li>
  <li>€60 of additional income from participation in approved training
    courses, for example, FÁS skills training courses. If your earnings are
    between €60 and €90 only half of your earnings between €60 and €90
    is taken into account. For example, if you are earning €90 only €15 is
    taken into account </li>
  <li>€120 from rehabilitative training or employment if you are in receipt
    of Disability Allowance. Any earnings over €120 from rehabilitative
    training or employment will affect your Rent Supplement </li>
  <li>If you are on a One-Parent Family Payment, up to €95.23 of maintenance
    payments is deemed to be for rent. Half of any amount above this is taken
    into account as means, and will affect your One-Parent Family Payment. The
    first €95.23 of any maintenance you receive is taken into account when
    calculating your Rent Supplement, but maintenance above €95.23 euro up to
    a limit of €155.23 is disregarded. Half of any maintenance you get
    between €155.23 and €185.23 is taken into account. All maintenance
    above €185.23 is taken into account when calculating your Rent
    Supplement. </li>

<p>The Blind Pension is a means-tested payment paid to blind and visually
impaired people who are <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitually
resident</a> in Ireland. The payment is made by the Department of Social
Protection. To qualify for the Pension you must supply an eye test from an
opthalmic surgeon to verify your visual impairment.</p>

<p>The payment is made up of a personal rate for you and extra amounts for a
qualified adult and any child dependants (see 'Rates' below). If you are
awarded a Blind Pension, you may also qualify for the <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/health_related_benefits_and_entitlements/blind_welfare_allowance.html">Blind
Welfare Allowance paid by the HSE</a>. </p>

<p>You will automatically get a <a shape="rect" href="../extra_social_welfare_benefits/free_travel.html">Free Travel Pass</a>
and a Companion Free Travel Pass. (A Free Travel Pass allows you to travel on
State public transport in Ireland for free. A Companion Free Travel Pass allows
your companion aged 16 or over to also travel for free). You may also qualify
for other benefits such as the <a shape="rect" href="../extra_social_welfare_benefits/living_alone_allowance.html">Living
Alone Increase</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="../extra_social_welfare_benefits/household_benefits_package.html">Household
Benefits Package</a>. <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html"></a>
</p>

<p>Blind Pension is a <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">taxable
source of income.</a> </p>

<h3>One-Parent Family Payment and Blind Pension</h3>

<p>Blind Pension is payable with One-Parent Family Payment (OFP). This means
that a person who qualifies for OFP and Blind Pension can get both payments at
the full rate. People who qualify for Blind Pension are exempted from the age
conditions for OFP. This means that you can claim both Blind Pension and OFP
(and any IQCs payable with both Blind Pension and OFP) together until your
youngest child is 16 years of age. This provision is in effect from April
2015.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you are blind or have a serious visual impairment before reaching 18
years, you should make your claim 4 months before your 18th birthday. (If you
are aged 16-18, you may qualify for <a shape="rect" href="disability_allowance.html">Disability Allowance</a>.) Blind Pension is
not paid after you turn 66. </p>

<p>If you become blind or seriously visually impaired after your 18th birthday,
you should apply as soon as possible. This is important as <span>payment can
only be made from the date your application is received</span>. If you require
full-time care, the person looking after you may qualify for a <a shape="rect" href="../carers/carers_allowance.html">Carer's Allowance</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../carers/carers_benefit.html">Carer's Benefit</a>. </p>

<h3>The means test</h3>

<p>The main items that are counted as means include:</p>
<ul><li>Any cash income that you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant may
    have (including income from employment)</li>
  <li>The value of savings, investments, shares, land etc. </li>
  <li>Any property you may have </li>
  <li>Maintenance paid to you if you are deserted, separated or a civil partner
    not living with the other civil partner. </li>
</ul><p>The following items are not counted as means for Blind Pension:</p>
<ul><li>Your own home </li>
  <li>Any payment made by the Department of Social Protection</li>
  <li>The value of the first €20,000 of capital assets (for example, savings)
  </li>
  <li>Money received from a recognised charitable organisation (excluding
    public or local authority) </li>
  <li>The maintenance part of a <a href="../../../education/third_level_education/fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/maintenance_grant_schemes_for_students_on_third_level_courses.html">student
    grant from SUSI</a> paid to you, a qualified adult or child dependant(s)
    for certain courses </li>
  <li>Income up to a certain limit from <a href="../social_welfare_payments_and_work/disability_payments_and_work.html">rehabilitative
    employment</a> </li>
  <li>Income from rehabilitative training </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="domiciliary_care_allowance.html">Domiciliary Care
    Allowance</a></li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child
    Benefit</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary
    Welfare Allowance</a> or foster care allowances </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/transport_and_disability/mobility_allowance.html">Mobility
    Allowance</a> from the Department of Health</li>
  <li>Blind Welfare Allowance paid by the HSE</li>
</ul><h3>Work and Blind Pension</h3>

<p>You can earn €120 per week from rehabilitative employment before these
earnings affect your payment. If you earn more than €120 per week from
rehabilitative work, 50% of your earnings between €120 and €350 are not
taken into account in the Blind Pension means test. All your earnings over
€350 are assessed as income and your entitlement to Blind Pension will be
reduced in line with <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/1084_Illness-disability-and-caring.aspx">the
appropriate reduced rates of payment for Blind Pension</a>. </p>

<p>If you have income from work that is not rehabilitative the following
disregards apply:</p>
<ul><li>€400 of your annual earnings</li>
  <li>€265 of your annual earning if your spouse/partner is living with you
    or is wholly or mainly maintained by you.</li>
  <li>€133 of your annual earnings for each of your qualified children under
    age 18 (or under age 22 if in full time education).</li>
</ul><p>There are no disregards for your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant's
earnings. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">

<p>There are a number of social welfare payments for people who are sick or who
have a disability. Payments are made either by the Department of Social
Protection or the Health Service Executive (HSE). To qualify for a social
welfare payment because you are sick or have a disability you must be certified
as sick or disabled by a doctor.</p>

<p>You can qualify for certain payments if you are sick for just a short time.
For other payments you need to show that you have an illness or disability that
will last longer than one year. Some social welfare disability payments are
based on your <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">PRSI
contributions</a>. If you do not have enough PRSI contributions you may qualify
for a similar social assistance payment, however, you must be <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitually
resident</a> and pass a <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/means_test.html">means
test</a>. </p>

<p>Illness Benefit is intended for those with a short-term illness. Invalidity
Pension is a long-term payment. <a shape="rect" href="disability_benefit.html">Illness Benefit</a> and <a shape="rect" href="invalidity_pension.html">Invalidity Pension</a> are both social insurance
payments based on your PRSI contributions. </p>

<p><a href="partial_capacity_benefit.html">Partial Capacity Benefit</a> is a
scheme which allows you to return to work (if you have reduced capacity to
work) and continue to receive a payment from the Department of Social
Protection. To qualify for Partial Capacity Benefit you need to be in receipt
of either Illness Benefit (for a minimum of 6 months) or Invalidity Pension.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="disability_allowance.html">Disability Allowance</a> is
a long-term social assistance payment for those aged 16-65 with a disability
expected to last at least one year. <a shape="rect" href="blind_persons_pension.html">Blind Pension</a> is also a long-term social
assistance payment. If you are blind or have low vision and you are getting
Blind Pension or Disability Allowance you may also qualify for <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/health_related_benefits_and_entitlements/blind_welfare_allowance.html">Blind
Welfare Allowance</a>.</p>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="occupational_injuries_benefit_overview.html">Occupational Injuries
Benefit Scheme</a> applies to work related injuries and diseases. If you are
injured at work (or traveling directly to or from it) or have contracted a
disease due to the type of work you do you may qualify for benefits under this
scheme.</p>

<p>If you are sick and do not qualify for any payment you may be eligible for
<a shape="rect" href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary
Welfare Allowance</a>. </p>

<p>Generally, social welfare payments are made up of a personal payment for
yourself and extra amounts for your dependent spouse, civil partner or
cohabitant and your dependent children.</p>

<h3>Other payments</h3>

<p>If you are getting a social welfare payment you may qualify for additional
financial support because of your illness or disability, for example, under the
<a shape="rect" href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/">Supplementary Welfare
Allowance Scheme</a> you can apply for <a shape="rect" href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/diet_and_heating_supplements.html">a
Heating Supplement</a>, if you have exceptional heating expenses due to
ill-health or infirmity. </p>

<p>You could be eligible for the <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/health_related_benefits_and_entitlements/long_term_illness_scheme.html">Long
Term Illness Scheme</a> or a <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical
card</a> or a <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/gp_visit_cards.html">GP Visit
Card</a>. Apply to your Local Health Office in the Health Service Executive. <a shape="rect" href="../../../health/health_services_for_people_with_disabilities/">Find out
more about health services for people with disabilities</a>.</p>

<p>There are <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/transport_and_disability/">concessions for
disabled drivers and passengers</a> and <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/housing_grants_and_schemes/housing_adaptation_grant_for_people_with_disability.html">local

<h3>Recovery of personal injury-related benefits and assistance</h3>

<p>From 1 August 2014, under the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Recovery-of-Benefits-and-Assistance.aspx">Recovery
of Certain Benefits and Assistance (RBA) Scheme</a> the Department of Social
Protection can recover the value of certain illness-related social welfare
payments from compensation awards made following non-fatal personal injuries
claims. The value of the social welfare payments are recovered from the
compensator and not from the injured person who is getting a social welfare
payment.</p>

<p>The payments that can be recovered under the RBA Scheme are:</p>
<ul><li><a href="disability_benefit.html">Illness Benefit</a></li>
  <li><a href="partial_capacity_benefit.html">Partial Capacity
  Benefit</a></li>
  <li><a href="injury_benefit.html">Injury Benefit</a></li>
  <li><a href="occupational_injuries_benefit_overview.html">Incapacity
    Supplement</a></li>
  <li><a href="invalidity_pension.html">Invalidity Pension</a></li>
  <li><a href="disability_allowance.html">Disability Allowance</a></li>
</ul><p>Compensation payments may be made as a result of a court or Injuries Board
order or as a result of an agreement between the 2 parties. In both cases <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Recovery-of-Benefits-and-Assistance-scheme.aspx#_Toc393459075">a
statement of recoverable benefits and assistance</a> must be requested by a
compensator or the Injuries Board from the RBA Section in the Department of
Social Protection using the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/Recovery-of-Benefits-and-Assistance.pdf">RBA01
form (pdf)</a>.</p>

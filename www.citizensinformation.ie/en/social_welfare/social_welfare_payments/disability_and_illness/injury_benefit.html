<p>Injury Benefit is one of the benefits available under the <a shape="rect" href="occupational_injuries_benefit_overview.html">Occupational Injuries
Benefit Scheme</a>. It is a weekly payment made to you if you are unfit for
work due to:</p>
<ul><li>An accident at work </li>
  <li>An accident while travelling (on an unbroken journey) directly to or from
    work </li>
  <li>An occupational disease </li>
</ul><p>An occupational disease is a disease that you contract in the course of your
employment or due to the work you do, for example, from contact with physical
or chemical agents. The Department of Social Protection has a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Publications/sw33/Pages/Descriptionofeachdiseaseorinjuryandtypeofemploymentforwhichitisprescribed.aspx">list
of Prescribed Occupational Diseases</a>. </p>

<p>To get Injury Benefit you must be unfit for work for more than 6 days as a
result of the accident or disease (excluding Sundays or paid holiday leave).
However, even if you are not unfit for work for more than 6 days you are
entitled to a declaration that an occupational accident occurred. This
safeguards your future rights to benefits under the Occupational Injuries
Benefit Scheme (as not all work accidents and diseases result immediately in
illness or disablement).</p>
</div>

<p><a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">Injury
Benefit is taxable</a> but you are unlikely to pay tax if it is your only
income.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Social insurance (PRSI) contributions</h3>

<p>In general, people in employment insurable at PRSI Class A, D, J or M are
covered for Injury Benefit. For people insurable at class M, only employees
under 16 years of age are covered.</p>

<p>Civil Servants recruited prior to April 1995 and insured at Class B do not
qualify for Injury Benefit but may be entitled to a declaration that an
occupational accident occurred and qualify for other benefits under the
Occupational Injuries Benefits Scheme.</p>

<p>You do not have to be insured under Class A, D, J or M for any particular
length of time to qualify for Injury Benefit. You will qualify if you are unfit
for work because of an accident at work or an occupational disease. Your
illness or incapacity must last for more than 6 days (excluding Sundays or paid
holiday leave).</p>

<p></p>

<h3>How long is Injury Benefit paid?</h3>

<p>Injury Benefit is not paid for the first 6 days of your illness or
incapacity. This was extended to 6 days from 3 days from 6 January 2014.
Payment can be made for up to 26 weeks starting from the date of your accident
or development of the disease. </p>

<p>If you are still unable to work after 26 weeks, you may be entitled to <a shape="rect" href="disability_benefit.html"><u>Illness Benefit</u></a>, <a shape="rect" href="disability_allowance.html"><u>Disability Allowance</u></a>
or <a shape="rect" href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html"><u>Supplementary
Welfare Allowance</u></a>. You may also be entitled to <a shape="rect" href="disablement_benefit.html"><u>Disablement Benefit</u></a> if you suffer a
loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of the accident or disease.
Alternatively, if you do not qualify for Illness Benefit or another social
welfare payment and you are getting Disablement Benefit, you may be eligible
for Incapacity Supplement. </p>

<p>If you are receiving <a href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
Income Supplement (FIS)</a> and cannot work because of an occupational illness
or disease, payment of FIS may continue with Injury Benefit for up to 36 days
(6 weeks). Similarly if you are getting <a href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/back_to_work_family_dividend.html">Back
to Work Family Dividend</a>, payment of BTWFD may continue with Injury Benefit
for 36 days (6 weeks).</p>

<h3>Rehabilitative work and training</h3>

<p>You may take part in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/OperationalGuidelines/Pages/oib_injuryb.aspx#disq">training
or part-time work which is rehabilitative</a> and get Injury Benefit.</p>

<p>If you wish to take part in a course of training or to undertake
rehabilitative work, you must get prior written permission from the Department
of Social Protection.</p>

<p>You do not need prior written permission to undertake:</p>
<ul><li>light work for which no payment is, or would normally be, payable</li>
  <li>work which is done as part of treatment while you are in hospital or
    other similar institution and the earnings do not exceed €50.00 per
  week</li>
  <li>work under a scheme which is considered charitable in character where the
    earnings do not exceed €50.00 per week</li>
</ul><h3>Partial Capacity Benefit</h3>

<p>If you have received Injury Benefit for the maximum period of 6 months and
have transferred to Illness Benefit, you can apply for <a href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/partial_capacity_benefit.html">Partial
Capacity Benefit</a>.</p>

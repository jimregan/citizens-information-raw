<p>Disability Allowance is a weekly allowance paid to people with a disability.
You can get Disability Allowance from 16 years of age. If you are in education
when you turn 16, you can continue to attend school.</p>
</div>

<p>If you qualify for Disability Allowance you may also get <a shape="rect" href="../extra_social_welfare_benefits/">extra social welfare benefits with
your payment</a> and other <a shape="rect" href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/">supplementary welfare payments</a>.

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To qualify for Disability Allowance (DA) you must: </p>
<ul><li>Have an injury, disease or physical or mental disability that has
    continued or may be expected to continue for at least one year </li>
  <li>As a result of this disability be <em>substantially restricted</em> in
    undertaking work that would otherwise be suitable for a person of your age,
    experience and qualifications </li>
  <li>Be aged between 16 and 66. When you reach 66 years of age you no longer
    qualify for DA, but you are assessed for a State pension. </li>
  <li>Satisfy a <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/means_test.html">means
    test</a> </li>
  <li>Satisfy the <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitual
    residence condition</a>. </li>
</ul><h3>Residential care</h3>

<p>If you are getting Disability Allowance and go into hospital or residential
care you will continue to get your payment as long as you meet the qualifying
conditions.</p>

<p>If you were not getting Disability Allowance before living in residential
care you can get Disability Allowance if you meet the qualifying conditions.
</p>

<h3>Means test</h3>

<p>Disability Allowance is a means-tested payment. To get the allowance your
total assessed means must be below a certain amount. The main items that count
as means are:</p>
<ul><li>Cash income that you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant may
    have. More information is available in our document about <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/cash_income_not_included_in_the_social_welfare_means_test.html">cash
    income not included in the means test</a>. </li>
  <li>Capital, for example, the value of savings, investments, shares, any
    property you may have (other than your own home). However, the first
    €50,000 of any capital you have is not taken into account. More
    information is available in our document about <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/how_to_assess_your_means_from_capital_for_social_welfare_payments.html">capital
    and social welfare payments</a>. </li>
  <li>Maintenance paid to you. More information is available in our document
    about <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/maintenance_and_social_welfare_payments.html">how
    maintenance is assessed as means</a>. </li>
</ul><h3>Income from the sale of your home</h3>

<p>The proceeds of the sale of the house <span>up to €190,500 </span>may not
be taken into account when assessing your means if you sell your home and:</p>
<ul><li>Move to more suitable accommodation (you can either buy or rent) </li>
  <li>Move in with someone who is caring for you and getting a carer's payment
  </li>
  <li>Move to sheltered or special housing in the voluntary, co-operative,
    statutory or private sectors </li>
  <li>Move into a private nursing home that is registered under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0023/index.html">Health
    (Nursing Homes) Act 1990</a> </li>
</ul><p>If you are living in premises, part of which is a business and part of which
is used for accommodation, only the proceeds that relate to the part of the
premises that has been used for accommodation are not taken into account.</p>

<h3>Income from work</h3>

<p>You can do rehabilitative work (which includes self-employment) and earn up
to €120 per week (after deduction of PRSI, any pension contributions and
union dues) without your payment being affected. You notify the Department of
Social Protection before you start work. </p>

<p>50% of your earnings between €120 and €350 will not be taken into
account in the Disability Allowance means test. Any earnings over €350 are
fully assessed in the means test. </p>

<p>People on Disability Allowance are eligible for <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/national_internship_scheme.html">JobBridge
- the National Internship Scheme</a>. </p>

<p>More information is available in our document <a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_and_work/disability_payments_and_work.html">Disability
payments and work</a>.</p>

<h3>Payments for dependants</h3>

<p>If you are married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting, you may get an
increase in your payment for your <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">spouse
or partner</a>. You may also get an increase in your payment for <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_and_increase_in_your_payment_for_a_child_dependant.html"><u>dependant
children</u></a>. </p>

<p>If you have children living with you and you are single, widowed, separated
or a civil partner who is not living with the other civil partner, you may get
an increase in your payment for the person who is caring for your child,
provided the person is aged 16 or over, living with and being supported by you.
</p>

<h3>Income from spouse's, civil partner's or cohabitant's work</h3>

<p>If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant works it can affect your
Disability Allowance.</p>

<p>Your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant's weekly earnings (from employment,
including rehabilitiative employment) are assessed as follows: </p>

<p>Weekly earnings are gross earnings less <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">PRSI</a>,
superannuation (pension payments) and union dues. </p>

<p>€20 per day (up to a maximum of €60) from work is deducted from your
spouse, civil partner or cohabitant's average weekly earnings and then 60% of
the balance is assessed as weekly means. The weekly means is then deducted from
the combined total of your personal rate of Disability Allowance and the
maximum Increase for a Qualified Adult and any Increases for Qualified Children
(if applicable). This formula does not apply to income from self-employment
(all income from self-employment is assessed and there are no disregards). </p>

<p>If you were getting Disability Allowance before 26 September 2007 and you
were still in payment on 26 September 2007, your spouse, civil partner or
cohabitant's earnings will be assessed under the new means assessment to find
out whether you are better off. If you would get a greater amount of Disability
Allowance on the previous assessment then you will continue to be assessed
using the previous method of calculating means from employment.</p>

<p>If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant's means have changed, for any
reason, since 26 September 2007, you cannot apply the previous method of
calculating means from employment.</p>
</div>

<h3>Medical assessment</h3>

<p>You are required to have your own doctor complete a medical report, which is
part of the application form, on your medical condition. This report is
reviewed by one of the Department’s Medical Assessors.</p>

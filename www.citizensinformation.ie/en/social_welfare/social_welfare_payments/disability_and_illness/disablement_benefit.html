<p>Disablement Benefit is a benefit under the <a shape="rect" href="occupational_injuries_benefit_overview.html">Occupational Injuries
Scheme</a>. It can be paid to you if you suffer a loss of physical or mental
faculty because of an accident at work, an accident travelling directly to or
from work, or a prescribed disease contracted at work. Payment is only made
where the level of disablement following the accident or disease is assessed at
15% or more. </p>

<p>Where the level of disablement is assessed at 20% or more the benefit is
paid by weekly or 4-weekly pension (called Disablement Pension). However, where
the rate is assessed at less than 20%, the benefit is paid as a lump sum
(called Disablement Gratuity).The size of the lump sum will vary depending on
the degree of disablement and how long you are reasonably expected to be
disabled. </p>

<p>If you are getting Disablement Benefit and you are unfit for work, you may
qualify for Illness Benefit based on your <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social
insurance contributions</a> (PRSI). If you do not qualify for <a shape="rect" href="disability_benefit.html">Illness Benefit</a> or another social welfare
payment, you may get Incapacity Supplement.</p>

<h3>Incapacity Supplement</h3>

<p>This is an extra supplement with Disablement Pension. You may get Incapacity
Supplement if you are permanently incapable of work as a result of an
occupational accident or disease <strong>and</strong> do not qualify for
another social welfare payment such as Illness Benefit. You may get an increase
in your payment for an <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">adult
dependant</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_and_increase_in_your_payment_for_a_child_dependant.html">child
dependants</a>. Incapacity Supplement is not payable outside the EU. If you do
not qualify for a State Pension at age 66, you can remain on Incapacity
Supplement.</p>

<h3>Constant Attendance Allowance</h3>

<p>This allowance can be paid weekly as an increase to Disablement Pension if
you are so seriously disabled as to need someone (a relative or some other
person) to help you daily at home to attend to your personal needs for a period
of at least 6 months. You must be getting a Disablement Pension of 50% or over.
Entitlement to Constant Attendance Allowance is based on the recommendation of
the Department’s medical advisor. You will not get the allowance during any
period you are in a hospital or similar institution. Constant Attendance
Allowance is not payable outside the EU.</p>
</div>

<h3>Taxation of payments under the OIB Scheme</h3>

<p>Disablement Benefit, Incapacity Supplement and Constant Attendance Allowance
are <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">taxable
sources of income</a> but you are unlikely to pay tax if they are your only
income. Disablement Gratuity is <em>not</em> taxable. <br></p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You may get Disablement Benefit if you suffer a loss of physical or mental
faculty because of: </p>
<ul><li>An accident at work </li>
  <li>An accident while travelling (on an unbroken journey) directly to or from
    work </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/OperationalGuidelines/Pages/prescribeddiseases.aspx">A
    prescribed occupational disease</a></li>
</ul><h3>Loss of physical or mental faculty</h3>

<p>The extent of disablement is assessed following an examination by a Medical
Assessor who will assess the extent of your loss of faculty as a result of your
occupational accident or disease. 'Loss of faculty' means your inability to
enjoy a normal lifestyle because of the loss or partial loss of your ordinary
physical or mental abilities as a result of your occupational injury or
disease. In assessing the degree of loss of faculty, account is taken of how
your current physical and mental condition compares to your pre-accident state
of health and how you compare with a healthy person of the same age and sex.</p>

<p>Examples of assessments are as follows:</p>

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="1" summary="Examples of assessments are as follows:"><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>Injury</strong></td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>Disablement</strong></td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Loss of both hands</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">100%</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Loss of one eye</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">40%</td>

    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Loss of index finger</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">14%</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<h3>PRSI contributions</h3>

<p>In order to qualify for Disablement Benefit, you must have been in
employment on or after 1 May 1967, that was insurable at PRSI Class A, B, D, J
or M, at the time that you sustained the accident or disease.</p>

<p>(Under the Occupational Injuries Scheme, <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/government_departments/the_civil_service.html">civil
servants</a> insured at PRSI Class B are not eligible for Disablement Benefit
for the first 26 weeks after the date of the accident. This is because for this
26 week period, civil servants continue to be paid by their parent Department.
After this 26-week period, a civil servant is paid half their salary and
half-rate Disablement Benefit). </p>

<h3>Declaring an occupational injury</h3>

<p>All work accidents or occupational diseases may not result immediately in
illness or disablement. If you are not immediately incapacitated but wish to
<strong>safeguard your future right to Disablement Benefit</strong>, you should
notify your employer about the accident or disease and apply for a declaration
that your accident or disease was an occupational one. This should be done
without delay. Declaration forms are available from the Injury Benefit Section
of Department of Social Protection (see 'Where to apply' below). </p>

<p>If your disablement occurs at a later stage, you should claim within 3
months of becoming aware of it.</p>

<h3>Disablement Benefit</h3>

<p>Your payment depends on the degree of your disablement, which is medically
assessed. For assessments of less than 20%, Disablement Benefit will normally
be a lump sum (gratuity). The size of the lump sum will vary depending on the
degree of disablement and how long you are expected to be disabled. For
assessments of 20% upwards, a pension is payable.</p>

<p><strong>From 17 March 2017, if you have 100% disablement</strong>, your
maximum personal pension is €224 (previously €219). </p>

<p>A lump sum may be payable, up to a maximum of €15,670 (previously
€15,320)</p>

<p><strong>If you have between 20-90% disablement</strong>, your maximum
personal pension is as follows:</p>

<p><strong>If you are unable to work after the accident or disease</strong>,
you should first claim Injury Benefit, which can be paid for up to 26 weeks
after the accident or the onset of the disease. Before your <a shape="rect" href="injury_benefit.html">Injury Benefit</a> payment finishes, you should
claim Disablement Benefit if you suffer from loss of faculty as a result of
your accident or disease. If you do not claim in time, you may lose some
benefit. You should claim within 3 months of your Injury Benefit claim
ending.</p>

<p><strong>If you are able to work after the accident or disease</strong>, you
should claim Disablement Benefit as soon as possible and within 3 months of the
date of the accident or the onset of the disease. Payment is made from the
fourth day of your disablement. If you do not claim in time, you may lose some
benefit. You should claim within 3 months of the date of your accident or the
onset of the disease.</p>

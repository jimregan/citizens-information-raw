<p>The Treatment Benefit Scheme is a scheme run by the Department of Social
Protection (DSP) that provides dental, optical and aural services to qualified
people. </p>

<p>The Treatment Benefit Scheme is available to insured workers and retired
people who have the required number of <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">PRSI
contributions</a>. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">Medical card
holders</a> are legally entitled to more extensive <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/dental_aural_and_optical_services/dental_services.html">dental</a>,
<a shape="rect" href="/en/health/dental_aural_and_optical_services/optometric_and_ophthalmic_services.html">ophthalmic
</a>and <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/dental_aural_and_optical_services/aural_services.html">aural
services</a> from the <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/how_health_is_organised/health_boards.html">Health Service
Executive (HSE)</a> but, in practice, the availability of these services varies
from area to area. </p>

<p>From 27 March 2017, the Treatment Benefit Scheme has been extended to also
cover self-employed people who pay Class S PRSI. You should contact the DSP
(see ‘Where to apply’ below) or your treatment provider to check your
eligibility before proceeding with any treatment.</p>

<p>Under the Treatment Benefit Scheme, you may qualify for: </p>
<ul><li>Dental benefit </li>
  <li>Optical benefit </li>
  <li>Hearing aids</li>
</ul><h3>Treatment Benefit in the EU</h3>

<p>If you choose to have treatment in another EU member state, the Department
will pay an amount equivalent to the rate paid for similar treatments carried
out in Ireland or, the amount actually paid for the treatment - <span>whichever
is the lower</span>. You <span>must still have the qualifying PRSI
contributions</span>. </p>

<p>Contact the Treatment Benefit Section before you travel to get an
application form and details of the amounts the Department will pay.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Contribution conditions</h3>

<p>You must have paid Class A, E, P, H or S social insurance contributions. </p>

<p>The amount of social insurance you need depends on your age.</p>

<p><span>(<strong>1) Aged under 21</strong></span></p>

<p>If you are aged under 21, you may qualify if you have paid at least 39
contributions at any time. </p>

<p><span><strong>(2) Aged 21-24</strong></span></p>

<p>Between these ages you may qualify if you have paid at least 39
contributions <em>and</em></p>
<ul><li>At least 39 paid or credited in the governing contribution year (2015 is
    the governing contribution year for claims made in 2017) and 13 paid
    contributions in a recent contribution year <strong>or</strong></li>
  <li>26 paid contributions in each of the second and third last contribution
    years. For claims made in 2017, the second last contribution year is 2015
    and the third last contribution year is 2014. </li>
</ul><p><span><strong>(3) Aged 25-65</strong></span></p>

<p>From the age of 25 onwards, you must have at least 260 paid contributions
<em>and</em></p>
<ul><li>At least 39 paid or credited contributions in the governing contribution
    year (2015 is the governing contribution year for claims made in 2017) and
    13 paid contributions in a recent contribution year <strong>or</strong></li>
  <li>26 paid contributions in each of the second and third last contribution
    years. For claims made in 2017, the second last contribution year is 2015
    and the third last contribution year is 2014. </li>
</ul><p><span><strong>(4) Aged 66+</strong></span></p>

<p>There are special rules for people aged 66 and over. Basically, you must
have 260 contributions paid at any time, you must have 39 paid or credited in
any of the two contribution years before reaching age 66 and you must have 13
paid contributions in a recent contribution year (before reaching age 66). </p>

<p>There are, however, a number of exceptions to this:</p>

<p>If you reached 66 before 6 July 1992, you do not need 13 recently paid
contributions</p>

<p>If you reached age 66 before 1 October 1987, you need 156 paid contributions
instead of 260; if you reached 66 between 1 October 1987 and 6 July 1992, you
need 208 paid contributions.</p>

<p>If you are getting a <a shape="rect" href="../older_and_retired_people/">State pension</a> the PRSI contribution
requirements vary according to age as follows: </p>

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="1" summary="PRSI contributions required by people aged 66 and over who wish to claim Treatment Benefit  "><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>If you were:</strong></td>

    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Aged 66 before 1 October 1987</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">156 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work

        before you reached age 66.</td>

    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Aged 66 on or after 6 July 1992</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work
        and 39 weeks paid or credited in either of the last 2 complete tax
        years before you reached age 66.</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>If you satisfy these conditions when you reach pension age, you will remain
qualified for life.</p>

<h3>The recent contribution year rule for those under 66</h3>

<p>In general, you must have 13 paid contributions in a recent contribution
year. This may be the same year as you have the 39 paid or credited
contributions and the 13 paid may be part of those 39. It may also be either of
the two preceding contribution years or a subsequent year. </p>

<p>If you are receiving any of the following payments, you do not need to have
13 recently paid contributions:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="invalidity_pension.html">Invalidity Pension</a>
  </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../carers/carers_allowance.html">Carer's
    Allowance</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="disability_benefit.html">Illness Benefit</a> (for
    12 months or more) </li>
  <li>Long-term <a shape="rect" href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
    Allowance</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../unemployed_people/preta.html">Pre-Retirement
    Allowance</a> </li>
  <li>A combination of <a shape="rect" href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker's Benefit</a>
    and Jobseeker's Allowance for at least one year </li>
</ul><p>You do not need to have 13 recently paid contributions if you are on a <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/community_employment_scheme.html">Community
Employment Scheme</a>, a Back to Work Scheme, a Vocational Training
Opportunities Scheme or a Community Employment Development Programme.</p>

<p>If you are aged 55 or over and are not getting any payment but are signing
on, you don't need the 13 recently paid contributions either.</p>

<h3>Qualified at 60</h3>

<p>If you qualify for benefit at age 60, you retain that entitlement for life.
If you are aged between 61 and 65 and you do not meet the qualifying conditions
at age 60, you must satisfy the qualifying conditions for the 25-65 age group.
However, if you have retired on grounds of ill health or you are considered to
be unemployed, you can apply for Illness Benefit or Jobseeker's Benefit,
subject to satisfying the statutory conditions. Your entitlement to these
benefits may also lead to your being awarded credited contributions, which can
be taken into account to extend coverage for treatment benefits for further
periods.</p>

<h3>Spouse, civil partner or cohabitant</h3>

<p>A spouse, civil partner or cohabitant may, of course, qualify in their own
right if they have enough social insurance contributions. </p>

<p>If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant does not have enough social
insurance contributions he/she may still qualify for Treatment Benefit on your
social insurance record. To do this, you must qualify for Treatment Benefit and
your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant must be dependent on you.</p>

<p>A dependent spouse, civil partner or cohabitant must: </p>
<ul><li>Have a gross income of €100 or less per week </li>
  <li>Earn more than €100 per week and be dependent on you before entering or
    resuming insurable employment (at Class A, E, H, P or S) </li>
  <li><span>Not</span> get a social welfare payment (except Disablement
    Pension, Supplementary Welfare Allowance, Carer's Benefit or Child Benefit)
  </li>
  <li>Have a Carer's Allowance or State Pension (Non-Contributory) and be
    dependent on you immediately before getting the Allowance or Pension </li>
</ul><p>If an insured person dies and the dependent spouse or civil partner was
entitled to benefit at the time of the death, they retain entitlement for as
long as they remain widowed or a surviving civil partner.</p>

<h3>Dental Benefit </h3>

<p>Under this scheme, the Department pays the full cost of an oral examination
once a calendar year. The examination is provided by private dentists who are
on the Department of Social Protection's panel. <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/dentists.aspx">Lists of dentists on the
panel are available on welfare.ie</a>. Most dentists are on the panel so you
should not have any difficulty finding one. The dentist will have the
application forms. These forms require details such as your <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">Personal
Public Service Number (PPS number)</a>. If you are a dependent spouse or civil
partner, you should give the PPS number of the insured person.</p>

<h3>Optical Benefit </h3>

<p>The Treatment Benefit Scheme entitles you to a free eyesight test. However,
sight tests for VDUs, <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/driver_licensing/full_driving_licence.html">driving
licences</a>, etc., are not covered under the scheme. The examination is
provided by <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Opticians-list-page-for-the-website-of-the-Department-of-Soc.aspx">opticians</a>/<a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Ophthalmologists-list-page-for-the-website-of-the-Department.aspx">optometrists</a>
who have a contract with the Department of Social Protection. </p>

<p>If you need contact lenses on medical grounds, the Department will pay half
the cost up to a maximum of €500 provided you have a doctor's recommendation.
This applies to a small number of eye conditions that make wearing glasses
impossible. Disposable lenses are not covered under the scheme. Contact lenses
are not available on purely optical or cosmetic grounds. </p>

<h3>Hearing aids</h3>

<p>Hearing aids may be provided by <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Medical-Appliance-Suppliers.aspx">suppliers
who have a contract with the Department of Social Protection</a>. The
Department pays half the cost of a hearing aid subject to a fixed maximum of
€500 for each hearing aid every 4 years. It also pays half the cost of
repairs to aids. </p>

<h3>Tax relief</h3>

<p>You may get <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/taxation_and_medical_expenses.html">tax
relief on certain non-routine dental treatments</a>.</p>

<h3>Treatment Benefit Scheme and EU Regulations</h3>

<p>If you were previously insurably employed in a country covered by EU
Regulations and you do not qualify on your Irish PRSI record, your social
insurance record in the other EU country may be used to help you qualify for
Treatment Benefit. You must have paid at least one reckonable PRSI contribution
(Classes A, E, H, P and S) since your return to Ireland.<br></p>

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>You may get <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Publications/SW119/Pages/1WhatisIllnessBenefit.aspx">Illness
Benefit</a> from the Department of Social Protection if you cannot work because
you are sick or ill. You must be aged under 66, covered by the appropriate
class of <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social
insurance (PRSI)</a> and satisfy the PRSI conditions. </p>

<p>Illness Benefit is not linked to your employer's policy on pay for sick
leave (your employer can decide their own policy on sick pay and sick leave).
More information is available in our document about <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/sick_leave.html">sick
leave and employment</a>.</p>

<p>Whether your employer pays you or not while you are out sick from work, you
should claim Illness Benefit from the first day of your illness – see
“Rules” below. If you get sick pay from work, you should ask your employer
what administrative arrangements are in place while you are claiming Illness
Benefit.</p>

<p>If your income is too low to meet your needs, while you are waiting for a
decision on your claim for Illness Benefit, you may be entitled to <a href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">basic
Supplementary Welfare Allowance</a>, which is a means-tested payment.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You must apply for Illness Benefit within 7 days of becoming ill. No payment
is made for the first 6 days of illness which are known as waiting days. (Note
that Sunday is not counted as a waiting day.) The only time that the 6 waiting
days are not applied is if you were getting certain other social welfare
payments within 3 days of the start of your illness.</p>

<p>Whether you qualify for payment or not, you should always submit a claim for
Illness Benefit when you are certified unfit for work. You may be<a></a>
entitled to PRSI credited contributions for each week you are ill and these
could help you qualify for future social welfare payments.</p>

<h3>Social insurance (PRSI) contributions </h3>

<p>To qualify for payment of Illness Benefit you must satisfy the following
<em>two</em> conditions: </p>
<ol><li>You must have at least 104 weeks of PRSI contributions paid since you
    first started work 
    <p><span><strong>and</strong> <em>either</em> </span></p>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><span></span>39 weeks of PRSI contributions paid or credited in the
    relevant tax year, of which 13 must be <strong>paid contributions</strong>.
    If you do not have 13 paid contributions in the relevant tax year, then 13
    paid contributions in <em>one</em> of the following tax years can be used
    instead: 
    <ul><li>Either of the two tax years before the relevant tax year</li>
      <li>The last complete tax year (before the year in which your claim for
        Illness Benefit begins)</li>
      <li>The current tax year</li>
    </ul><p><strong>or</strong></p>
    <p>26 weeks of PRSI contributions paid in the relevant tax year,
    <strong>and</strong> 26 weeks of PRSI contributions paid in the tax year
    immediately before the relevant tax year.</p>
  </li>
</ol><p>The relevant tax year is the second-last complete tax year before the year
in which your claim for Illness Benefit begins. For example: </p>

      <td style="text-align:center;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">2015</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><ul><li>Only PRSI contributions paid at class A, E, H and P count towards Illness
    Benefit.</li>
  <li>If you were getting long-term Jobseeker's Allowance, Pre-Retirement
    Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer's Allowance or Carer's Benefit
    immediately before applying for Illness Benefit, you do not need to have 13
    paid contributions.</li>
  <li>If you were getting Occupational Injury Benefit (OIB) immediately before
    applying for Illness Benefit you may use the tax year that applied to your
    OIB claim or the tax year that applies to your Illness Benefit claim,
    whichever is more beneficial.</li>
</ul><p>To help you qualify for Illness Benefit, you may combine your Irish PRSI
contributions with <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/social_insurance_contributions_from_abroad.html">social
insurance contributions from a country covered by EU Regulations</a> (and the
Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, which are covered under a bilateral
agreement).</p>

<h3>How long is Illness Benefit paid?</h3>

<p>Illness Benefit is paid for a maximum of:</p>
<ul><li>2 years (624 payment days) if you have at least 260 weeks of reckonable
    social insurance contributions* paid since you first started work 
    <p><strong>or</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>1 year (312 payment days) if you have between 104 and 259 weeks of
    reckonable social insurance contributions* paid since you first started
  work</li>
</ul><p>*Reckonable social insurance contributions paid in Ireland, EU countries,
the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man can be combined for this purpose.</p>

<p>Before your payment is due to stop, you will be contacted by the Department
of Social Protection telling you when payment will stop and giving you further
information on options available:</p>
<ul><li>If you are ill, likely to be permanently incapable of work and satisfy
    the PRSI conditions, you may qualify for <a href="invalidity_pension.html">Invalidity Pension</a></li>
  <li>If you do not qualify for Invalidity Pension and you have a disability
    that is expected to last for a year or more, you may qualify for a
    means-tested <a href="disability_allowance.html">Disability
  Allowance</a></li>
  <li>If you do not qualify for any other payments and your income is too low
    to meet your needs, you may qualify for a basic <a href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary
    Welfare Allowance</a></li>
  <li>If your Illness Benefit is ending because you are turning 66, you may be
    eligible for a <a href="../older_and_retired_people/income_supports_for_older_people.html">State
    Pension</a>. You should apply 3 months before your 66th birthday.</li>
</ul><p>If you return to work, you must have a minimum of 13 reckonable PRSI
contributions paid before you may requalify for Illness Benefit. (All other
qualifying conditions must also be satisfied.)</p>

<p>If you were on Illness Benefit for 1 year only, you may requalify with fewer
than 13 contributions, if additional contributions bring your total PRSI
contributions paid up to 260. (So, for example, if you had 250 contributions
when your Illness Benefit expired, you could work and pay 10 contributions to
requalify.)</p>

<h3>Transfer from Carer's Benefit or Carer’s Allowance</h3>

<p>If you transfer from Illness Benefit to Carer's Benefit or Carer's Allowance
and then back to Illness Benefit, your Illness Benefit will not be paid at a
lower rate than that you were paid previously.</p>

<h3>Work and Illness Benefit</h3>

<p>You cannot work while you are getting Illness Benefit (you can do voluntary
work in some cases). If you have a current Illness Benefit claim and have been
getting Illness Benefit for at least 6 months, you can apply for <a href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/partial_capacity_benefit.html">Partial
Capacity Benefit (PCB).</a> The PCB scheme allows you to return to work (if you
have a reduced capacity to work) and continue to receive a social welfare
payment. A Medical Assessor (who is a doctor employed by the Department of
Social Protection) will assess the restriction on your capacity for work, and
the personal rate of PCB paid is based on this assessment. You cannot take up
work until you have written approval to do so from the Department.</p>

<p>You cannot undertake a training or educational course or do voluntary work
without prior, written approval from the Department of Social Protection. You
must apply to the Illness Benefit section for this approval. Since 1 January
2014, new participants on SOLAS training courses can retain Illness Benefit but
they cannot get a training allowance or training bonus at the same time.</p>

<h3>Payment of Illness Benefit abroad</h3>

<p>You can continue to get Illness Benefit if you go to live in another country
<strong>covered by EU Regulations</strong>. You must tell the Department of
Social Protection in advance (otherwise you may lose payment or your payment
may be delayed).You must continue to send medical certificates from your doctor
abroad to the Department of Social Protection and you should also keep the
Department informed of any change in your circumstances. You may be called for
medical assessment while living abroad (this is arranged by the Department with
the Social Security Office of the country you are in). You must attend for a
medical assessment when asked, or your Illness Benefit will be suspended.</p>

<p>If you go to live in another country covered by EU Regulations and become
ill, you may apply for Illness Benefit from Ireland if you paid your last
insurance contribution in Ireland or you were getting Jobseeker’s Benefit in
Ireland before you went abroad.</p>

<p>Illness Benefit is not paid in countries <strong>not covered by EU
Regulations</strong>. However, if you go to a country not covered by EU
Regulations to get approved treatment your payment may resume when you
return.</p>

<p>You can read <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/EUOut-of-State.aspx">detailed FAQs from
the Department of Social Protection on claiming Illness Benefit abroad</a>.</p>

<h3>Reviews of Illness Benefit</h3>

<p>Your Illness Benefit claim will be reviewed from time to time and you may be
asked to attend for <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Publications/Pages/mrinfo1.aspx">a medical
assessment</a>. This assessment will be carried out by a Medical Assessor, who
is a doctor employed by the Department of Social Protection. The Medical
Assessor will give an opinion on whether or not you are fit for work. You must
attend for a medical assessment when asked, or your benefit will be
suspended.</p>

<p>If your Illness Benefit is stopped, you have a right to appeal the decision
- see ‘Where to apply’ below. If you are receiving credited contributions
only and these are stopped, you can seek a review of the decision but you do
not have a right to appeal it.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l1f333">Rates </h2>

<p>Usually no payment is made for the first 6 days of illness and no payment is
made for any Sunday during your illness. Note that this was extended from 3 to
6 days from 6 January 2014. </p>

<p>Illness Benefit rates are graduated according to your <em>average weekly
earnings</em> in the relevant tax year. Average weekly earnings are calculated
by dividing the total reckonable gross earnings (without deductions) in the
relevant tax year by the actual number of weeks worked in that year.</p>

<h3>Spouses, partners and children</h3>

<p>You can get an increase in your payment for an <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">adult

<h3>Taxation of Illness Benefit</h3>

<p>Illness Benefit, both the personal rate and Increase for a Qualified Adult,
(excluding increases for child dependants) is considered to be income for tax
purposes and it is taxable from the first day of payment. </p>

<p>Illness Benefit is paid directly to you without any deduction of income tax.
If you are employed, your employer will take your Illness Benefit into account
for <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/starting_work_and_changing_job/starting_work/tax_and_starting_work.html">PAYE</a>
purposes. If you are unemployed, Revenue will take account of the amount of
Illness Benefit paid to you when they adjust your tax credits or review the tax
affairs of your spouse or civil partner. Contact <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/contact/index.html">Revenue</a> for more
information.</p>

</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You should apply for Illness Benefit within 7 days of becoming ill. A delay
of more than 7 days may cause you to lose some of your payment. If there is a
good reason for a delay in applying, your payment may be backdated. </p>

<p>You can get a first social welfare medical certificate (known as MC1), which
includes an application form for Illness Benefit, from your family doctor (GP)
or hospital doctor. The reason you can only get this form from a doctor is
because a doctor must complete the medical certificate part of the form.</p>

<p>You must see your doctor and send in an intermediate medical certificate
(known as MC2) each week for as long as you are ill, unless you are told
otherwise.</p>

<p>You must get a final medical certificate from your doctor before you go back
to work.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Note that in all cases </strong>social welfare medical certificates
(MC1 and MC2) are not available online or from the Department's offices. They
are only available from doctors who are on the Department's panel of medical
certifiers.</p>

<p>You are not required to pay for a social welfare medical certificate as the
Department pays the doctor an agreed fee. However, you may have to pay for the
medical examination.</p>

<p>If you wish to make a backdated claim for Illness Benefit, you need to
supply a First Medical Certificate (MC1) stating the date the illness began, a
letter from your doctor giving details of your illness and treatment and a
current MC2 certificate.</p>

<p>If you have any difficulties completing the forms, staff in your local
social welfare office will be happy to help you. Any <span>questions</span> you
have about Illness Benefit should be made <span>directly to your </span><a shape="rect" href="http://findaddress.citizensinformation.ie/service_finder/">social welfare
local office</a> or you can call the Illness Benefit enquiries telephone line -
see 'Where to apply' below.</p>
</div>

<h3>Appeals</h3>

<p>If you think you have been wrongly refused Illness Benefit, you can ask for
the decision to be reviewed. You can also <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system_appeals.html">appeal the decision to
the Social Welfare Appeals Office</a>, either straight away or after the
review. You must request a review or appeal a decision within 21 days of being
informed of the decision. </p>

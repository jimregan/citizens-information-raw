<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) is a monthly payment for a child aged under
16 with a severe disability, who requires ongoing care and attention,
substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child
of the same age. It is not means tested.</p>

<p>You can find the definitions for terms such as <em>severe</em> or
<em>substantially</em> in the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/DCA%20Medical%20Guidelines.pdf">DCA
Medical Guidelines (pdf)</a>. These are used by the Department of Social
Protection when it is assessing applications for DCA. The guidelines state that
the payment is not based on the type of disability but on the resulting
physical or mental impairment which means that the child requires substantially
more care and attention than another child of the same age. </p>

<p>The DCA scheme was administered by the Health Service Executive (HSE) before
it was transferred to the Department of Social Protection in 2009. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/sw127.pdf">You can also read the
information leaflet for DCA (SW127)</a>. The leaflet is available from your
Intreo Centre or Citizens Information Service.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>DCA medical card scheme</h3>

<p>Since 1 June 2017, all children getting DCA are eligible for a <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical_cards_and_gp_visit_cards/medical_card.html">medical
card</a> without a means test.</p>

<p>If the child does not already have a medical card or <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical_cards_and_gp_visit_cards/gp_visit_cards.html">GP
visit card</a>, you can <a href="https://www.sspcrs.ie/portal/free-gp-care-dca-web/pub/home">register them
online</a> or <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/mc/dca/Final%20Version%20DCA%20Form.pdf">download
a registration form</a>. If the child already has a medical card or GP visit
card, they will be automatically registered for a medical card and registration
is not required.</p>

<p>The HSE has a list of <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/mc/dca/">Frequently Asked
Questions about this scheme</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To qualify, the child must have a severe disability that is likely to last
for at least 1 year and:</p>
<ul><li>Be aged under 16 (at 16, the child can apply for a <a shape="rect" href="disability_allowance.html">Disability Allowance</a> - see 'How to
    apply' below for more information) </li>
  <li>Live at home with the person claiming the allowance for 5 or more days a
    week - see 'Half-rate payment' below </li>
  <li>Meet the medical criteria - see below </li>
  <li>Be ordinarily resident in the State</li>
</ul><p>In addition, the person claiming the allowance for the child must:</p>
<ul><li>Provide for the care of the child </li>
  <li>Be <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitually
    resident</a> in the State. </li>
</ul><h3>Medical criteria</h3>

<p>The legislation states that to qualify for Domiciliary Care Allowance a
child must have "a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and
attention substantially in excess of the care and attention normally required
by a child of the same age".</p>

<p>This means that eligibility for Domiciliary Care Allowance is not based on
the type of impairment or disease, but on the resulting lack of function of
body or mind which means the child needs extra care and attention. This care
and attention must be required to allow the child to deal with the activities
of daily living. The child must be likely to require this level of care and
attention for at least 12 months.</p>

<p>The Department's Medical Assessor looks at all the following before giving
an opinion on whether your child meets the medical criteria: </p>
<ul><li>The history of the case </li>
  <li>All medical reports received (your GP fills out a medical report and you
    should include reports from any relevant specialists)</li>
  <li>Your description of the care and attention required by your child. (The
    form allows you to state what extra care your child needs under a number of
    headings.) </li>
</ul><h3>Half-rate payment</h3>

<p>Children who are being cared for on a full-time basis in residential homes
or other institutions <span>are not eligible</span> for the allowance. However,
children in residential care who go home may receive a half-rate payment if
they are at home for 2 days or more a week, for example, a child who attends
residential services from Monday to Friday and goes home at weekends. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The Domiciliary Care Allowance rate is €309.50 per month. </p>

<p>There is no restriction on the number of children for whom you may claim
Domiciliary Care Allowance. (In other words, if you are caring for more than 1
child who qualifies for Domiciliary Care Allowance, you may claim the monthly
allowance for each). </p>

<p>Payment is made on the third Tuesday of every month for the current
month.</p>

<h3>Hospital stays</h3>

<p>Payment may continue for up to 13 weeks if the child is getting medical or
other treatment in hospital.</p>

<h3>Other payments</h3>

<p>Your entitlement to <a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child
Benefit</a> is not affected and you may qualify for <a shape="rect" href="../carers/carers_benefit.html">Carer's Benefit</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../carers/carers_allowance.html">Carer's Allowance</a> if you meet the
other conditions. People getting DCA do not need to fill out the medical form
when applying for Carer's Allowance. </p>

<p>You can also claim a <a shape="rect" href="../carers/respite_care_grant.html">Carer's Support Grant</a>, which is
paid automatically each year during the month of June.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>To apply, fill in a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/domcare1.pdf">Domiciliary Care Allowance
form (pdf)</a>. You can also get an application form by texting “FORM DCA”
followed by your name and address to 51909 (standard text rates apply) or by
dropping into your <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Intreo-Centres-and-Local-and-Branch-Offices.aspx">Intreo
centre or social welfare local office</a> or local Citizens Information
Service. </p>

<p>You should complete Parts 1 to 5 of the form. Please ask your child’s
GP/specialist to fill in parts 6 and 7 (the medical section) of the form. You
should also attach any reports or other information you have about your
child’s disability and the impact it has on their care needs.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If your child has a <em>Pervasive Developmental
Disorder (PDD)</em> you are advised to have the medical professional/specialist
dealing with your child complete an additional medical form called <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/DomCare3.pdf">DomCare3 (pdf)</a>. (Please
note that completion of this form is optional since medical professionals may
have already provided a comprehensive report on your child’s medical
condition and care needs. However, if you do not have a recent report from your
child’s treating medical professional, the DomCare3 form can provide useful
additional information.)</p>

<p>The completed form will detail your child’s conditions, any specific care
needs your child might have as a result of their disability and will help the
Department’s medical assessor to form an opinion on eligibility. Pervasive
Developmental Disorder (PDD) refers to a group of disorders characterised by
delays in the development of socialisation and communication skills. Autism,
Asperger’s Syndrome, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder and Rett’s Syndrome
are generally referred to under this category.</p>

<p><strong>What happens when my child reaches the age of 16?</strong></p>

<p>DCA stops when a child reaches 16 so your last DCA payment will be for the
month of their 16th birthday. The Department of Social Protection will write to
you 3 months before your child’s 16th birthday to remind you that DCA will
shortly stop and tell you about the available options.</p>

<p>At age 16, your child can apply in their own right for <a href="disability_allowance.html">Disability Allowance (DA)</a>. DA is a
means-tested payment for people with disabilities who as a result of their
disability are substantially restricted in undertaking work that would
otherwise be suitable for a person of their age, experience and qualifications.
The qualifying conditions for DA are different from the qualifying conditions
for DCA, so your child is not automatically entitled to DA because DCA was in
payment. The means test for Disability Allowance assesses the means of your
child and your income is not taken into account.</p>

<p>Your child should apply a few months before they turn 16, to allow time for
their application to be processed. Your entitlement to a Carer's Allowance will
only be stopped where on review it is decided that your child no longer
requires full-time care and attention. A Carer’s Allowance may be reviewed at
any time to ensure that you continue to meet the conditions. </p>

<h3>Reviews and appeals</h3>

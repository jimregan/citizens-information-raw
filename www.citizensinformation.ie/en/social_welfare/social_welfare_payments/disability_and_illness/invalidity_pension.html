<p>Invalidity Pension is a weekly payment to people who cannot work because of
a long-term illness or disability and are covered by <a href="../../../money_and_tax/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social
insurance (PRSI)</a>. At 66, you transfer automatically to <a shape="rect" href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html">the
State Pension (Contributory)</a> at the full rate. Invalidity Pension is <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">taxable</a>.
You are entitled to a <a shape="rect" href="../extra_social_welfare_benefits/free_travel.html">Free Travel Pass</a>.
You may also get <a shape="rect" href="../extra_social_welfare_benefits/">extra

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Social insurance contributions</h3>

<p>To get Invalidity Pension you must have at least:</p>
<ul><li>260 (5 years) paid PRSI contributions since entering social insurance</li>
  <li>48 contributions paid or credited in the last complete tax year before
    the date of your claim </li>
</ul><p>Note that only PRSI paid in classes A, E and H count. The last complete tax
year is the year before your claim. For example, if you claim Invalidity
Pension in 2017, the last complete tax year is 2016.</p>

<h3>Medical criteria</h3>

<p>Invalidity Pension is a payment for insured people who are permanently
incapable of work because of an illness or incapacity.</p>

<p>To qualify you must:</p>
<ul><li>Have been incapable of work for at least 12 months and be likely to be
    incapable of work for at least another 12 months (you will probably have
    been getting Illness Benefit or Disability Allowance during that time) </li>
</ul><p><strong>Or</strong></p>
<ul><li>Be permanently incapable of work (in certain cases of very serious
    illness or disability, you can transfer directly from another social
    welfare payment or from your job to Invalidity Pension). </li>
</ul><p>A deciding officer of the Department of Social Protection will examine your
claim and determine your entitlement based on the qualifying conditions
outlined above. </p>

<h3>Invalidity Pension and work</h3>

<p>Since 13 February 2012, <a href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/partial_capacity_benefit.html">Partial
Capacity Benefit</a> has replaced the previous exemption arrangements where
people on Invalidity Pension could get permission to work part-time (known as
an exemption) for rehabilitative or therapeutic purposes and keep their full
social welfare payment. There is no requirement that the work a person does
while on Partial Capacity Benefit has to be for rehabilitative or therapeutic
purposes.</p>

<h4>Training and employment schemes</h4>

<p>If you are on Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension and want to do a <a href="../../../education/vocational_education_and_training/fas_training_programmes_and_supports/fas_training_courses.html">training
course</a>, you do not go onto Partial Capacity Benefit. You apply to the
Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension section, as appropriate. </p>

<p>If you want to do a Community Employment scheme you apply in the normal
way.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>To apply fill in an <a shape="rect" href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/inv1.pdf">Invalidity Pension application
form (INV1) (pdf)</a>. You can also get a form from your <a shape="rect" href="http://findaddress.citizensinformation.ie/service_finder/">Intreo Centre
or Social Welfare Branch Office</a>. You may qualify for <a href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary
Welfare Allowance</a> while you are waiting for your claim to be processed. </p>

<p>If you have been getting Illness Benefit for a period of 468 days you will
be medically assessed for continued entitlement to Illness Benefit and possible
entitlement to Invalidity Pension. If as a result of this assessment it is
considered that you may be entitled to Invalidity Pension, an application form
(INV2) will be sent to you. When they get the completed form a Deciding Officer
will examine the claim and determine eligibility for Invalidity Pension.</p>

<p>This does not stop you from applying for Invalidity Pension in the normal
way using application form (INV1).</p>

<p>You can get help to fill in your form from your <a shape="rect" href="http://findaddress.citizensinformation.ie/service_finder/">local Citizens
Information Centre</a>, Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office.</p>

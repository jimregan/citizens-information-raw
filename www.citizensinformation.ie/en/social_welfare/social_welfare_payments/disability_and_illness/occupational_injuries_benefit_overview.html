<p>The Occupational Injuries Scheme provides benefits for people injured or
incapacitated by an accident at work or while travelling directly to or from
work. The scheme also covers people who have contracted a disease as a result
of the type of work they do. There are a number of benefits available and there
are different conditions attached to each benefit. </p>

<p><span>The benefits are:</span> </p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="injury_benefit.html">Injury Benefit </a></li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="disablement_benefit.html">Disablement Benefit</a>
  </li>
  <li>Incapacity Supplement </li>
  <li>Constant Attendance Allowance </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="medical_care_scheme.html">Medical Care Scheme</a>.
  </li>
</ul><p>There are also <a href="../death_related_benefits/dependent_parents_pension.html">death
benefits</a> under this scheme:</p>
<ul><li>Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Pension (paid at a higher
    rate than the ordinary Contributory Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil
    Partner's Pension) </li>
  <li>Orphan's Pension</li>
  <li>Funeral Grant</li>
</ul><p><strong><span>Injury Benefit</span></strong> is a weekly payment if you are
unfit for work due to the accident or disease. Payment is normally made from
the 7th day of incapacity for work. Injury Benefit can be paid for up to 26
weeks from the date of your accident or development of the disease (not the
date you apply). If the accident or disease caused you to lose physical or
mental ability you should apply for Disablement Benefit before your Injury
Benefit ceases. If you are still unfit for work after 26 weeks you may apply
for <a shape="rect" href="disability_benefit.html">Illness Benefit</a> or <a shape="rect" href="disability_allowance.html">Disability Allowance</a>.</p>

<p><span><strong>Disablement Benefit</strong></span> is paid if you have a loss
of physical or mental faculty after the accident or disease. You do not have to
be unfit for work. If you are fit for work immediately after the accident you
should apply within 3 months of the injury or onset of the disease. You must
have a medical assessment to determine the degree of loss of faculty and the
rate of benefit is based on this. (Civil servants insured at Class B are not
eligible for Disablement Benefit for the first 26 weeks after the date of the
accident. Half-rate benefit only is payable after this period.) Disablement
Benefit can be paid as a lump sum (called Disablement Gratuity) or as a weekly
payment (called Disablement Pension). </p>

<p><span><strong>Incapacity Supplement</strong> </span>is a weekly supplement,
which may be paid if you are not eligible for Illness Benefit or another social
welfare payment. To get the supplement you must be getting Disablement Pension
<em>and</em> be permanently incapable of work. </p>

<p><span><strong>Constant Attendance Allowance</strong></span> is a weekly
allowance, which you may be paid if you are getting Disablement Benefit and are
so seriously disabled as to need someone to help you daily at home to attend to
your personal needs.</p>

<p>If you incur medical costs as a result of your occupational injury or
disease, you can claim for the cost of certain expenses which are not already
covered by the <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/how_health_is_organised/health_boards.html">Health Service
Executive (HSE)</a> or through the <a shape="rect" href="treatment_benefit_scheme.html">Treatment Benefit Scheme</a> under the
Medical Care Scheme. </p>

<p>The cost of private or semi-private accommodation and treatment
<strong>can</strong> <strong>not</strong> be recouped under the Occupational
Injuries Scheme.<br></p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>In general people in employment insurable at PRSI Class A, D, J or M are
covered in full for Occupational Injuries Benefits. </p>

<p>Civil servants recruited prior to April 1995 and insured at Class B may only
qualify for limited Occupational Injuries Benefits.</p>

<p>Education and Training Board trainees, people on employment schemes and
people over 66 who are working are covered for Occupational Injuries
Benefits.</p>

<p>Unlike other social insurance benefits, it is not necessary to have a set
number of PRSI contributions to qualify. It is simply necessary to be in
employment that is insurable for Occupational Injuries. </p>

<h3>Civil law claims for damages</h3>

<p>The Recovery of Certain Benefits and Assistance (RBA) Scheme enables the
Department of Social Protection to recover the <strong>value</strong> of
certain illness-related social welfare payments as a consequence of personal
injuries claims. They are recovered from the compensator and not from the
injured person. <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Recovery-of-Benefits-and-Assistance.aspx">Read

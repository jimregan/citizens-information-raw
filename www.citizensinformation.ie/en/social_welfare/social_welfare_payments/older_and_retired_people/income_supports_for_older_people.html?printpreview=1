<p>A range of payments are made to older people by the Department of Social
Protection and the Health Service Executive. If you are unsure whether or not
you would qualify for a payment, you should apply anyway.</p>

<p>Generally payments are made up of a personal payment for yourself and extra
amounts for your dependent spouse, civil partner or cohabitant and any
dependent children. A cohabitant is a person living in an intimate and
committed relationship with a person of the same or opposite sex who is not
that person’s spouse, civil partner, or a close relative.</p>

<p>You should apply to the Department of Social Protection for your pension at
least <strong>four months in advance</strong>.</p>

<h3>Changes to the qualifying age for State pensions</h3>

<p>The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 made a number of changes to the
qualifying age for State pensions. The qualifying age will rise to 66 in 2014 ,
67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028. So:</p>
<ul><li>If you were born on or after 1 January 1948 the minimum qualifying State
    pension age will be 66 (because the State Pension (Transition) will no
    longer be paid).</li>
  <li>If you were born on or after 1 January 1955 the minimum qualifying State
    pension age will be 67.</li>
  <li>If you were born on or after 1 January 1961 the minimum qualifying State
    pension age will be 68.</li>
</ul><h2>Social insurance payments</h2>

<p>You need enough <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_classes.html">PRSI
contributions</a> to qualify for these payments. Apply to the Department of
Social Protection.</p>

<h4><strong>State Pension (Transition)</strong></h4>

<p><strong>From 1 January 2014 the State Pension (Transition) is no longer paid
to new applicants.</strong> This means that there is a standard State Pension
age of 66 years for everyone. </p>

<h4><strong>State Pension (Contributory)</strong></h4>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/state_pension_contributory.html">State
Pension (Contributory)</a> is payable from the age of 66. You are allowed to
have income from any other source while you receive this pension, but both the
income and the pension are taxable.</p>

<p>There are a number of pro-rata State Pensions (Contributory) which are paid
at a lower rate. These were introduced to deal with issues that arose as a
result of people paying different types of social insurance contributions or
not paying contributions for various reasons. </p>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/234_National-Pensions-Framework.aspx">National
Pensions Framework</a> a number of other changes are planned to the qualifying
conditions for the State Pension (Contributory) from 2020. These changes do not
affect the State Pension (Non-Contributory). <br></p>

<h4><strong>Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory
Pension</strong></h4>

<p>You may be eligible for <a shape="rect" href="../death_related_benefits/widows_contrib_pension.html">Widow’s,
Widower’s or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension</a> if you are
widowed or a surviving civil partner, have not remarried or entered into a new
civil partnership, and are not cohabiting. You can transfer to the State
Pension (Contributory) at the age of 66.</p>

<h3>Means-tested payments</h3>

<p>Any means you may have, such as weekly income or savings, are taken into
account for these payments, but not your own home. You must also satisfy the <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitual
residence</a> condition. Apply to the Department of Social Protection.</p>

<h4><strong>State Pension (Non-Contributory)</strong></h4>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="state_pension_non_contributory.html">State Pension
(Non-Contributory)</a> is a payment for people aged 66 or over who do not
qualify for a State Pension (Contributory).</p>

<h4><strong>Widow’s, Widower’s or Surviving Civil Partner's
Non-Contributory Pension</strong></h4>

<p>If you are a widowed person or a surviving civil partner who is not entitled
to a Widow’s, Widower’s or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension,
has not remarried or entered into a new civil partnership, has no dependent
children and is not cohabiting, you may be eligible for a <a shape="rect" href="../death_related_benefits/widows_non_contrib_pen.html">Widow's, Widower's
or Surviving Civil Partner's Non-Contributory Pension</a>. This is a
means-tested payment. At age 66 you transfer to the State Pension
(Non-Contributory).</p>

<h3>Private pensions</h3>

<h4><strong>Occupational and personal pensions</strong></h4>

<p><a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/occupational_pensions.html">Occupational
pensions</a> are organised by employers to provide pensions to employees on
retirement or to surviving dependants on the death of an employee. Personal
pensions or <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/personal_retirement_savings_accounts.html">Personal
Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs)</a> are organised individually by
self-employed people or employed people who do not have an occupational pension
scheme.</p>

<p>You need to deal directly with the pension provider to find out exactly what
benefits your pension gives you. The Pensions Authority is the regulatory body
for occupational pensions and PRSAs. If you have a complaint, the Authority
will advise you about your rights. The Pensions Ombudsman investigates and
decides on complaints relating to occupational pensions and PRSAs. Generally,
you may have income from other sources, for example, from work, if you are
receiving a pension. There are some restrictions on people getting both a
pension and employment income from the public sector – you should check with
the pension provider.</p>

<h3>Other social welfare payments</h3>

<p>Apply to the Department of Social Protection for these payments.</p>

<h4><strong>Increase for Living Alone </strong></h4>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../extra_social_welfare_benefits/living_alone_allowance.html">Increase
for Living Alone</a> is a supplementary payment for people in Ireland on Irish
social welfare pensions who are living alone. It is also available to people
under the age of 66 who get certain other payments from the Department of
Social Protection.</p>

<h4>Aged 80 increase</h4>

<p>If you are getting an Irish social welfare pension, you automatically get an
increase in your pension when you reach 80 years of age. </p>

<h4><strong>Increase for Living on a Specified Island </strong></h4>

<p>This is an increase in the weekly payment of certain payments from the DSP,
or the EU equivalent, to people who are aged 66 or over and living on a
specified island off the coast of Ireland. The <a shape="rect" href="../extra_social_welfare_benefits/island_allowance.html">Increase for
Living on a Specified Island</a><strong></strong>is to compensate for the
additional costs of living on these islands compared to living on the mainland.
</p>

<h4><strong>Household Benefits Package</strong></h4>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../extra_social_welfare_benefits/household_benefits_package.html">Household
Benefits Package</a> includes the Electricity or Natural Gas Allowance and a
Free TV Licence (the Telephone Allowance was discontinued in 2014). If you are
aged 70 or over, you qualify regardless of your income or who lives with you.
The scheme may also be available to people aged 66 and over who get certain
social welfare payments or whose income is below certain limits. Apply to the
Department of Social Protection.</p>

<h4><strong>Free travel</strong></h4>

<p>If you are over the age of 66 or getting a carers' or certain other social
welfare payments, you can get a Free Travel Pass, entitling you to free travel
at any time on bus, road, rail and DART services operated by Bus Átha Cliath,
Bus Éireann, Iarnród Éireann, LUAS services, the Aran Islands ferry service
and on certain private services which have opted into the scheme. </p>

<p>You can also use your Free Travel Pass on any of the 34 schemes under the
Rural Transport Initiative. People who are entitled to free travel are also
entitled to have their spouse/partner travel free with them or may be entitled
to a Companion Pass on medical grounds. The <a shape="rect" href="../extra_social_welfare_benefits/free_travel.html">Free Travel Scheme</a>
also covers public transport services in Northern Ireland for people over 66
years of age. To use this service you must have a Senior SmartPass Card.</p>

<h4><strong>National Fuel Scheme</strong></h4>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../extra_social_welfare_benefits/fuel_allowance.html">National Fuel
Scheme</a> is a means-tested payment to help people who cannot afford their own
heating costs. You may qualify if you get certain payments from the Department
of Social Protection or the EU equivalent.</p>

<h4><strong>Carers</strong></h4>

<p>If you are providing full-time care to someone who is ill or incapacitated,
you may qualify for a carer’s payment. More information is available in our
document on <a shape="rect" href="../carers/payments_to_carers.html">payments
to carers</a>.</p>

<h4><strong>Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme</strong></h4>

<p>Under this scheme, services like attic insulation and draught-proofing are
provided to low-income households nationwide. There is no charge. Read more
about the <a href="../../../housing/housing_grants_and_schemes/warmer_homes_scheme.html">Better
Energy Warmer Homes Scheme</a></p>

<h4><strong>Refuse and water charges</strong></h4>

<p>In some local authority areas, low-income households can avail of a waiver
(that is, a reduction or total exemption) on waste and water charges made by
private operators and by local authorities. These waivers vary greatly from
region to region and in some areas they are not available at all. To find out
if your local authority operates a waiver scheme, you should contact them
directly.</p>

<h4><strong>Working in retirement</strong> </h4>

<p>If you are getting a means-tested payment, working or being self-employed
affects the amount of that payment. You should check with the Department of
Social Protection before taking up work to see what the effect will be. You can
have up to €200 earnings from insurable employment without affecting your
State Pension (Non-Contributory).</p>

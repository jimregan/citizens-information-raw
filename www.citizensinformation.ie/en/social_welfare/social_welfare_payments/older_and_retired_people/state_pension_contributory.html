<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The State Pension (Contributory) is paid to people from the age of 66 who
have enough Irish <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social
insurance contributions</a>. It is not means-tested. You can have other income
and still get a State Pension (Contributory). This <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">pension
is taxable</a> but you are unlikely to pay tax if it is your only income. </p>

<p>As the social insurance conditions are very complex you should apply for a
State Pension (Contributory) if you have ever worked and have any contributions
(stamps) paid at any time. There are a number of <em>pro-rata pensions</em>
available to people who paid different types of social insurance contributions
or who did not pay contributions because of various reasons (see below).
Changes are proposed to the current system in 2020 (see 'Further information'
below).</p>

<p>If you <a href="early_retirement.html">retire early</a>, you should
ensure that you <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/voluntarysocialinsurancecontributions.html">continue
to pay PRSI contributions</a> or get <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">credited
contributions</a> (if eligible) to maintain your entitlement to a pension. If
you are getting <a href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker's Benefit</a>
(JB) and are aged between 65 and 66 when your JB would normally end, you may
continue to receive it until the age of 66, provided you meet the PRSI
requirements. </p>

<p>The Department of Social Protection has published <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Qualifying-for-State-Pension-Contributory.aspx">FAQs
on Qualifying for the State Pension (Contributory)</a> which can help you to
work out whether you qualify for a State Pension (Contributory). </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To qualify for a State Pension (Contributory) you must be aged 66 or over
and have enough Class A, E, F,G, H, N or S social insurance contributions.</p>

<p>You need to: </p>
<ol><li>Have paid social insurance contributions before a certain age </li>
  <li>Have a certain number of social insurance contributions paid and </li>
  <li>Have a certain average number over the years since you first started to
    pay </li>
</ol><h3>1. Paid insurance before a certain age</h3>

<p>You must have started to pay social insurance before the age of 56. (The age
limit is higher for people born before 1922.)</p>

<h4>Entry into insurance</h4>

<p>Your <em>entry into insurance</em> means the date on which you first started
to pay social insurance. </p>

<p>The rules that determine when you entered into insurance are quite complex
for those with mixed insurance, that is, full social insurance for some of the
time and modified at other times. </p>

<p>Normally the date of starting insurable employment is taken as the date of
the first paid employment contribution.</p>

<p>However if you have a mixture of full- and modified-rate contributions and
paid your first full-rate employment contribution before 6 April 1991 and
before you reached 56 years of age, your entry into insurance can be the date
on which you first started to pay the full rate of insurance if that would be
to your advantage. </p>

<p>If you started to pay full insurance after 6 April 1991, your entry into
insurance is the time you first paid any social insurance. </p>

<p>There are also special entry into insurance rules for self-employed people.
If you started to pay self-employed contributions on 6 April 1988 and had
previously paid employee insurance at any time, then the date of entry into
insurance can be either 6 April 1988 or the date on which you actually first
paid insurance, whichever is to your advantage.</p>

<h3>2. Number of paid contributions</h3>

<p><span>If you reach pension age <strong>on or after April 6
2012</strong></span>, you need to have 520 full-rate contributions (10 years
contributions). In this case, only 260 of the 520 contributions may be
voluntary contributions.</p>

<p>However, if you were a voluntary contributor on or before April 6 1997 and
you have a yearly average of 20 contributions, you may meet the requirement if
you have a total of 520 full-rate contributions (of which only 156 need to be
compulsory paid contributions).</p>

<p><span>If you reached pension age on or after 6 April 2002</span>, you needed
to have 260 full-rate contributions (effectively 5 years contributions but they
do not need to be consecutive). </p>

<p><span>If you reached pension age before 6 April 2002</span>, you needed 156
qualifying full-rate contributions (a total of 3 years but they did not have to
be consecutive).</p>

<p>Note that social insurance contributions fall into the four groups below.</p>
<ul><li><a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_classes.html">Full-rate
    social insurance contributions</a> are PRSI contributions at Classes A, E,
    F, G, H, N and S or at the 'ordinary' rate before 6 April 1979. </li>
  <li>Modified-rate social insurance contributions are PRSI contributions at
    Classes B, C and D (paid by civil and public servants). </li>
  <li><a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/voluntarysocialinsurancecontributions.html">Voluntary
    contributions</a> are made by people under age 66 who are no longer covered
    by compulsory PRSI provided they satisfy certain conditions. </li>
  <li><a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">Credited
    contributions ('credits')</a> are similar to the social insurance
    contributions you pay while employed and are usually awarded at the same
    rate as your last paid social insurance contribution. You may get credits
    when you are claiming a social welfare payment. Credits are not allowed
    after self-employed contributions (Class S).</li>
</ul><h3>3. Average number of contributions per year</h3>

<p>You must meet the average condition. This is probably the most complex
aspect of qualifying for a State Pension (Contributory).</p>

<h4>Normal average rule</h4>

<p>The normal average rule states that you must have a yearly average of at
least 10 appropriate contributions paid or credited from the year you first
entered insurance or from 1953, whichever is later to the end of the tax year
before you reach pension age (66). An average of 10 entitles you to a minimum
pension; you need an average of 48 to get the maximum pension.</p>

<h4>Alternative average rule</h4>

<p>This alternative average only applies to people who reach pension age on or
after 6 April 1992. </p>

<p>It requires that you have an average of 48 Class A, E, F, G, H, N or S
contributions (paid or credited) for each contribution year from the 1979/80
tax year to the end of the tax year before you reach pension age (66). This
average would entitle you to the maximum pension. There is no provision for a
reduced pension when this alternative average is used.</p>

<p>So, if you reach the age of 66 on or after April 6 1992, your average will
be looked at in two ways - the usual average will be assessed and the
alternative average will be assessed. Most employed or formerly employed people
will be able to meet the alternative average. The alternative average will
probably be looked at first because it is easier to assess. If you do not have
an average of 48 contributions from 1979 then the normal method of assessing
the average will be looked at and you may get a reduced pension (if you do not
meet the alternative average, it is virtually impossible for you to have an
average of 48 using the normal average rule). </p>

<h3>Working in the home and State pensions</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/homemakers_scheme.html">Homemakers'
Scheme</a> makes it easier for people who stop working for a period to take
care of children or adults to qualify for pensions. The scheme was introduced
from 6 April 1994 and applies to anyone who provides full-time care for a child
under age 12 or an ill or disabled person age 12 or over. It does not apply to
time spent caring before the introduction of the scheme. It is most beneficial
for people who work outside the home for a number of years and then spend a
number of years as carers. It applies equally to women and men.</p>

<p>From 6 April 1994, a contribution year spent as a homemaker may be
disregarded in the calculation of the yearly average (see above) up to a
maximum of 20 years. This has the effect of increasing your yearly average as
the same number of total contributions are divided by a smaller number of
years. So, the fact that you do not have any contributions in those years will
not reduce your yearly average and will make it easier for you to qualify for a
State Pension (Contributory).</p>

<h2>Pro-rata pensions</h2>

<p>There are a number of pro-rata pensions, which were introduced because of
the exclusion of some people from the social insurance system at particular
times.</p>

<h3>Pro-rata pension for mixed insurance</h3>

<p>Pro-rata pensions were introduced for people with mixed insurance records.
Mixed insurance arises when a person spends part of his/her working life in the
public service paying modified social insurance contributions and part in the
private sector paying full rate social insurance contributions. </p>

<p>Many people have had a career in both the public and private sector but do
not have mixed insurance. This is because no insurance was payable by people
whose incomes were above certain limits before 1 April 1974. Certain groups who
are now insured were outside the scope of the system - Gardai are insurable
since 1 April 1974; certain members of religious orders since 6 April 1988 and
doctors and dentists in the civil service since 6 April 1988.</p>

<p>People with mixed insurance may have enough full rate contributions to
enable them to qualify for a State Pension (Contributory). This depends on the
exact circumstances of each case. It could happen that one person would qualify
while another, who might have more contributions, would not qualify.</p>

<p>Since 1991, a State Pension (Contributory) may be payable on a pro-rata
basis to people with mixed insurance. If you reach pension age on or after 6
April 2012, you need to have a total of at least 520 full-rate and modified
rate contributions paid.</p>

<p>You must also have:</p>
<ul><li>At least 260 paid contributions at the full rate since entry into
    insurance or 1953, whichever is later </li>
  <li>A mixture of full and modified contributions, which when added together
    give you a yearly average of 10 (for the State Pension Contributory) from
    the time you first entered insurance or 1953, whichever is later, to the
    end of the contribution year before your 66th birthday. </li>
  <li>Failed to qualify for a pension under EU regulations or under reciprocal
    arrangements with other countries or only qualified for a pension at a
    lower rate than this pro-rata pension would give you. </li>
</ul><p>If you meet all these requirements, you may qualify for a pension
proportionate to the number of contributions that you have at the full rate. To
take a very simple example, if you worked for 40 years up to age 66 and 10 of
those were in the private sector, you would get one-quarter of the normal
pension. </p>

<p>The amount paid is in proportion to your full-rate contributions as a
percentage of your overall contributions. To calculate your pension you add
contributions at the full and modified rates together. The average is then
measured in the normal way. If you have an average of at least 10 then you may
qualify. Then the number of full rate contributions is divided by the total
number of contributions to find out what proportion are full rate; you then get
that proportion of the pension. The Increase for a Qualified Adult payable with
this pension is proportioned as well.</p>

<h3>Pro-rata pension for intermittent insurance </h3>

<p>This pension applied to people with intermittent insurance and who had a
yearly average of under 10. It no longer applies to new applicants (from
January 2013). This pro-rata pension was only payable to people who meet
specific conditions. That is, they had to have a broken insurance record and
have re-entered insurance in 1974 because of the removal of the income limit.
Their average is measured in the usual way and if that average is 10 or more
they got a pension in the normal way. However, if it was between 5 and 9 they
got a special partial pension which was one quarter of the maximum pension. </p>

<p>See <strong>Further information</strong> below for more information on other
pro-rata pensions that no longer apply to many people (because most people who
would qualify are now over 66).</p>

<h2>Pro-rata EU pensions</h2>

<p>If you have worked in Ireland and one or more EU states your social
insurance contributions from each EU state will be added to your Irish social
insurance contributions to help you qualify for a social welfare payment. More
information about <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/social_insurance_contributions_from_abroad.html">combining
your social insurance contributions to qualify for a state pension</a> is
available.</p>

<p>Increases for a qualified adult and pensioners over 80 years of age are
calculated in the same way as the personal rate of pension. Increases for a
qualified child are payable from one country only and, if from Ireland, are
paid in full.</p>

<h3>Bilateral social security agreements</h3>

<p>Ireland has <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/social_insurance_contributions_from_abroad.html">bilateral
social security agreements</a> with Canada, the USA, Australia, New Zealand,
Austria, Japan, Republic of Korea and Quebec (which has a separate system from
the rest of Canada). These agreements are broadly similar and they generally
provide that social insurance paid in Ireland and the other country can be
combined to help people qualify for old age and retirement pensions. Again, in
general, the method of calculation is similar to the EU rules. </p>

<h2 class="further_info" id="l414eb">Further information </h2>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2006/act/5/enacted/en/html">Social
Welfare Law Reform and Pensions Act 2006 (pdf)</a> changed the name of the Old
Age Contributory Pension to State Pension (Contributory). The new name came
into effect on 29 September, 2006.<br></p>

<h3>Changes to the State Pension (Contributory)</h3>

<p>The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 made a number of changes to the
qualifying age for State pensions. The qualifying age will rise to 67 in 2021
and 68 in 2028. So:</p>
<ul><li>If you were born on or after 1 January 1955 the minimum qualifying State
    pension age will be 67.</li>
  <li>If you were born on or after 1 January 1961 the minimum qualifying State
    pension age will be 68.</li>
</ul><h4>Proposed changes</h4>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/234_National-Pensions-Framework.aspx">National
Pensions Framework</a> a number of other changes were proposed to the
qualifying conditions for the State Pension (Contributory). </p>

<p>This is a summary of the proposals. Note that legislation is required before
these changes come into effect and that, at present, these remain proposals.</p>

<p>The main change proposed was the introduction of a total contributions
approach to replace the current yearly averaging system. This means that the
amount of pension paid to you would be directly proportionate to the number of
social insurance contributions and/or credits you have made over your working
life.</p>

<p>So if you were born after 1 January 1954, when you reach pension age, you
would need a total of 30 years contributions and/or credits to get the maximum
State Pension. You would be able to get the minimum State Pension if you have
paid 520 full-rate contributions (10 years). The minimum pension would be one
third of the maximum rate. You could then get a further 1/30th of the pension
for each additional year of contributions that you have. The maximum number of
credits that could be used in calculating your entitlement to State Pension
would be 520 (or 10 years).</p>

<h3>Pro-rata pensions</h3>

<h3>Pro-rata pension for self-employed people</h3>

<p>The self-employed have been obliged to pay social insurance since 1988.
Prior to that, some self-employed people were voluntarily paying insurance.
Some self-employed people were already over the minimum age when they first
started to pay contributions in 1988. In April 1999, a special pro-rata pension
was introduced for them. Only people aged 56 or over on 6 April 1988 (born on
or before 6 April 1932) qualify for this pension. </p>

<h3>Pro-rata pensions for people with pre-1953 contributions</h3>

<p>There is a special pro-rata pension for people with pre-1953 contributions.
This pro-rata pension was introduced in May 2000. You may qualify if you have
at least 520 full contributions, some of which must have been paid before 1953.
Every 2 contributions paid before 1953 count as 3.</p>

<p>If you meet these conditions, you may get a pro-rata pension of half the
normal maximum rate. The increases for a qualified adult and child are also at
payable at half-rate. The increase for pensioners over 80 years of age is paid
in full.</p>

<h3>Pro-rata pension for intermittent insurance </h3>

<p>This pension no longer applies to new applicants from January 2013. </p>

<p>The first group for whom pro-rata pensions were arranged were those who had
been in and out of insurance because of the operation of the income limit on
contributions. Prior to 1974, non-manual workers were obliged to pay social
insurance contributions only if their income was below a certain level. From 1
April 1974, there has been no income limit. Many people paid social insurance
for a period and then ceased to pay when their income went above the limit then
came back into the insurance system in April 1974 because of the abolition of
the income limit . They would not meet the usual average requirement because
they ceased to pay for a while. On 14 October 1988, arrangements were made for
them to qualify for a pro-rata pension. </p>

<p>Their average is measured in the usual way and if that average is 10 or more
they get a pension in the normal way. However, if it is between 5 and 9 they
may get a special partial pension which is one quarter of the maximum pension.
This pro-rata pension is payable to people who meet the quite specific
conditions outlined. That is, you must have a broken insurance record and have
re-entered insurance in 1974 because of the removal of the income limit. If you
re-entered insurance in that year for any other reason (for example, because
you had previously been self-employed or out of the country), you do not meet
these specific terms and you would not be eligible for this pro-rata pension.
</p>

<p>If you qualify for this pro-rata pension you may also get the appropriate
Increase for Qualified Adult for a dependent spouse, civil partner or
cohabitant and an Increase for a Qualified Child. </p>

<p>This pro-rata pension is for State Pension (Contributory) and <a shape="rect" href="../death_related_benefits/widows_contrib_pension.html">Widow’s,
Widower’s or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension</a> only. Because
it is easier to qualify for a Widow’s, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's
Contributory Pension the numbers who need the pro-rata pensions are very small.

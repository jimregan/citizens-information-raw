<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory) is a payment for people
aged over 66 who do not qualify for a <a href="state_pension_contributory.html">State Pension (Contributory)</a> or
who only qualify for a reduced contributory pension based on their insurance
record. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2006/act/5/enacted/en/html">Social
Welfare Law Reform and Pensions Act 2006 (pdf)</a> changed the name of the Old
Age (Non-Contributory) Pension to State Pension (Non-Contributory). The new
name came into effect on 29 September 2006. </p>

<p>This <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">pension
is taxable</a> but you are unlikely to pay tax if it is your only income.</p>

<h3>Changes to the qualifying age for State pensions</h3>

<p>The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 made a number of changes to the
qualifying age for State pensions. The qualifying age will rise to 67 in 2021
and 68 in 2028. So:</p>
<ul><li>If you were born on or after 1 January 1955 the minimum qualifying State
    pension age will be 67</li>
  <li>If you were born on or after 1 January 1961 the minimum qualifying State
    pension age will be 68</li>
</ul><p>Under the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/234_National-Pensions-Framework.aspx">National
Pensions Framework</a> a number of other changes are planned to the qualifying
conditions for the State Pension (Contributory) from 2020. These changes do not
affect the State Pension (Non-Contributory). </p>

<p></p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You may qualify for the State Pension (Non-Contributory) if:</p>
<ul><li>You are aged 66 or over </li>
  <li>You pass a <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/means_test.html">means
    test</a> </li>
  <li>You meet the <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitual
    residence condition </a></li>
</ul><h3>The means test</h3>

<p>Your means are assessed under the following headings: </p>
<ul><li>Cash income (including income from work) </li>
  <li>Value of capital (for example, savings, investments, cash on hand and
    property but <strong>not</strong> your own home) </li>
  <li>Income from property personally used </li>
</ul><h3>Cash income</h3>

<p>Any cash income you have is assessed in the means test. This includes income
from a social security pension from another country. However, certain items of
cash income are not taken into account in the means test. For example, earnings
of up to €200 per week from employment (but not self-employment) are not
taken into account (or are <em>disregarded</em>). This disregard applies to
both you and your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant. Any income from work
above €200 is assessed as means. </p>

<p>If you own or lease land your net income from farming or leasing is fully
assessed with no disregards. The net income is worked out by deducting expenses
incurred from the gross income. If you own land that is not productively used
or leased this is assessed on its capital value.</p>

<p>Payments you get under the Farm Retirement Scheme and income from property
that has already been assessed on its capital value are also not taken into
account.</p>

<p>More information is available in our document about <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/cash_income_not_included_in_the_social_welfare_means_test.html">cash
income not taken into account in the means test.</a></p>

<h3>Capital and property not personally used</h3>

<p>Savings, investments, cash on hand and any property you own (<strong>but not
your own home</strong>) is assessed as capital. All your capital from different
sources is added together and a special formula is then used to find your
weekly means from capital. </p>

<p>The property and investments that may be assessed under this heading include
savings in a bank account (or anywhere else), a house that you have let and
stocks and shares. You may or may not be getting an income from the property or
investment. Income from property already assessed on its capital value is not
assessed in the means test - see 'Cash income' above.</p>

<p>If you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant saves a portion of your
State Pension (Non-Contributory) each week, these savings as well as savings
from most other sources will be taken into account as part of your means. </p>

<p>More information is available in our document on <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/how_to_assess_your_means_from_capital_for_social_welfare_payments.html">how
capital and property is assessed as means.</a></p>

<p>Different rules for the assessment of capital are used in the means tests
for Disability Allowance (DA) and State Pension (Non-Contributory), this means,
people moving from DA to State Pension (Non-Contributory) at age 66 could find
that their pension is lower than their DA. The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2008/en/act/pub/0002/index.html">Social
Welfare and Pension Act 2008</a> provides that, if you are moving from DA to
State Pension (Non-Contributory) at age 66 you will not get a lower-rate
pension because of a less favourable assessment of capital.</p>

<h3>Income from property personally used (your home)</h3>

<p>The value of the house you live in is <strong>not</strong> taken into
account in the means test. However, any income you are getting from it is taken
into account. For example, if you rented a room in your house, that income is
assessed. There is an exception to this, if not renting the room means that you
would be living alone then your income from rent is not taken into account.</p>

<p><strong>Selling your home</strong></p>

<p>If you sell your home, the proceeds of the sale would normally be taken into
account as means. If you are living in accommodation which no longer suits you
or which you are no longer able to maintain, you may be able to sell your home
and move to more suitable accommodation and have up to €190,500 of the
proceeds of the sale excluded from the means test. This exemption of €190,500
applies if you sell your house in order to:</p>
<ul><li>Buy or rent more suitable alternative accommodation </li>
  <li>Move into a private nursing home which is registered under the Health
    (Nursing Homes) Act 1990</li>
  <li>Move in with a person who is getting a carer's payment to care for
  you</li>
  <li>Move to sheltered or special housing in the voluntary, co-operative,
    statutory or private sectors</li>
</ul><p>Usually the first €190,500 of the sale proceeds is not taken into account.
However, if you use the proceeds of the sale to buy more suitable
accommodation, the balance of the proceeds <strong>after</strong> buying the
new accommodation is exempt up to a limit of €190,500. </p>

<p>However the proceeds of the sale may be taken into account by the Health
Service Executive (HSE) when your entitlement to the <a href="../../../health/health_services_for_older_people/nursing_homes_support_scheme_1.html">Fair
Deal Scheme for nursing home care</a> is being assessed.</p>

<p><strong>Investment income from the sale of your home</strong></p>

<p>Any benefit you get from investing the sale proceeds is assessable as means.
Interest which is kept as capital is assessable in the same way as capital is
normally assessed. However, the Department of Social Protection states in its
<a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Means-Assessment.aspx">Operational
Guidelines on Means Assessment</a> that an allowance should be made where a
person has significant maintenance expenses, such as nursing home costs, which
are met out of interest payments. In such cases, only the interest on the
exempted capital (up to a maximum of €190,500) may be disregarded as
means.</p>

<p><strong>Leaving your home but not selling</strong> <br>
If, due to old age or incapacity, you leave your home either on a temporary
basis or indefinitely, the value of your home will not be assessed as means.
However, if it is put to profitable use (for example, rented out), the capital
value of the house will then be assessed as means.</p>

<h3>Total means</h3>

<p>Your means under the various headings are added together to see what level
of pension, if any, you can get. If you are one half of a couple (married
couple, civil partners or a cohabiting couple of the same or opposite sex) then
your means are taken to be half of the total means of yourself and your spouse,
civil partner or cohabitant. Note that you can have savings or assets of up to
€20,000 and earnings of up to €200 per week from employment and still
qualify for a full State Pension (Non-Contributory). </p>

<p>The first €30 per week of means as assessed by the Department of Social
Protection does not affect the rate of pension. After that, the pension is
reduced by €2.50 each week for every €2.50 of means.</p>

<p>If you were getting Farm Assist and the different means test that applies to
the State Pension (Non-Contributory) results in you getting a lower level of
payment, you keep your entitlement to the higher amount.</p>

<h3>Married, civil partners and cohabiting couples</h3>

<p>When your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant reaches 66 you will no longer
get an increase in your payment for them as a qualified adult. However, he or
she may apply for a State Pension (Non-Contributory) in his/her own right. </p>

<p>From 27 September 2007, if you are getting State Pension (Non-Contributory)
the <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">Increase
for a Qualified Adult</a> will be paid directly to your adult dependant.
<strong>This only applies to applications for state pensions received by the
Department of Social Protection after 27 September 2007</strong>. </p>

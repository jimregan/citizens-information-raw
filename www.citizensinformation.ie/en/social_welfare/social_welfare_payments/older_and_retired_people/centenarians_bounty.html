<p>The Centenarian Bounty is a national award made by the Irish president to
people who have reached 100 years of age. </p>

<p>The Centenarian Bounty is usually awarded on behalf of the President by a
local member of the clergy or friend of the centenarian. A letter of
congratulations signed by the President accompanies the award. The centenarian
can also request that the letter and the President's bounty be sent directly to
themselves without a presentation ceremony. </p>

<p>From 1 January 2000, the President has also marked the birthday of each
person resident in Ireland over the age of 100 years. On his or her 101st and
every subsequent birthday, the person receives a special commemorative coin in
a presentation box, along with a congratulatory letter signed by the President.
A new coin is designed for each year. </p>

<h3>People living in Ireland and getting an Irish social welfare payment</h3>

<p>The Department of Social Protection (DSP) automatically forwards information
about people who are about to reach 100 and who are getting DSP pensions to the
office of the President. The office of the President then makes the award
directly to the individual. </p>

<h3>People living in Ireland but not getting an Irish social welfare
payment</h3>

<p>You should forward information about people (Irish nationals and foreign
nationals) resident in Ireland who are not receiving a social welfare pension
to the Pensions Section in the Department of Social Protection. The Department
will arrange for a social welfare inspector to verify the information. This may
involve a visit by the inspector. Once it has been verified that the person is
eligible for the bounty, the award will be made to them. </p>

<h3>People not living in Ireland</h3>

<p>You should forward information about Irish citizens born in the island of
Ireland and resident outside the State,using the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.president.ie/uploads/documents/Centenarian-Abroad-Application-Form-2012.pdf">application

<p>A range of payments are made to older people by the Department of Social
Protection and the Health Service Executive. If you are unsure whether or not
you would qualify for a payment, you should apply anyway.</p>

<p>Generally payments are made up of a personal payment for yourself and extra
amounts for your dependent spouse, civil partner or cohabitant and any
dependent children. A cohabitant is a person living in an intimate and
committed relationship with a person of the same or opposite sex who is not
that person’s spouse, civil partner, or a close relative.</p>

<p>You should apply to the Department of Social Protection for your pension at
least <strong>four months in advance</strong>.</p>

<h3>Changes to the qualifying age for State pensions</h3>

<p>The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 made a number of changes to the
qualifying age for State pensions. Since 2014, the qualifying age has been 66
and will rise to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028. So:</p>
<ul><li>If you were born on or after 1 January 1948 the minimum qualifying State
    pension age will be 66 (because the State Pension (Transition) is no longer
    paid).</li>
  <li>If you were born on or after 1 January 1955 the minimum qualifying State
    pension age will be 67.</li>
  <li>If you were born on or after 1 January 1961 the minimum qualifying State
    pension age will be 68.</li>
</ul><h2>Social insurance payments</h2>

<p>You need enough <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_classes.html">PRSI
contributions</a> to qualify for these payments. Apply to the Department of
Social Protection.</p>

<h4><strong>State Pension (Transition)</strong></h4>

<p><strong>Since 1 January 2014 the State Pension (Transition) is no longer
paid to new applicants.</strong> This means that there is a standard State
Pension age of 66 years for everyone. </p>

<h4><strong>State Pension (Contributory)</strong></h4>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/state_pension_contributory.html">State
Pension (Contributory)</a> is payable from the age of 66. You are allowed to
have income from any other source while you receive this pension, but both the
income and the pension are taxable.</p>

<p>There are a number of pro-rata State Pensions (Contributory) which are paid
at a lower rate. These were introduced to deal with issues that arose as a
result of people paying different types of social insurance contributions or
not paying contributions for various reasons. </p>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/234_National-Pensions-Framework.aspx">National
Pensions Framework</a> a number of other changes are planned to the qualifying
conditions for the State Pension (Contributory) from 2020. These changes do not
affect the State Pension (Non-Contributory). <br></p>

<h4><strong>Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory
Pension</strong></h4>

<p>You may be eligible for <a shape="rect" href="../death_related_benefits/widows_contrib_pension.html">Widow’s,
Widower’s or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension</a> if you are
widowed or a surviving civil partner, have not remarried or entered into a new
civil partnership, and are not cohabiting. You can transfer to the State
Pension (Contributory) at the age of 66.</p>

<h3>Means-tested payments</h3>

<p>Any means you may have, such as weekly income or savings, are taken into
account for these payments, but not your own home. You must also satisfy the <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitual
residence</a> condition. Apply to the Department of Social Protection.</p>

<h4><strong>State Pension (Non-Contributory)</strong></h4>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="state_pension_non_contributory.html">State Pension
(Non-Contributory)</a> is a payment for people aged 66 or over who do not
qualify for a State Pension (Contributory).</p>

<h4><strong>Widow’s, Widower’s or Surviving Civil Partner's
Non-Contributory Pension</strong></h4>

<p>If you are a widowed person or a surviving civil partner who is not entitled
to a Widow’s, Widower’s or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension,
has not remarried or entered into a new civil partnership, has no dependent
children and is not cohabiting, you may be eligible for a <a shape="rect" href="../death_related_benefits/widows_non_contrib_pen.html">Widow's, Widower's
or Surviving Civil Partner's Non-Contributory Pension</a>. This is a
means-tested payment. At age 66 you transfer to the State Pension
(Non-Contributory).</p>

<h3>Private pensions</h3>

<h4><strong>Occupational and personal pensions</strong></h4>

<p><a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/occupational_pensions.html">Occupational
pensions</a> are organised by employers to provide pensions to employees on
retirement or to surviving dependants on the death of an employee. Personal
pensions or <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/personal_retirement_savings_accounts.html">Personal
Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs)</a> are organised individually by
self-employed people or employed people who do not have an occupational pension
scheme.</p>

<p>You need to deal directly with the pension provider to find out exactly what
benefits your pension gives you. The Pensions Authority is the regulatory body
for occupational pensions and PRSAs. If you have a complaint, the Authority
will advise you about your rights. The Pensions Ombudsman investigates and
decides on complaints relating to occupational pensions and PRSAs. Generally,
you may have income from other sources, for example, from work, if you are
receiving a pension. There are some restrictions on people getting both a
pension and employment income from the public sector – you should check with
the pension provider.</p>

<h3>Other social welfare payments</h3>

<p>Apply to the Department of Social Protection for these payments.</p>

<h4><strong>Increase for Living Alone </strong></h4>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../extra_social_welfare_benefits/living_alone_allowance.html">Increase

entitled to have their spouse/partner travel free with them or may be entitled
to a Companion Pass on medical grounds. The <a shape="rect" href="../extra_social_welfare_benefits/free_travel.html">Free Travel Scheme</a>

<h4><strong>Carers</strong></h4>

you may qualify for a carer’s payment. More information is available in our
document on <a shape="rect" href="../carers/payments_to_carers.html">payments
to carers</a>.</p>

<h3>Housing</h3>

if your local authority operates a waiver scheme, you should contact them
directly.</p>

<h4><strong>Working in retirement</strong> </h4>

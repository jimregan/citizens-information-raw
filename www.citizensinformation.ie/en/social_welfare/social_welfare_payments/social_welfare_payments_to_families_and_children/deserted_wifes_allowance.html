<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Deserted Wife's Allowance is a means-tested payment made to women under 66
years without dependent children, who were deserted by their husband and who do
not qualify for <a href="deserted_wife_s_payments.html">Deserted Wife's
Benefit</a>. Deserted Wife's Allowance has been closed for new applications
since 2 January 1997 when the <a href="one_parent_family_payment.html">One
Parent Family Payment</a> was introduced. </p>

<p>Some women continue to receive Deserted Wife's Allowance because they
qualified for the payment before 2 January 1997 and have continued to meet the
qualifying criteria.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Deserted Wife's Allowance is a payment made to a woman deserted by her
husband and who did not qualify for Deserted Wife's Benefit (because there were
insufficient PRSI contributions recorded on either her own or her husband’s
insurance record before the date of desertion). Deserted Wife's Allowance is
paid until your 66th birthday. You can then apply for a <a href="../older_and_retired_people/state_pension_non_contributory.html">State
Pension (Non Contributory)</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">

week. It increases to €193 per week from 16 March 2017.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>It is no longer possible to apply for Deserted Wife's Allowance. The payment
has been closed to new applicants since January 1997. </p>

<p>If you are getting Deserted Wife's Allowance, you may be entitled to <a href="../extra_social_welfare_benefits/additional_social_welfare_benefits.html">extra
benefits</a> from the Department of Social Protection including Living Alone
Allowance and the Household Benefits Package when you turn 66. </p>

<p>You must always tell the Department of Social Protection if there are any <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/changes_that_can_affect_your_social_welfare_payment.html">changes
to your circumstances</a> while you are getting a Deserted Wife's Allowance. If
your means or circumstances change you may no longer qualify for the payment or
it may be reduced. This could mean that you have to <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/recovery_of_social_welfare_overpayments.html">repay
an overpayment</a>.</p>

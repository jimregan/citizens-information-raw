<p>The social welfare payment most identified with pregnancy and birth is <a shape="rect" href="maternity_benefit.html">Maternity Benefit</a>. This document
explains how pregnancy is treated if you are getting <a shape="rect" href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker’s Benefit</a>,
<a shape="rect" href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s
Allowance</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">Illness Benefit</a>,
<a shape="rect" href="one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent Family
Payment</a> or are on an <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/schemes_to_support_employment.html">employment
scheme</a>. </p>

<p></p>

<p>If you are pregnant and getting a social welfare payment, you can generally
continue to get your payment as long as you satisfy the conditions. You cannot
qualify for Maternity Benefit if you are unemployed and pregnant, unless your
contract of employment ends within 16 weeks of the week in which your baby is
due and you satisfy the PRSI contribution conditions. In this case, Maternity
Benefit is paid from the day after the date on your P45. If you do not qualify
for Maternity Benefit you may qualify for another social welfare payment. You
may be entitled to <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_two_social_welfare_payments.html">half-rate
Maternity Benefit</a> if you are getting certain social welfare payments (for
example, One-Parent Family Payment) and are in employment. </p>

<p>When your baby is born, if you do not qualify for Maternity Benefit, you may
be able to stay on your payment or you may qualify for another payment. If you
are working more than 19 hours a week on low pay and you have a family you may
qualify for <a href="family_income_supplement.html">Family Income Supplement
(FIS)</a>. In some cases FIS can be paid with Maternity Benefit. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l52099">Pregnancy and jobseeker's payments</h2>

<p>If you are pregnant you may continue to get a jobseeker's payment - either
Jobseeker’s Benefit (JB) or Jobseeker's Allowance. You are considered capable
of work unless, you have complications during your pregnancy or you are ill.
You must be available for and genuinely seeking work to get a jobseeker's
payment. This means that you must continue to look for work throughout your
pregnancy.</p>

<p>However, 4 weeks before your baby is due to be born and for 8 weeks after
the birth, you do <strong>not </strong>have to sign-on at your local social
welfare office and you do <strong>not</strong> have to prove that you are
seeking work. <strong>You must inform your Intreo Centre or local Social
Welfare Branch Office of your pregnancy.</strong></p>

<p>Your Jobseeker’s Benefit will only be paid for the number of weeks
remaining on your claim. If you no longer qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit you
can apply for Jobseeker’s Allowance. The rules for Jobseeker's Allowance are
similar to Jobseeker's Benefit but you will have to pass a means test. </p>

<p>When your baby is born you may qualify for an increase in your Jobseeker’s
Benefit or Allowance for your child. If you are parenting alone you may qualify
for the One Parent Family payment. You should contact your Intreo Centre or
local Social Welfare Branch Office to inform them of the birth.</p>

<h3>What if I am unemployed but don't qualify for a jobseeker's payment because
of illness during pregnancy?</h3>

<p>If you are sick or ill during your pregnancy you are not entitled to
Jobseeker's Allowance or Jobseeker's Benefit. You may get Illness Benefit if
you have worked and have enough social insurance contributions (see below). If
you are not entitled to Illness Benefit and your illness is expected to last
for more than 12 months you may be entitled to <a shape="rect" href="../disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability
Allowance</a>.</p>

<p>If you are pregnant and either not getting a social welfare payment or not
entitled to any of the above social welfare payments, you may get some
financial support under the <a shape="rect" href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allowance_scheme.html">Supplementary
Welfare Allowance Scheme</a>. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l2c625">Pregnancy and Illness Benefit</h2>

<p>If you are pregnant, unemployed and claiming Illness Benefit you will
continue to be paid Illness Benefit provided you have a condition other than
pregnancy to warrant your being on Illness Benefit. You must continue to send
in medical certificates to qualify for Illness Benefit.</p>

<p>You cannot use pregnancy itself as a medical reason to claim Illness
Benefit. However, medical complications arising from your pregnancy can satisfy
the medical criteria for Illness Benefit. When your baby is born you may
qualify for an increase in your Illness Benefit for a child dependant. You
should contact the Illness Benefit section to find out if you qualify.</p>

<h3 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title">Pregnant and on sick leave from
work</h3>

<p>If you are on sick leave from work and getting Illness Benefit immediately
before you are due to start your maternity leave, you will be paid Maternity
Benefit in the normal way if you satisfy the social insurance contributions.
</p>

<p>The social insurance contributions for Maternity Benefit and Illness Benefit
are not the same. Therefore, if you are in employment but on sick leave and not
getting Illness Benefit you may still qualify for maternity leave and Maternity
Benefit. However, you must satisfy the social insurance contributions.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="health_safety_benefit.html">Health and Safety
Benefit</a> is a weekly payment for employed women who are pregnant or
breastfeeding, and who are granted health and safety leave by their employer.

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l073f7">Pregnancy and One-Parent Family
Payment</h2>

<p>If you are pregnant and getting a One-Parent Family Payment, you will
continue to get the payment as long as you satisfy the conditions. When your
baby is born you will qualify for an increase in your payment for a child
dependant. If you are pregnant and do <strong>not</strong> have other children,
you are <strong>not</strong> entitled to One-Parent Family Payment until your
baby is born. </p>

<p>You may get half-rate Maternity Benefit with your One-Parent Family Payment
if you are employed and have enough social insurance contributions. If you are
not entitled to a One-Parent Family Payment and you have no other income you
may get some financial support under the <a shape="rect" href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allowance_scheme.html">Supplementary
Welfare Allowance Scheme</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld3853">Pregnancy and employment schemes</h2>

<p>If you are taking part in an employment scheme you have the full range of
statutory employment rights including <a href="../../../employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/maternity_leave.html">maternity
leave</a>. </p>

<p>If you become pregnant while on <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/schemes_to_support_employment.html">an
employment scheme</a> (Community Employment, Rural Social Scheme, Tús and
Gateway schemes) you are entitled to take 26 weeks’ maternity leave (you can
also take an additional 16 weeks of optional unpaid leave). If possible, you
will be supported to complete your 52 weeks of paid work on the same or another
project when you finish your maternity leave.</p>

<p>You should discuss with your sponsor the payment you qualify for while you
are on maternity leave. You may qualify for Maternity Benefit if you have
enough PRSI contributions. Otherwise, if your spouse or partner is getting a
social welfare payment, you may get a qualified adult increase on their
payment. You cannot continue to use your affordable childcare scheme while you
are on maternity leave.</p>

<p>If you are on <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/national_internship_scheme.html">JobBridge</a>
and you become pregnant, you can suspend your internship to take maternity
leave. When you return to complete your internship, you must confirm your
eligibility for it. You will not get the top up payment while you are on
maternity leave.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/BTWFD.aspx">Back to Work Family
Dividend (BTWFD)</a> scheme aims to help families to move from social welfare
into employment. It gives financial support to people with qualified children
who are in or take up employment or self-employment and as a result stop
claiming a jobseeker's payment or a one-parent family payment on or after 5
January 2015. </p>

<p>If you qualify for the scheme you will get a weekly payment for up to 2
years. You will be paid the equivalent of any <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_and_increase_in_your_payment_for_a_child_dependant.html">Increases
for Qualified Children</a> that were being paid on your jobseeker or one-parent
family payment (up to a maximum of 4 children) for the first year in
employment. Half that amount will be paid weekly for the second year.</p>

<p>To qualify, you and all members of your family (including your adult
dependant) must sign off all primary social welfare payments. The Back to Work
Family Dividend can be paid with Family Income Supplement and some other
non-primary social welfare payments. You can also claim certain short-term
illness and injury benefits with BTWFD for up to 36 days (see 'Other payments
and BTWFD' below). The <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitual
residence condition</a> applies to BTWFD.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You may be eligible for the Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) if you have
at least one <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_and_increase_in_your_payment_for_a_child_dependant.html">qualified
child</a> and are getting one of the following payments:</p>
<ul><li><a href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s
    Allowance</a> or <a href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker’s
    Benefit</a> for at least 12 months (312 days of unemployment) of which at
    least 6 months (156 days of unemployment) must have been in the last
  year</li>
  <li><a href="one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent Family Payment
    (OFP)</a></li>
  <li><a href="transition_from_ofp.html">Jobseeker’s Transitional
    payment</a> (paid to people who are not cohabiting with children aged
    between 7 and 13 years)</li>
</ul><p>You can combine time on a jobseeker’s payment with time spent on <a href="../back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">education</a>,
<a href="../../../education/vocational_education_and_training/fas_training_courses.html">training</a>
or <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Back-to-Work-Family-Dividend-.aspx#part2">employment</a>
schemes to meet the eligibility requirements. If you went from a qualifying
payment to an education, training or employment scheme and then find work you
can go directly onto the BTWFD scheme without having to sign back onto your
original payment.</p>

<p>You must exit one of the qualifying payments or schemes to qualify for
BTWFD. If you are not already in insurable employment or self-employment you
must take up employment within 4 weeks of leaving your original payment or
scheme. The employment must be in the State. </p>

<p>Note that if you were employed or self-employed and were getting OFP and
your OFP has stopped because your youngest child has reached the age limit you
may be eligible for BTWFD – if you do not sign onto another primary social
welfare payment. </p>

<p>The Back to Work Family Dividend can be paid with <a href="family_income_supplement.html">Family Income Supplement (FIS)</a> and
is not taken into account in the means test for FIS. It can also be paid if you
are getting an <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">Increase
for a Qualified Adult</a> on your payment for your spouse, civil partner or
cohabitant and they find work (and as a result you sign off your payment).
However, you must meet all the conditions above and the Back to Work Family
Dividend will be paid to you (as the recipient of the primary social welfare
payment).</p>

<h3>Other payments and BTWFD</h3>

<p>You are not eligible for BTWFD if you or your spouse, civil partner or
cohabitant is getting a primary social welfare payment or is on an employment
or training scheme. You cannot get BTWFD for a child on whose behalf an IQC or
IQA is being paid or who is getting a payment in their own right. BTWFD is not
paid together with the <a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_and_work/back_to_work_enterprise_allowance.html">Back
to Work Enterprise Allowance</a>.</p>

<p>BTWFD can be paid with the following payments (to you or your spouse, civil
partner or cohabitant):</p>
<ul><li>Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance</li>
  <li>Child Benefit</li>
  <li>Disablement Benefit and Death Benefit (under the OIB scheme)</li>
  <li>Domiciliary Care Allowance</li>
  <li>Family Income Supplement</li>
  <li>Exceptional and Urgent Needs payments under the SWA scheme</li>
  <li>Guardian’s Payment (non-contributory)</li>
  <li>Illness Benefit and Injury Benefit (under the OIB scheme) for 36 days</li>
  <li>Mortgage Interest Supplement</li>
  <li>Rent Supplement</li>
  <li>Widowed or Surviving Civil Partner Grant</li>
</ul><p>BTWFD is not assessed as means for Rent Supplement.</p>

<p>You can claim BTWFD and Illness Benefit or Injury Benefit (under the OIB
scheme) for 36 days (6 weeks). Your BTWFD will be suspended after the 36th day
of your Illness or Injury Benefit claim. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Duration of the scheme</h3>

<p>BTWFD will last for up to 2 years, if you remain in employment. If you claim
a primary social welfare payment at any time within the 2-year period, the
BTWFD payment will stop. If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant claims a
payment the BTWFD payment will also stop.</p>

<p>If you lose your job and claim a social welfare payment the BTWFD stops but
it may restart if you get a new job – to a maximum of 2 restarts per claim.

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>BTWFD is based on the standard Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC) rate of
€29.80. If you were getting a half-rate IQC with your payment you will get a
standard rate BTWFD. There is a ceiling of €119.20 per week (4 children). You
will be paid weekly by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) in arrears.</p>

<p>BTWFD is not taxable. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) is a payment for men and women under 66 who
are bringing children up without the support of a partner. To get this payment
you must meet certain conditions and you must satisfy a means test.</p>

<p>One-Parent Family Payment is a <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">taxable
source of income</a>. </p>

<p>A new <a href="back_to_work_family_dividend.html">Back to Work Family
Dividend</a> has been introduced for lone parent and long-term jobseeker
families with children who find or return to work from January 2015. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To qualify for a One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) you must: </p>
<ul><li>Be under 66 (at 66 you become eligible for a <a href="../older_and_retired_people/income_supports_for_older_people.html">State
    pension</a>)</li>
  <li>Be the parent, step-parent, adoptive parent or legal guardian of a
    relevant child (this means a child under the relevant age limit - see
  below)</li>
  <li>Be the main carer of at least one relevant child. The child must live
    with you. OFP is not payable if the parents have joint equal custody of a
    child or children. </li>
  <li>Have earnings of €425 or less per week </li>
  <li>Satisfy a means test </li>
  <li>Be <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitually
    resident</a> (certain people, in particular EU nationals who are considered
    migrant workers, are exempt from the habitual residence condition)</li>
  <li>Not be living with a spouse, civil partner or cohabiting</li>
</ul><p>If you are <strong>separated</strong>, <strong>divorced</strong> or
<strong>your civil partnership is dissolved</strong> you must:</p>
<ul><li>Have been living apart from your spouse or civil partner for at least 3
    months. This does not apply to cohabitants. </li>
  <li>Have made efforts to get maintenance from your spouse or civil partner
    (if your civil partner is the parent of the child/ren)</li>
  <li>Be inadequately maintained by your spouse or civil partner (if your civil
    partner is the parent of the child/ren)</li>
</ul><p>If your <strong>spouse or civil partner is in prison</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>He/she must have been sentenced to at least 6 months in prison or have
    spent at least 6 months in custody.</li>
</ul><p>If <strong>you were not married</strong> to the parent of your
child/children you <strong>do not</strong> need to seek maintenance from the
other parent when you first claim OFP. However you must make efforts to seek
maintenance from the other parent to continue to be eligible for OFP. </p>

<p>You can read more about what making an effort to seek maintenance means for
<a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/OperationalGuidelines/Pages/onepfp.aspx#guidesep">separated
parents</a> and for <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/OperationalGuidelines/Pages/onepfp.aspx#guideunm">unmarried
parents</a>. See also 'Liability to maintain family' below. </p>

<h3>Income from maintenance</h3>

<p>All income from maintenance is assessed as means. This includes maintenance
for you and maintenance to you for any of your children. If you are getting
maintenance from more than one person all the payments are added together and
the total is assessed as means. However, only half of your income from
maintenance will be deducted from your OFP. If you have housing costs, your
rent or mortgage repayment up to a maximum of €95.23 per week can be offset
against maintenance payments. Half the balance is then assessed as means. You
must provide proof of rent or mortgage payments. You can get more information
on <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/maintenance_and_social_welfare_payments.html">how
maintenance is assessed as means</a>. </p>

<h3>Liability to maintain family</h3>

<p>Men and women are required, under the law, to pay maintenance to a dependent
spouse, civil partner or former cohabitant and any dependent children who are
not living with them. These people are called 'liable relatives'. If you are a
liable relative and fail to pay enough maintenance to your ex-spouse, ex-civil
partner or former cohabitant and dependent child(ren), you must contribute to
the cost of the One-Parent Family Payment, which is paid to your family.</p>

<p>The Maintenance Recovery Unit of the Department of Social Protection will
contact the liable relative if they have not paid enough maintenance. You can
contact the Maintenance Recovery Unit on (071) 967 2599 for more information.
You can also find out more about <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/OperationalGuidelines/Pages/liabmainfam.aspx">‘Liability
to Maintain Family’</a>.</p>

<h2>One-Parent Family Payment and EU Regulations</h2>

<p>From 5 May 2005, <a shape="rect" href="/en/government_in_ireland/european_government/european_union.html">EU
citizens</a>, EEA citizens and Swiss nationals who are employed or
self-employed in Ireland and who are paying into the <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">Irish
social insurance system</a> <span>do not have to meet <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">the
habitual residence criteria</a></span> to qualify for One-Parent Family
Payment.</p>

<h3>One-Parent Family Payment and Deserted Wife's Benefit</h3>

<p>If you had to transfer from <a href="deserted_wife_s_payments.html">Deserted Wife’s Benefit</a> to
One-Parent Family Payment to be accepted as a participant on a Community
Employment Scheme, you can apply to have your entitlement to Deserted Wife's
Benefit restored. While Deserted Wife's Benefit is closed to new applicants, it
is still paid to those who had qualified for it before 2 January 1997.</p>

<p>The maximum weekly rate of payment for Deserted Wife’s Benefit is higher
than the maximum weekly rate of payment for One-Parent Family Payment. If you
qualify to have your entitlement to Deserted Wife’s Benefit restored you may
also be due arrears.</p>

<h2>Age limit for a relevant child</h2>

<p>To get a One-Parent Family Payment you must have at least
<strong>one</strong> relevant child below the relevant age limit. <strong>From
2 July 2015 the age limit is 7 years of age.</strong></p>

<h3>Exceptions to the age limits</h3>

<h4>Domiciliary Care Allowance</h4>

<p>If you are getting <a href="../disability_and_illness/domiciliary_care_allowance.html">Domiciliary
Care Allowance (DCA)</a> for a child, you qualify for OFP on behalf of that
child if you meet the other conditions. This means that you can apply for or
continue to claim OFP until the child reaches 16 or DCA stops. You will also
get an Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC) for any other children in the
family until they reach 18 (or 22 if in full-time education) while DCA (and
OFP) is in payment.</p>

<h4>Carer’s Allowance</h4>

<p>People parenting alone, who care for one of their children or for an adult
(such as a parent or a sibling) can now qualify for both OFP and <a href="../carers/half_rate_carers_allowance.html">half-rate Carer’s
Allowance</a>, provided that their youngest child is aged under 16 years. This
means that you can claim OFP and a half-rate Carer’s Allowance (CA) until
your youngest child turns 16 provided you continue to meet the conditions for
both schemes. You will also get an Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC) for any
other children in the family until they reach 18 (or 22 if in full-time
education) while CA and OFP is in payment.</p>

<p>If you were previously getting both OFP and half-rate CA, and were affected
by the OFP age change reforms, you are now eligible to re-apply for both
payments.</p>

<h4>Death of a spouse, partner or civil partner</h4>

<p>If you are a new claimant and you are parenting alone because of the death
of your spouse, partner or civil partner you may get OFP for 2 years from the
date of death provided your youngest child is under 18. You cannot be paid OFP
after your youngest child reaches 18 even if that is less than 2 years after
the date of death.</p>

<h4>Blind Pension</h4>

<p><a href="../disability_and_illness/blind_persons_pension.html">Blind
Pension</a> is payable with OFP. This means that a person who qualifies for OFP
and Blind Pension can get both payments at the full rate. People who qualify
for Blind Pension will be exempted from the age conditions for OFP. This means
that you can claim both Blind Pension and OFP (and any IQCs payable with both
Blind Pension and OFP) together until your youngest child is 16 years of age.
This provision is in effect from May 2015.</p>

<h3>What happens when my One Parent Family payment ends?</h3>

<p>The Department of Social Protection (DSP) will inform you of the date of
termination of your payment and will outline options under other schemes and
supports which may be available to you. The document <a href="transition_from_ofp.html">Transition from One-Parent Family
Payment</a> also outlines your options. You may qualify for the <a href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance_transition.html">Jobseeker's
Transitional payment.</a> This is a payment for people parenting alone whose
children are aged between 7 and 13 (inclusive). </p>

<p>In all cases you can get more information and advice about your options from
your <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Intreo-Centres-and-Local-and-Branch-Offices.aspx">local
Intreo centre or social welfare local office</a> or <a href="http://findaddress.citizensinformation.ie/service_finder/">Citizens
Information Centre</a>. </p>

<h2>One-Parent Family Payment and work</h2>

<p>You can work and get One-Parent Family Payment. The amount of payment you
get depends on your weekly means. </p>

<h4>Income disregards</h4>
<ul><li>The first €90 of your gross weekly earnings is not taken into account
    (or <em>disregarded</em>). This means that you can earn up to €90 per
    week and qualify for the full One-Parent Family Payment. </li>
  <li>Half the remainder of your gross earnings up to €425 per week is
    assessed as means. If you earn between €90 and €425 per week you may
    qualify for a reduced payment. <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Jobseekers-supports.aspx">SW 19 Social
    Welfare Rates of Payment booklet</a> shows the amount of OPF payable with
    your means.</li>
</ul><p>Social insurance contributions, superannuation/<a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/pensions/personal_retirement_savings_accounts.html">PRSA</a>
contributions and trade union subscriptions are <strong>not</strong> taken into
account in the assessment of earnings. However, your gross earnings must be
below €425 before any deductions are allowed. </p>

<h4>Additional supports</h4>

<p>You may qualify for Family Income Supplement (FIS), if you are working for
at least 19 hours a week (38 hours a fortnight). You can continue to claim
One-Parent Family Payment and your FIS payment is not counted as means. Find
out more about <a shape="rect" href="family_income_supplement.html">Family
Income Supplement</a>. </p>

<p>If you want to become self-employed, you may qualify for the <a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_and_work/back_to_work_enterprise_allowance.html">Back
to Work Enterprise Allowance</a>. People on One-Parent Family Payment are also
eligible for <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/national_internship_scheme.html">JobBridge
- the National Internship Scheme</a>. </p>

<p>From 16 January 2012 new participants on <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/community_employment_scheme.html">CE
schemes</a> cannot get OFP at the same time. However if you take part in a CE
scheme and return immediately to OFP from the CE scheme your entitlement is
based on your original start date.</p>

<h3>If your pay from work is reduced </h3>

<p>You may be entitled to an increase in your One-Parent Family Payment if your
pay is reduced. To get an increase in your One-Parent Family Payment send a
current payslip (showing your reduced pay) with a letter from your employer,
confirming your new work situation, to the Intreo centre or social welfare
local office dealing with your claim.</p>

<p>If your pay is reduced and you are getting Family Income Supplement (FIS),
your FIS payment will stay the same. If the number of hours you work each week
is reduced to below 19 hours (38 hours per fortnight) you are no longer
entitled to FIS. You should notify the FIS section if the hours you work fall
below the minimum requirement. </p>

<p>You may be entitled to an increase in your <a shape="rect" href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/calculating_rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a>. If you rent from a local authority or housing association you
should contact them to find out if you are entitled to a reduction in your
rent. If you are not getting a medical card or GP visit card you should find
out if you now qualify.</p>

<h3>Credited contributions</h3>

<p>If you were receiving Maternity Benefit immediately before getting OFP you
will get credited contributions. You can read more about <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/One-Parent-Family-Payment.aspx#part3">credited
contributions in the Operational Guidelines for OFP</a>. </p>

<p></p>

<h2>One Parent Family Payment and education or training </h2>

<p>You will need to assess whether it is more beneficial for you to transfer
from the One-Parent Family Payment to the <a href="../back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">Back to
Education Allowance (BTEA)</a> when you go back to education or to remain on
your current payment and apply for a student grant. </p>

<p>From 4 July 2013 if you returned to education and had opted to keep your
One-Parent Family Payment (instead of BTEA) you may be admitted to BTEA
‘mid-course’ if you no longer qualify for OFP because of recent changes in
the age limits. <strong>However you cannot get BTEA and a student grant
together.</strong> Read more in our document on <a href="../back_to_education/social_welfare_payments_and_the_student_maintenance_grant_for_the_2010_11_academic_year.html">social
welfare payments and student grants</a>.</p>

<p>You could do a <a href="../../../education/vocational_education_and_training/fas_training_programmes_and_supports/fas_training_courses.html">FET
(formerly FÁS) training course</a> and keep your One-Parent Family Payment.
New applicants from 2014 no longer get a training allowance for these courses.
If you were on a training course before the end of 2013 you may continue to
keep the training allowance. However your OFP is reduced as your <a href="../../../education/vocational_education_and_training/fas_training_programmes_and_supports/fas_training_allowances.html">training
allowance</a> is assessed against it as income. </p>

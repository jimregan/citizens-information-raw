<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Paternity Benefit is a payment for employed and self-employed people who are
on <a href="../../../employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/paternity_leave.html">paternity
leave</a> from work and covered by <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social
insurance (PRSI)</a>. It is paid for 2 weeks and is available for any child
born or adopted on or after 1 September 2016. You can start paternity leave at
any time within the first 6 months following the birth or adoption
placement.</p>

<p>You should apply for the payment 4 weeks <span>before</span> you intend to
go on paternity leave (12 weeks if you are self-employed). </p>

<p>If you are already on certain social welfare payments then you may get
half-rate Paternity Benefit. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Paternity-Benefit-FAQ.aspx">You can
read detailed Frequently Asked Questions about Paternity Benefit on the
Department of Social Protection's website. </a></p>

<h3>Appeals</h3>

<p>You have the right to appeal the decision made on your Paternity Benefit
claim. You can get detailed information about <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_welfare_appeals.html">making
an appeal</a> from the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You must notify your employer that you intend to take paternity leave and of
your intended dates no later than 4 weeks before your leave. You must provide
proof of the expected date of birth of your child. Generally you will need to
provide a certificate from your spouse or partner's doctor confirming when your
baby is due, or, confirmation of the actual date of birth if you are applying
for leave after the birth. </p>

<p>You should apply for Paternity Benefit at least 4 weeks before the date you
intend to start your paternity leave. If you are self-employed you should apply
12 weeks before. You must register for a <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/public_services_card.html">Public
Services Card</a> (if you don't already have one) and register with the <a href="https://www.mywelfare.ie/Account/Login">mywelfare.ie service</a> (see
'How to apply' below for details of how to do this). </p>

<p>You must also satisfy the PRSI contribution conditions. </p>

<h3>PRSI contribution conditions</h3>

<p>Paternity Benefit is paid by the Department of Social Protection to people
who have a certain number of paid PRSI contributions on their social insurance
record. The PRSI contributions can be from both employment and self-employment.
The PRSI classes that count for Paternity Benefit are A, E, H and S
(self-employed). Members of the Defence Forces who pay PRSI at Class H are
insured for Paternity Benefit but it is not payable while they are in
service.</p>

<p><strong>If you are an employee </strong>you must have:</p>
<ul><li>At least 39 weeks PRSI paid in the 12-month period before the first day
    of your paternity leave. </li>
</ul><p><span>Or </span></p>
<ul><li>At least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work <span>and</span> at
    least 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year or in the tax
    year immediately following the relevant tax year. For example, if you are
    going on paternity leave in 2017, the relevant tax year is 2015 and the
    year following that is 2016. </li>
</ul><p><span>Or</span> </p>
<ul><li>At least 26 weeks PRSI paid in the relevant tax year <span>and</span> at
    least 26 weeks PRSI paid in the tax year immediately before the relevant
    tax year. For example, if you are going on paternity leave in 2017, the
    relevant tax year is 2015 and the year before that is 2014. </li>
</ul><p>If you do not meet these PRSI conditions and you were self-employed before
starting work as an employee, you can use your Class S contributions to qualify
for Paternity Benefit - see PRSI conditions for self-employed people below.</p>

<p>You are awarded <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">credited
contributions or credits</a> automatically when you are getting Paternity
Benefit. Credits are awarded at the same rate as your last paid contribution.
These credits help protect your future entitlement to social welfare benefits
and pensions.</p>

<p>If you were previously insurably employed in a country covered by EU
Regulations, you may combine your insurance record in that country with your
Irish PRSI contributions to help you qualify for Paternity Benefit in Ireland.
You must be currently in insurable employment in Ireland and have paid your
most recent PRSI contribution in Ireland. More information is available in our
document about <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/social_insurance_contributions_from_abroad.html">combining
your social insurance contributions from abroad</a>.</p>

<p><strong>If you are self-employed</strong> you must be in insurable
employment and have: </p>
<ul><li>52 weeks PRSI contributions paid at Class S in the relevant tax year. For
    example, if you are going on paternity leave in 2017, the relevant tax year
    is 2015. </li>
</ul><p><span>Or </span></p>
<ul><li>52 weeks PRSI contributions paid at Class S in the tax year immediately
    before the relevant tax year. For example, if you are going on paternity
    leave in 2017, the tax year immediately before the relevant tax year is
    2014. </li>
</ul><p><span>Or</span> </p>
<ul><li>52 weeks PRSI contributions paid at Class S in the tax year immediately
    following the relevant tax year. For example, if you are going on paternity
    leave in 2017, the tax year immediately following the relevant tax year is
    2016. </li>
</ul><p>If you do not meet these PRSI conditions and you were in insurable
employment before becoming self-employed, you can use your PRSI contributions
(Class A, E and H) in that employment to qualify for Paternity Benefit – see
PRSI conditions for employed people above. </p>

<p>If you are in insurable self-employment, you are not awarded credited
contributions or credits automatically when you are getting Paternity Benefit.
A self-employed person is not specifically excluded from employment credits.
You may qualify for credits if you meet the conditions. For example, an
applicant for Paternity Benefit who is now self-employed but had been employed
in 2015 would qualify for credits. If they have been only self-employed,
without being employed, for the last 3 years they won’t qualify for
credits.</p>

<h3>If you are already getting a social welfare payment</h3>

<p>Half-rate Paternity Benefit may be payable if you are getting any one of the
following payments: </p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent Family
    Payment</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../death_related_benefits/widows_contrib_pension.html">Widower's and
    Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../death_related_benefits/widows_non_contrib_pen.html">Widower's and
    Surviving Civil Partner's (Non-Contributory) Pension</a> </li>
  <li>Death Benefit by way of Widow's/Widower's/Surviving Civil Partner's or
    Dependent Parents' Pension (under the Occupational Injuries Scheme)</li>
</ul><p>If you are providing full-time care to another person, you may qualify for
<a shape="rect" href="../carers/half_rate_carers_allowance.html">half-rate
Carer's Allowance</a> with your Paternity Benefit. </p>

<h3>Leave certification</h3>

<p>All employees must have their paternity leave certified by their employer.
If you are self-employed you self-certify your leave. </p>

<p>If you're an employee, you must provide your employer with proof of the
expected date of confinement of your spouse or partner. In other words, you
will be required to provide your employer with a certificate from your spouse
or partner's doctor confirming when your baby is due, or confirmation of the
baby’s actual date of birth if you apply for leave after the birth has
occurred. Your employer must then complete a <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/PB2.pdf">form PB2: Employer Certificate for
Paternity Benefit (pdf)</a> to confirm that you are entitled to paternity
leave.</p>

<p>If you're self-employed, a doctor must complete a <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/PB3.pdf">form PB3: Medical Certificate for
Paternity Benefit (pdf)</a> to certify the expected due date of your baby (or
the baby's date of birth). This is to confirm that you are entitled to
paternity leave.</p>

<p>In the case of adoption, you must produce a certificate of placement in
relation to the child.</p>

<p>In the case of an intercountry adoption that took place outside the
State,you must produce a declaration of eligibility and suitability in relation
to the child and particulars in writing of the day of placement or expected day
of placement.</p>

<p>If, at any stage you decide not to take your paternity leave, you cannot be
paid Paternity Benefit. You should inform the Paternity Benefit section of the

<h3>Duration of Paternity Benefit</h3>

<p>Paternity Benefit is paid for 2 weeks and the 2 weeks must be taken
consecutively.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>From 13 March 2017: Paternity Benefit is €235 per week.</p>

<h3>Payments for dependants</h3>

<p>If you have dependants your rate of Paternity Benefit (excluding increases
for dependants) is compared to the rate of Illness Benefit (including increases
for dependants) that would be paid to you if you were absent from work through
illness. The higher of the 2 rates is paid to you.</p>

<p>Although the Illness Benefit rate begins from a lower personal base amount
(€193 is the maximum Illness Benefit personal rate), it also takes into
account extra payments for your family. This is why, depending on the
circumstances of your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant and how many children
you have, the rate paid to you may be greater than the rate you would otherwise
be entitled to.</p>

<p><strong>Example (March 2017 rates):</strong> John is entitled to the
standard Paternity Benefit rate of €235. His partner is unemployed and
signing on for <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">unemployment
credits</a>. They have 2 children. If he got <a shape="rect" href="../disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">Illness Benefit</a> he
would get €380.70 (this is the personal rate of Illness Benefit + an Increase
for a Qualified Adult + Increases for 2 Qualified Children). He cannot get less
Paternity Benefit than he would get if ill and getting Illness Benefit. For
this reason, he will get Paternity Benefit of €380.70.</p>

<p>If your adult dependant is getting a social welfare payment you will not get
an <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">Increase
for a Qualified Adult (IQA)</a> but you may get a half-rate <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_and_increase_in_your_payment_for_a_child_dependant.html">Increase
for a Qualified Child (IQC)</a>.</p>

<p>You will qualify for a full-rate IQA and a full-rate IQC, if your adult
dependant is unemployed and signing on for credits or is earning under
€100.01 per week.</p>

<p>If your adult dependant is earning between €100.01 and €310 per week you
will get a tapered rate of IQA and a full-rate IQC. If your adult dependant is
earning between €310.01 and €400 per week you will not get an IQA but you
will get half rate IQC. If your adult dependant earns over €400 per week you
will not get an IQA or IQC.</p>

<h3>Payment abroad</h3>

<p>EU and non-EU citizens can holiday abroad and get Paternity Benefit for a
maximum of 2 weeks while away.</p>

<p>To get Paternity Benefit while abroad, you need to inform Paternity Benefit
Section of your intended absence either by email at: paternityben@welfare.ie or
by calling 01 471 58 98 or Lo-call: 1890 690 690.</p>

<h3>How the payment is made</h3>

<p>Paternity Benefit is paid directly into your bank or building society
account (a current or deposit account, not a mortgage account) or you can
choose to have it paid directly into your employer's bank account. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some employers will continue to pay an employee, in
full, while the employee is on paternity leave. In such cases the employer will
generally require the employee to have any Paternity Benefit paid to them. You
should check your contract of employment to see what applies to you. </p>

<h3>Taxation of Paternity Benefit</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/personal/faqs/taxation-welfare-benefits.html#section5">Paternity
Benefit is taxable for all claimants</a>. Universal Social Charge and PRSI are
not payable. You can read about how Paternity Benefit is taxed in the document,
<a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">Taxation

<h3>Premature births</h3>

<p>If your baby is born prematurely (before your Paternity Leave and Paternity
Benefit is due to begin) and you wish to change your leave dates, you should
send a letter from your employer confirming the new leave dates and the date of
birth of your child to the Paternity Benefit section of the Department of
Social Protection. If you are self-employed you must send a letter to the
Paternity Benefit section stating your new leave dates and a letter from a
doctor or the hospital confirming the date of birth of your child.</p>

<h3>Stillbirths and miscarriages</h3>

<p>If there is a stillbirth or miscarriage any time after the 24th week of
pregnancy (i.e. from the beginning of the 25th week) and you are entitled to
paternity leave, you are entitled to 2 weeks Paternity Benefit provided you
satisfy the social insurance (PRSI) requirements.</p>

<p>To apply for Paternity Benefit following a stillbirth, you need to send a
letter from your doctor with the Paternity Benefit application form, confirming
the expected date of birth, the actual date of birth and the number of weeks of
pregnancy.</p>

<p>The leave must still be certified by your employer or self-certified if you
are self-employed.</p>

<h3>Hospitalisation of baby</h3>

<p>If your baby is in hospital you can postpone your paternity leave and
Paternity Benefit or whatever portion of it remains for a maximum of 6 months.
If you are an employee and you wish to change your leave dates because of the
hospitalisation of your baby, you should send a letter from your employer
confirming the new leave dates to the Paternity Benefit section of the
Department of Social Protection. If you are self-employed and you wish to
change your leave dates because of the hospitalisation of your baby, you must
send a letter to the Paternity Benefit section stating your new leave dates and
a letter from a doctor or the hospital confirming the date of birth of your
child.</p>

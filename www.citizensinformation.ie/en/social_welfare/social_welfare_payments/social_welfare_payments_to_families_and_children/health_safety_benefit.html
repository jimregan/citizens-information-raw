<p>Health and Safety Benefit is a weekly payment for employed women who are
pregnant or breastfeeding, and who are granted health and safety leave by their
employer. </p>

<p>You are granted health and safety leave from employment if your employer
cannot remove a risk to your health while you are pregnant, or breastfeeding,
or assign you alternative "risk-free" duties. The right to <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/health_and_safety/health_safety_work.html">health
and safety leave</a> from employment is set out under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0034/sec0018.html#zza34y1994s18">Section
18 of the Maternity Protection Act 1994</a>. </p>

<p>To qualify for Health and Safety Benefit, you must meet certain criteria and
social insurance (PRSI) contribution conditions. Your employer pays your normal
wage for the first 21 days (3 weeks) of your health and safety leave and the
Department of Social Protection pays Health and Safety Benefit for the
remainder.</p>

<p>If you think you have been wrongly refused Health and Safety Benefit you can
<a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system_appeals.html">appeal
this decision</a>. </p>

<p>During health and safety leave from employment, you are still considered to
be in employment (this means, for example, that you continue to accumulate
annual leave entitlement). However you are not entitled to payment for public
holidays that occur while you are on health and safety leave. </p>

<h3>Taxation of Health and Safety Benefit</h3>

<p>Health and Safety Benefit is taxable for all claimants. It is taxed in the
same way as Maternity Benefit. Universal Social Charge and PRSI are not
payable. You can read about how Maternity Benefit is taxed in the document, <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">Taxation
of social welfare payments</a>. You can also get more information from Revenue
on <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/personal/faqs/taxation-welfare-benefits.html#section4">taxation
of Maternity Benefit.</a> </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To get Health and Safety Benefit you must:</p>
<ul><li>Be a pregnant employee who is exposed to certain risks in the workplace
    or is a nightworker (that is, you must spend at least 3 hours or 25% of
    your work between 11pm and 6am) <strong>or</strong></li>
  <li>Have given birth in the last 14 weeks and be involved in
    <span>nightwork</span> <strong>or</strong></li>
  <li>Be breastfeeding (up to 26 weeks after the birth) and exposed to certain
    risks in the workplace. The Health and Safety Authority provides <a href="http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Publications_and_Forms/Publications/Retail/Gen_Apps_Pregnant_Post_Natal.pdf">full
    details of what these risks (pdf)</a> are. </li>
</ul><p>You must also meet the following PRSI conditions: </p>
<ol><li>Have at least 13 weeks of <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social
    insurance (PRSI)</a> paid in the 12 months immediately before the date your
    baby is due <span><strong>or</strong> </span></li>
  <li>Have 104 weeks' PRSI paid since you first started work
    <strong>and</strong> 39 weeks' PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax
    year or in the year following the relevant tax year (of which at least 13
    must be paid contributions) <span><strong>or</strong> </span></li>
  <li>Have 104 weeks' PRSI paid since you first started work and 26 weeks' PRSI
    paid in the relevant tax year and 26 weeks' PRSI paid in the tax year
    before the relevant tax year </li>
</ol><p>The <em>relevant tax year</em> is the second last complete tax year before
you claim Health and Safety Benefit. For example, for claims made in 2017 the
relevant tax year is 2015. </p>

<h3>How long is Health and Safety Benefit paid?</h3>

<p>Health and Safety Benefit lasts until:</p>
<ul><li>The day you become entitled to Maternity Benefit, if you are pregnant
  </li>
  <li>14 weeks from the date on which you gave birth, if you are an employee
    who has recently given birth and do nightwork </li>
  <li>26 weeks from the date on which you gave birth, if you are breastfeeding
  </li>
</ul><p>You stop getting Health and Safety Benefit if your health and safety leave
ends because: </p>
<ul><li>You are no longer at risk in the workplace <strong>or</strong> </li>
  <li>Your employer has removed the risk or given you other work
    <strong>or</strong> </li>
  <li>You are employed on a fixed-term contract and that contract expires. </li>

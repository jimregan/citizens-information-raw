<p>The Department of Social Protection provides social welfare payments to
support families and specifically children. There are many different types of
families and social welfare payments are designed to support those most in need
of financial assistance. <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/family_benefits_and_entitlements.html">Find
out more about the broad range of rights and entitlements for families</a>.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="child_benefit.html">Child Benefit</a> is the most
common payment to families with children. You are entitled to it if you have
dependent children that meet the criteria.</p>

<p><strong>Other payments depend on your family circumstances and other
factors, such as whether you have enough <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">PRSI
contributions</a> or you are on a low income.</strong></p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="maternity_benefit.html">Maternity Benefit</a> is paid
for 26 weeks to women who are on maternity leave from work and who have paid a
certain amount of PRSI (Pay Related Social Insurance). </p>

<p><a href="paternity_benefit.html">Paternity Benefit</a> is a payment paid
to people on paternity leave from work who have paid a certain amount of PRSI.
It is available for any child born or adopted on or after 1 September 2016. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="health_safety_benefit.html">Health and Safety
Benefit</a> is paid to a woman who has sufficient PRSI contributions and is
granted Health and Safety Leave from employment. You may be granted leave if
your employer cannot remove a risk to your health while you are pregnant,
breastfeeding or involved in night-work, or assign you alternative "risk-free"
duties.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="adoptive_benefit.html">Adoptive Benefit</a> is paid
for 24 weeks to an adopting mother or a sole male who adopts a child. You must
satisfy certain social insurance (PRSI) contribution conditions on your own
insurance record. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent Family
Payment</a> (OPF) is paid to men and women who are bringing children up without
the support of a partner. You must satisfy a means test and a habitual
residence test. If you are working you may also get a <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/one_parent_family_tax_credits_and_reliefs.html">Single
Person Child Carer Credit</a> if you meet the criteria. You do not have to get
OPF to claim this tax credit.</p>

<p><a href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance_transition.html">Jobseeker's
Transitional payment</a> is a special payment for lone parents whose youngest
child is aged between 7 and 13 years.</p>

<p>A social welfare payment can be paid to the person taking care of an <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/death_related_benefits/guardians_payments.html">orphaned
child</a> up to 18 years of age or up to 22 if he or she is in full-time
education. There are three different payments and a child or their guardian may
qualify for one of these payments if both parents are dead, or one parent is
dead or failed to provide for the child and the other parent is unknown, or has
abandoned or failed to provide for the child. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="family_income_supplement.html">Family Income
Supplement</a> (FIS) is a weekly tax-free payment available to employees with
children. To qualify you must have at least one child who normally lives with
you or is financially supported by you and your net average weekly family
income must be below a certain amount for your family size.</p>

<p>The <a href="back_to_work_family_dividend.html">Back to Work Family
Dividend</a> scheme aims to help families to move from social welfare into
employment. It gives financial support to people with qualified children who
take up employment or self-employment and as a result stop claiming a
jobseeker's payment or a one-parent family payment. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="back_to_school_clothing_and_footwear_allowance.html">Back to School
Clothing and Footwear Allowance</a> is designed to help meet the cost of
uniforms and footwear for students attending school. The scheme operates from
June to September each year. To qualify, your total household income must be
below a certain amount or you must be getting certain social welfare
payments.</p>

<p>Deserted wife's payment is paid to women who were deserted by their husband
and have no dependent children. This scheme was closed to new applications in
January 1997.</p>

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Maternity Benefit is a payment made to women who are on maternity leave from
work and covered by <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social
insurance (PRSI)</a>. You should apply for the payment 6 weeks
<span>before</span> you intend to go on maternity leave (12 weeks if you are
self-employed). If you are already on certain social welfare payments then you
may get half-rate Maternity Benefit. If you think you have been wrongly refused
Maternity Benefit or you are unhappy about a decision of a Social Welfare
Deciding Officer about your entitlements, you can <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system_appeals.html">appeal this decision</a>.
</p>

<p>Some employers will continue to pay an employee, in full, while she is on
maternity leave and require her to have any Maternity Benefit paid to them. You
should check your contract of employment to see what applies to you. </p>

<h3>Paternity Benefit</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2016/4316/b43b16d.pdf">Paternity
Leave and Benefit Bill 2016 (pdf)</a> proposes to introduce a new Paternity
Benefit together with <a href="../../../employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/paternity_leave.html">statutory
paternity leave</a> of 2 weeks. When enacted, the legislation will allow new
fathers to start the combined package of paternity leave and paternity benefit
at any time within the first six months following birth or adoption of a child.
The provisions will apply to births and adoptions on or after 1 September
2016.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Taxation of Maternity Benefit</h3>

<p>Maternity Benefit is taxable from 1 July 2013 for all claimants. Universal
Social Charge and PRSI are not payable. You can read about how Maternity
Benefit is taxed in the document, <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">Taxation
of social welfare payments</a>. You can also get more information from Revenue
on <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/personal/faqs/taxation-welfare-benefits.html#section4">taxation
of Maternity Benefit.</a> </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Maternity Benefit is paid by the Department of Social Protection to women
who have a certain number of paid PRSI contributions on their social insurance
record and who are in insurable employment up to the first day of their
maternity leave. </p>

<p>The PRSI contributions can be from both employment or self-employment - the
PRSI classes that count for Maternity Benefit are A, E, H and S
(self-employed). Maternity Benefit is not payable to serving members of the
Defence Forces who pay PRSI at Class H.</p>

<p><span><strong>If you are employed</strong> you must have:</span> </p>
<ul><li>At least 39 weeks PRSI paid in the 12-month period before the first day
    of your maternity leave </li>
</ul><p><span>Or </span></p>
<ul><li>At least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work <span>and</span> at
    least 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year or in the tax
    year immediately following the relevant tax year. For example, if you are
    going on maternity leave in 2016, the relevant tax year is 2014 and the
    year following that is 2015. </li>
</ul><p><span>Or</span> </p>
<ul><li>At least 26 weeks PRSI paid in the relevant tax year <span>and</span> at
    least 26 weeks PRSI paid in the tax year immediately before the relevant
    tax year. For example, if you are going on maternity leave in 2016, the
    relevant tax year is 2014 and the year before that is 2013. </li>
</ul><p>If you do not meet these PRSI conditions and you were self-employed before
starting work as an employee, you can use your Class S contributions to qualify
for Maternity Benefit - see PRSI conditions for self-employed people below.</p>

<p><span><strong>If you are </strong><strong>self-employed</strong> you must be
in insurable employment and have:</span> </p>
<ul><li>52 weeks PRSI contributions paid at Class S in the relevant tax year. For
    example, if you are going on maternity leave in 2016, the relevant tax year
    is 2014. </li>
</ul><p><span>Or </span></p>
<ul><li>52 weeks PRSI contributions paid at Class S in the tax year immediately
    before the relevant tax year. For example, if you are going on maternity
    leave in 2016, the tax year immediately before the relevant tax year is
    2013. </li>
</ul><p><span>Or</span> </p>
<ul><li>52 weeks PRSI contributions paid at Class S in the tax year immediately
    following the relevant tax year. For example, if you are going on maternity
    leave in 2016, the tax year immediately following the relevant tax year is
    2015. </li>
</ul><p>PRSI Class S contributions for a particular year are not awarded until you
have paid tax due for that year. Your income tax and PRSI liabilities
(primarily for the relevant tax year) must be paid to qualify for Maternity
Benefit.</p>

<p>If you do not meet these PRSI conditions and you were in insurable
employment before becoming self-employed, you can use your PRSI contributions
(Class A, E and H) in that employment to qualify for Maternity Benefit – see
PRSI conditions for employed people above. </p>

<h3>Insurance from employment in another country</h3>

<p>If you were previously insurably employed in a country covered by EU
Regulations and you have paid at least one full rate PRSI contribution in
Ireland, you may combine your insurance record in that country with your Irish
PRSI contributions to help you qualify for Maternity Benefit. You must be in
insurable employment in Ireland currently and have paid your most recent PRSI
contribution in Ireland. </p>

<p>More information is available in our document about <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/social_insurance_contributions_from_abroad.html">combining
your social insurance contributions from abroad</a>.</p>

<h3>If you are already getting a social welfare payment</h3>

<p>Half-rate Maternity Benefit may be payable if you are getting any one of the
following payments: </p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent Family
    Payment</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../death_related_benefits/widows_contrib_pension.html">Widow's and
    Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../death_related_benefits/widows_non_contrib_pen.html">Widow's and
    Surviving Civil Partner's (Non-Contributory) Pension</a> </li>
  <li>Deserted Wife's Benefit or Allowance</li>
  <li>Prisoner's Wife's Allowance </li>
  <li>Death Benefit by way of Widow's/Widower's/Surviving Civil Partner's or
    Dependent Parents' Pension (under the Occupational Injuries Scheme)</li>
</ul><p>If you are providing full-time care to another person, you may qualify for
<a shape="rect" href="../carers/half_rate_carers_allowance.html">half-rate
Carer's Allowance</a> with your Maternity Benefit. </p>

<p>Under the Maternity Protection Act 1994, a woman who qualifies for Maternity
Benefit is entitled to claim <a href="family_income_supplement.html">Family
Income Supplement (FIS)</a> (provided she meets the conditions of the FIS
payment and has a family – a pregnant woman who has no other children does
not qualify for FIS until the birth of the baby). </p>

<h3>Leave certification</h3>

<p>All employees must have their leave certified by their employer. However, if
your contract of employment ends within 16 weeks of the end of the week in
which your baby is due and you satisfy the social insurance (PRSI) conditions,
Maternity Benefit is payable from the day after the date on your <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/losing_your_job/losing_job_entitlements.html">P45</a>.</p>

<h3>Duration of Maternity Benefit</h3>

<p>Maternity Benefit is paid for 26 weeks (156 days). Maternity Benefit is a
6-day week payment which covers Monday to Saturday. Sunday is not treated as a
day of entitlement to Maternity Benefit.</p>

<p>At least 2 weeks and not more than 16 weeks leave must be taken before the
end of the week in which your baby is due<span>. To ensure you take the minimum
2-week period of maternity leave before the birth of your baby, you must start
your maternity leave on the Monday before the week in which your baby is due.
For example, if your due date is Wednesday 14 October 2015, the latest date for
the start of your maternity leave is Monday 5 October 2015.</span></p>

<p>You can take a further 16 weeks unpaid <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/maternity_leave.html">maternity
leave</a> which must be taken immediately after the end of your 26 weeks’
paid Maternity Benefit. This period is not covered by Maternity Benefit but you
will be entitled to a <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">credited
social insurance contribution</a> for each week of unpaid leave you take (up to
the maximum of 16).</p>

<h3>Premature births</h3>

<p>If your baby is born prematurely (before your maternity leave is due to
begin), you should send a letter from your doctor to the Maternity Benefit
section of the Department of Social Protection. The letter should confirm the
date the baby was born and that the baby was born prematurely. </p>

<h3>Stillbirths and miscarriages</h3>

<p>If you have a <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/miscarriage_and_stillbirth/bereavement_and_childbirth.html">stillbirth
or miscarriage</a> any time after the 24th week of pregnancy (i.e from the
beginning of the 25th week) you are entitled to 26 weeks maternity leave. You
are also entitled to 26 weeks Maternity Benefit provided you satisfy the social
insurance (PRSI) requirements.</p>

<p>To apply for Maternity Benefit following a stillbirth, you need to send a
letter from your doctor with the Maternity Benefit application form, confirming
the expected date of birth, the actual date of birth and the number of weeks of
pregnancy.</p>

<h3>Hospitalisation of baby</h3>

<p>If your baby is in hospital and you have been getting Maternity Benefit for
at least 14 weeks (including at least 4 weeks since your baby was born) you can
postpone payment of your remaining 12 weeks of benefit for up to 6 months. To
postpone payment of your Maternity Benefit you need to apply in writing to the
Maternity Benefit Section in the Department of Social Protection. When your
baby is discharged from hospital you must notify the Maternity Benefit Section
in writing and payment of your remaining 12 weeks Maternity Benefit will
continue within seven days.</p>

<h3>How the payment is made</h3>

<p>Maternity Benefit is paid directly into your bank or building society
account (a current or deposit account, not a mortgage account) or you can
choose to have it paid directly into your employer's bank account. Payment is
made each week in advance.</p>

<h3>Disqualification from Maternity Benefit</h3>

<p>You can do voluntary work, public representative work (for example, a
councillor or TD) and courses of education while you are getting Maternity
Benefit. However, your payment will be stopped if you engage in insurable
(paid) employment. </p>

<p>If you intend to return to employment earlier than you stated on your
application form, you must notify the Maternity Benefit Section <span>at least
2 weeks</span> before your new '<span>return to work date</span>'. </p>

<p>You will not be paid Maternity Benefit for any period you spend outside the
EU. If you are an EU citizen, you can get Maternity Benefit for any period of
your maternity leave spent in another EU country. You cannot receive payment
for any period of time spent outside the EU. If you are not an EU citizen you
will only get Maternity Benefit for periods you spend in the Republic of
Ireland.</p>

<p>If you do not apply for Maternity Benefit within 6 months of the birth of
your baby, you may lose benefit.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>For new Maternity Benefit claims <strong>from</strong> <strong>6 January
2014</strong> a standard rate of <strong>€230.00 per week</strong> is
paid.</p>

    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<h3>Payments for dependants</h3>

<p><span xml:lang="EN" lang="EN">If you have dependants your rate of Maternity
Benefit (excluding increases for dependants) is compared to the rate of Illness
Benefit (including increases for dependants) that would be paid to you if you
were absent from work through illness. The higher of the two rates is paid to
you. Although the Illness Benefit rate begins from a lower personal base amount
(€188 is the maximum Illness Benefit personal rate), it also takes into
account extra payments for your family, and this is why, depending on the
circumstances of your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant and how many children
you have, the rate paid to you may be greater than the rate to which you would
have otherwise been entitled.</span></p>

<p><span xml:lang="EN" lang="EN"><strong>Example (2016 rates):</strong> Mary is
entitled to the standard Maternity Benefit rate of €230. Her partner is
unemployed and signing on for <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">unemployment
credits</a>. They have two children. If she got <a shape="rect" href="../disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">Illness Benefit</a>
she would get €372.40 (this is the personal rate of Illness Benefit + an
Increase for a Qualified Adult + Increases for 2 Qualified Children). She
cannot get less Maternity Benefit than she would get if ill and getting Illness
Benefit. For this reason, she will get Maternity Benefit of
€372.40.</span></p>

<p><span xml:lang="EN" lang="EN">If your adult dependent is getting a social
welfare payment you will not get an <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">Increase
for a Qualified Adult (IQA)</a> but you may get a half-rate <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_and_increase_in_your_payment_for_a_child_dependant.html">Increase
for a Qualified Child (IQC)</a>.</span></p>

<p><span xml:lang="EN" lang="EN">You will qualify for a full-rate IQA and a
full-rate IQC, if your adult dependent is unemployed and signing on for credits
or is earning under €100.01 per week. </span></p>

<p><span xml:lang="EN" lang="EN">If your adult dependent is earning between
€100.01 and €310 per week you will get a tapered rate of IQA and a
full-rate IQC. If your adult dependent is earning between €310.01 and €400
per week you will not get an IQA but you will get half rate IQC. If your adult
dependent earns over €400 per week you will not get an IQA or IQC. </span></p>

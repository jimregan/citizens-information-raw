<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA) helps you meet
the cost of uniforms and footwear for children going to school.</p>

<p>You (the parent or guardian) must be getting <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Back-to-School-Clothing-and-Footwear-Allowance.aspx#l1f4da">certain
social welfare payments or taking part in training, employment or adult
education schemes</a> and your child/ren must be aged between 4 and 17 on or
before 30 September of the year you apply or aged between 18 and 22 on or
before 30 September if still in second-level education. </p>

<p><strong>This scheme for 2017 is now open. The closing date for applications
is 30 September 2017.</strong> </p>

<p>The Department of Social Protection pays BSCFA automatically to many
customers. This means that they do not have to apply for the payment. If you
qualify automatically, you should receive a letter stating when and how your
Allowance will be paid. (These customers will be notified of their entitlements
shortly. The payment will be made during the week ending 14 July.) </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You may qualify for the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance if
you are: </p>
<ul><li>Getting a social welfare payment (including <a href="family_income_supplement.html">Family Income Supplement</a> and <a href="back_to_work_family_dividend.html">Back to Work Family
    Dividend</a>) or a Health Service Executive payment, <strong>or</strong>
  </li>
  <li>Taking part in an <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/schemes_to_support_employment.html">approved
    employment scheme</a> (back to work scheme) including <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/national_internship_scheme.html">JobBridge</a>
    <strong>or</strong> </li>
  <li>Taking part in a recognised education or training course,
    <strong>or</strong></li>
  <li>Involved in an Area Partnership Scheme, <strong>or</strong> </li>
  <li>Attending a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.fas.ie/en/">FET (formerly
    Fás)</a>, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.failteireland.ie/">Fáilte
    Ireland</a> or LES training scheme </li>
</ul><p>Your child must be aged between 4-17 on or before 30 September 2017. If they
are aged between 18-22 they must be in <strong>full-time second-level
education</strong> in a recognised school or college.</p>

<p>In general you must be getting an <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_and_increase_in_your_payment_for_a_child_dependant.html">Increase
for a Qualified Child (IQC)</a> with your payment. There are some exceptions to
this. For example, you may be getting a qualifying payment but you are not
getting an increase for your child (because the rules of the scheme do not
provide for a child payment) – Maternity Benefit or Adoptive Benefit are
examples. In such cases you can still claim BSCFA if you satisfy the other
criteria. In other cases an IQC is not paid because the income of your spouse
or partner is over the specified limits but if your overall household income is
within the limits specified below you may qualify. You cannot claim BSCFA for a
child that is not resident in the State. Foster children are not eligible for
the BSCFA because the financial support parents get from Tusla - the Child and
Family Agency (Foster Care Allowance) includes help with the cost of clothing
and footwear for the child. </p>

<p><strong>Note that</strong> if you have applied for a social welfare payment
or have appealed a decision not to award you a social welfare payment and are
waiting for a decision on your application, you should apply for the BSCFA
before the scheme closes on 30 September 2017. Your entitlement will be
established when you get a decision on your application or appeal.</p>

<h3>Income limits</h3>

<p>To qualify for the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance, your
total household income must be less than the amounts set out in the table
below. All your dependent children are taken into account for the income limits
(including children who do not qualify for BSCFA, because they are under 4).</p>

<p>Your total household income includes your main social welfare or Health
Service Executive payment, the income of any dependent children on <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/vocational_education_and_training/training_and_apprentiship_programmes/youthreach.html">the
Youthreach Programme</a> and any other income you may have including wages
(before tax, but excluding <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_classes.html">PRSI</a>
and a standard travel allowance of up to €20 per week), maintenance, savings
and investments. </p>

<p><strong>Savings and investments</strong> (including property, but not your
home) are assessed as follows:</p>

<h3>Back to Education Allowance or VTOS</h3>

<p>If you are getting a <a shape="rect" href="../back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">Back to Education
Allowance</a> or <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/returning_to_education/vocational_training_opportunities_scheme.html">VTOS
allowance</a>, you can apply for the Back to School Clothing and Footwear
Allowance. You will be assessed using the standard rules and your total
household income must be less than the income limits.</p>

<h3>Back to work schemes</h3>

<p>There are some special conditions for people who are on <a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_and_work/back_to_work_enterprise_allowance.html">Back
to Work Enterprise Allowance</a>, <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/community_employment_scheme.html">Community
Employment</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../farming_and_fishing/rural_social_scheme.html">Rural Social
Scheme</a>,<a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/tus.html">Tús</a>
and the Community Services Programme. </p>

<p>If you were on a social welfare payment before going onto one of these
schemes, you will first be assessed using the standard means test for the Back
to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance.</p>

<p>If you fail to qualify using the standard means test, you will be
re-assessed to find out if you can retain the Allowance as a secondary benefit
under the different back to work schemes. In the re-assessment you can keep
your entitlement to the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (or
apply for it if you did not have an eligible child before now), as long as your
gross household income is less than €317.43.</p>

<p>In the re-assessment of means, the value of the Back to Work Enterprise
Allowance and Family Income Supplement is not taken into account in the
calculation of your gross household income. The people most likely to qualify
using the secondary benefit (€317.43) assessment are people getting a Back to
Work Enterprise Allowance. </p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The Back to Education Programme can support you to take part in educational
and personal development courses that will help you to access employment. There
are 3 different options under the Back to Education Programme:</p>
<ol><li>Back to Education Allowance (which includes the Second-Level Option, the
    Third-Level Option and the Post-Graduate Option)</li>
  <li>Part-Time Education Option</li>
  <li>Education, Training and Development Option</li>
</ol><h3>The Back to Education Allowance</h3>

<p>The Back to Education Allowance can support people getting a social welfare
payment to access second-level and third-level education and limited
post-graduate courses. The Back to Education Allowance is paid for the duration
of your course.</p>

<p>You must meet certain criteria to qualify for the <a shape="rect" href="back_to_education_allowance.html">Back to Education Allowance</a> and
from June 2014 all new BTEA claims must be recommended and approved by a DSP
Case Officer before you start the course. </p>

<h3>Part-Time Education Option</h3>

<p>If you are unemployed, the Part-Time Education Option allows you to keep
your Jobseeker's Allowance or Jobseeker's Benefit and attend a part-time day or
evening course that will improve your chances of getting a job (including <a href="../../../education/third_level_education/applying_to_college/third_level_places_for_unemployed_people.html">Springboard
courses</a>). You continue to get your jobseeker's payment at your usual rate.
You must also continue to be available for and actively seeking work. This
means you still need to <em>sign on</em> at your Social Welfare Local
Office.</p>

<p>There are no specific eligibility criteria for the <a shape="rect" href="part_time_education_option.html">Part-Time Education Option</a>. You can
be any age and may be unemployed for any length of time before starting a
part-time course of education.</p>

<h3>Education, Training and Development Option</h3>

<p>If you are getting Jobseeker's Allowance or Jobseeker's Benefit, the
Education, Training and Development Option allows you to keep your social
welfare payment and attend a course not covered by the standard Back to
Education Allowance such as a personal development course, a basic education
course (for example, literacy classes) a general training course or specific
job skills. You continue to get your jobseeker's payment at your usual rate.

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are unemployed, parenting alone or have a disability and are getting
certain payments from the Department of Social Protection, you may take part in
a second-or third-level education course and get a Back to Education Allowance
(BTEA). </p>

<p>If you want to do other types of courses not covered under the BTEA, for
example, personal development courses or general training courses you may
return to education under <a href="part_time_education_option.html">the
Part-time Education option</a>, the <a href="../../../education/returning_to_education/vocational_training_opportunities_scheme.html">Vocational
Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS)</a> or the <a href="education_training_and_development_option.html">Education, Training
and Development option</a>.</p>

<p>The Department of Social Protection has published <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/BTEA-Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx">Frequently
Asked Questions</a> about the scheme.</p>

<p>Since 2016/17, BTEA is only paid for courses that start in Ireland or in
Northern Ireland. You can be paid BTEA for a year abroad (for example, under
the Erasmus scheme) if the year is an integral or mandatory part of your
course. This must be verified by the Registrar or Admissions office of your
college. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l7dddc">Study options</h2>

<p>Two study options are available under the scheme:</p>
<ul><li>Second-level option </li>
  <li>Third-level option </li>
</ul><p>All courses must lead to a <a href="../../../education/third_level_education/colleges_and_qualifications/third_level_qualifications.html">Quality
and Qualifications Ireland (QQI)</a> accreditation (these include FETAC or
HETAC awards) or equivalent. You must also progress in educational
qualifications. For example, if you already have a Level 6 qualification on the
National Framework of Qualifications, the course you attend must be for at
least a Level 7 qualification. This progression rule has been relaxed for
people applying for second-level courses at Levels 5 and 6 in certain limited
circumstances. If you already hold a Level 5 or 6 qualification in an area that
is no longer growing (obtained at least 3 years ago) and you have worked for at
least 3 years and you satisfy all the other BTEA criteria, you may be allowed
to do further courses at either of these levels - provided the course is at
second level, will enable you to progress your career, lasts no more than 2
years (24 months) and meets future skills needs or local demand. Your DSP case
officer must also recommend the course if you are getting a jobseeker's
payment.</p>

<h3>Second-level option</h3>

<p>You can attend a second-level course of education at any secondary,
community, comprehensive or vocational school. The course must be full-time and
lead to a certificate recognised by the Department of Education and Skills or
approved by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), for example, <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/state_examinations/junior_certificate_programme.html">Junior
Certificate</a>, <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/state_examinations/established_leaving_certificate.html">Leaving
Certificate</a>, <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/vocational_education_and_training/training_and_apprentiship_programmes/post_leaving_certificate_courses.html">Post
Leaving Certificate</a> or a City and Guilds Certificate. An Access or
Foundation course is considered to be a second-level course for BTEA purposes.
</p>

<h3>Third-level option</h3>

<p>You can attend any third-level course of education in an approved third
level institution (university, institute of education or third level college).
The course must be a full-time day course and be approved for the <a href="../../../education/third_level_education/fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/maintenance_grant_schemes_for_students_on_third_level_courses.html">Student
Grant Scheme</a> or be approved by the Higher Education and Training Awards
Council (HETAC). Note that not all HETAC courses are approved for BTEA. </p>

<p><strong>Undergraduate courses</strong></p>

<p>In general you must be starting your third-level course at year one.
However, you may be eligible for BTEA if you:</p>
<ul><li>Are exempt from part of your course because of a qualification you
    received in a previous course. For example, you have a higher certificate
    in a course that you now wish to take to degree level. </li>
  <li>Completed a year (or years) of your course as a part-time student</li>
  <li>Completed earlier years before becoming unemployed or receiving statutory
    redundancy</li>
  <li>Are permitted by your school or college to proceed to the next year of a
    course having dropped out or deferred a year (due to mitigating
    circumstances) </li>
  <li>Were getting a One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) while in full-time
    education and were affected by age-related changes to OFP. People in this
    situation may be admitted to BTEA mid-course. </li>
</ul><p><strong>Postgraduate courses</strong></p>

<p>You can get the Back to Education Allowance for a postgraduate course of
study that leads to a Higher Diploma (H.Dip.) qualification in any discipline
or a Professional Masters in Education. </p>

<p>Other types of postgraduate qualifications are not recognised for BTEA. The
only exception to this is where a college has admitted a person without a
third-level qualification to a Master’s course on the basis of relevant life
experience - in these cases <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Back-to-Education-Allowance-Scheme.aspx#2.7">the
person may be entitled to BTEA</a>. </p>

<p>You will not get BTEA if you already have a postgraduate qualification. </p>

<h3>Student grants</h3>

<p><a href="/en/education/third_level_education/fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/maintenance_grant_schemes_for_students_on_third_level_courses.html">The
Student Grant Scheme</a> is divided into 2 components – maintenance grants
and fee grants. You cannot get the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) and the
maintenance component of a student grant together.</p>

<p>Although you are not entitled to the maintenance component of the student
grant, you must still submit a student grant application form to be assessed
for a fee grant to pay your Student Contribution (formerly called the student
services charge), field trip costs and tuition fees (if payable). </p>

<p>If you are getting a One-Parent Family Payment (or Jobseeker’s
Transitional payment) or a disability payment (Disability Allowance, Invalidity
Pension or Illness Benefit) you can choose to stay on your current social
welfare payment (if you continue to meet the rules of the scheme) and apply for
a student grant or you can choose to transfer to the BTEA, depending on which
option benefits you most. In general, people who are studying full-time are not
entitled to Rent Supplement unless they are getting BTEA. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="social_welfare_payments_and_the_student_maintenance_grant_for_the_2010_11_academic_year.html">Read
more in our document on social welfare payments and student grants.</a></p>

<p></p>

<h2>Qualifying for BTEA</h2>

<p>In general, to qualify for the BTEA you must be over 21, or over 24 for
postgraduate courses - see also 'Age limits' below - and have been getting a
qualifying social welfare payment. You must always have been accepted onto a
qualifying course.</p>

</ul><p></p>

<p>Since 2015, if you are a new BTEA applicant and you were getting a
jobseeker's payment, Farm Assist, a One-Parent Family Payment or a Jobseeker's
Transitional payment, you must re-establish your entitlement to a primary
payment to continue to be entitled to BTEA for the second or subsequent years
of study.</p>

<p>Since 1 January 2015 you no longer qualify for BTEA when your Jobseeker’s
Benefit ends – after 6 or 9 months. You must qualify for another payment to
continue to get BTEA. People who qualified for BTEA from Jobseeker’s Benefit
before 1 January 2015 can continue to get BTEA until the end of their course
and if they are progressing to a new approved course.</p>

<h3>Qualifying period</h3>

<p>For second level courses you must have been getting a qualifying social
welfare payment (see above) for at least <strong>3 months </strong>(78 paid or
credited days of unemployment).<strong></strong> You must be getting the
qualifying payment <strong>immediately</strong> before you start the course.
</p>

<p>For third level courses you must have been getting a qualifying social
welfare payment (see above) for <strong>9 months </strong>(234 paid or credited
days of unemployment)<strong></strong>. You must be getting the qualifying
payment <strong>immediately</strong> before you start the course. For the
Professional Masters in Education, you must have been getting a qualifying
social welfare payment for <strong>12 months </strong>(312 paid or credited
days of unemployment.</p>

<h4>Satisfying the qualifying period</h4>

<p>You do not have to have been getting your qualifying payment continuously.
Periods spent on other qualifying social welfare payments (or getting credits)
that are not broken by more than 12 months (52 weeks) can be used to determine
whether you satisfy the qualifying period criteria. You must always be getting
a qualifying payment <strong>immediately</strong> before starting your
course.</p>

<p>Time spent on the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA), Vocational Training
Opportunities Scheme (VTOS), full-time FET (formerly FÁS) training courses,
Community Employment schemes, Part-time Job Incentive scheme, Gateway,
Community Services Programme, Rural Social Scheme, TÚS, Workplace Placement
Scheme (WPP), Back to Work Enterprise Allowance, Short Term Enterprise
Allowance, Job Initiative, Job Assist and JobBridge may count towards the
qualifying period for BTEA purposes. This provision only applies where you have
established an entitlement to a qualifying social welfare payment
<strong>immediately</strong> before you start your course of study. </p>

<p>Time spent on Youthreach can count towards the qualifying period provided
you establish an entitlement to a qualifying social welfare payment before or
after completing the Youthreach programme.</p>

<p>Time spent in prison in the Irish State can count towards the qualifying
period provided you establish an entitlement to a qualifying social welfare
payment.</p>

<p>Time spent on Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) or on <a href="../../../moving_country/asylum_seekers_and_refugees/services_for_asylum_seekers_in_ireland/direct_provision.html">direct
provision</a> can count towards the qualifying period for BTEA. This applies
only if you establish an entitlement to a qualifying social welfare payment
immediately before you start your course of study and satisfy the linking rules
(see above). </p>

<p>If you have been awarded <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/overview_redundancy.html">statutory
redundancy</a> and are entitled to a qualifying social welfare payment
immediately before you start the course you can get immediate access to the
BTEA without any waiting period. You must take part in the BTEA scheme within
one year of getting statutory redundancy and satisfy all the other conditions.
</p>

<h3>Age limits</h3>

<p>To qualify for the Back to Education Allowance, you must be at least 21
years of age. You must be 24 for a third-level postgraduate course. </p>

<p>However, if you are getting <strong>Jobseeker's Allowance</strong>,
<strong>Jobseeker's Benefit</strong>, <a href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance_transition.html">Jobseeker's
Transitional payment</a> or <strong>One-Parent Family Payment</strong> for the
required period (3 months/78 days, 9 months/234 days or 12 months/312 days),
are aged between 18 and 20 and have been out of the formal education system for
at least 2 years you may qualify. </p>

<p>If you are <strong>aged 18 or over</strong> (over 24 for the postgraduate
option) and getting <strong>Blind Pension</strong>, <strong>Disability
Allowance</strong>, <strong>Invalidity Pension</strong> or <strong>Incapacity
Supplement</strong> for the required period (3 months/78 days or 9 months/234
days) you may qualify. </p>

<p><strong>Unemployment or illness credits</strong></p>

<p>If you are signing on for unemployment credits or submitting medical
certificates for illness credits, for the required period of time (either 3, 9,
12 months or 2 years depending on your course), you may qualify to participate
in the BTEA scheme on a non-payment basis. This means that you do not get a
weekly Back to Education Allowance. You continue to be awarded <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">credited
contributions</a> while you are taking part in the BTEA scheme. </p>

<p>If you are participating in the BTEA scheme on a non-payment basis, you can
also apply for a <a href="../../../education/third_level_education/fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/maintenance_grant_schemes_for_students_on_third_level_courses.html">student
grant</a> to be assessed for both the fee and maintenance component of the
grant.</p>

<h3>Other people who can qualify for BTEA</h3>

<p>Since 2 June 2015, <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">qualified
adults</a> must establish an entitlement to a qualifying payment in their own
right before they can be approved for BTEA. The rate payable is based on their
entitlement. You can use time spent as a qualified adult to satisfy the
qualifying period. </p>

<p>Before 2 June 2015, a qualified adult of a person who can claim BTEA could
qualify for BTEA in their own right.</p>

<p>Both partners can get BTEA while taking an approved course.</p>

<h3>Monitoring arrangements</h3>

<p>You must provide a certificate from the school/college confirming your
registration, commencement and attendance at the course. You must supply this
information before payment can begin. During the course of the academic year,
you may be asked to provide confirmation that you are still taking part in the
course. </p>

<p>If you change from a jobseeker's payment to BTEA, you do not need to <a shape="rect" href="../unemployed_people/signing_on.html">sign on</a> while you
are getting BTEA. </p>

<h3>BTEA and other payments</h3>

<p>People getting a Back Education Allowance cannot work full-time and are not
eligible for Community Employment, Social Economy Programme, Tús, Rural Social
Scheme, any other FET (formerly FÁS) or Fáilte Ireland training programmes,
Work Placement Programme, JobBridge, Part-time Job Incentive Scheme or any
other employment or training scheme or programme operated by the National
Learning Network. </p>

<p>People getting a Back to Education Allowance are not eligible for Family
Income Supplement (FIS).</p>

<h3>BTEA and part-time work </h3>

<p>Since the 2016/2017 academic year, people getting BTEA who take up work
during the academic year will be assessed under the rules (including means
assessment) that apply to their primary payment - the payment they qualified
for BTEA from. This only applies to new applicants or people who return to BTEA
after a break.</p>

<p>Previously, part-time work during the academic year did not affect the rate
of BTEA paid.</p>

<p>If you were getting a jobseeker’s payment before going back to education,
your BTEA is not paid over the summer months period between academic years. (It
will be paid from the start of the new academic year provided you continue to
satisfy the eligibility criteria.)</p>

<p>If you are not able to find work during the summer period, you may be
entitled to <a shape="rect" href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker's Benefit</a> or
<a shape="rect" href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
Allowance</a>. You must <a href="../unemployed_people/conditions_for_getting_a_jobseekers_payment.html">meet
all the conditions</a> including being capable of work, available for work and
genuinely looking for work. If you claim Jobseeker’s Allowance (JA) and work
part-time your earnings are assessed against your JA.</p>

<p>If you were getting a One-Parent Family Payment, <a href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance_transition.html">Jobseeker's
Transitional payment</a> or a disability payment before going back to
education, your BTEA will continue to be paid over the summer provided you are
returning to an approved course and are progressing in your education. If you
work over the summer your means from work are assessed using the rules that
apply to the original payment.</p>

<p>If you stop work or your work pattern changes you should inform your Intreo
centre so your case can be reassessed.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>If you are a new BTEA participant aged over 26, your weekly BTEA rate will
be equal to your previous social protection payment (the payment that qualified
you for participation in the scheme). You may also qualify for increases for a
qualified adult and qualified children. You must always have established an
entitlement to a qualifying payment immediately before starting BTEA, even if
you were previously on an employment or training scheme. The BTEA rate is based
on this qualifying payment. </p>

<p>If you are a new participant aged under 26 and you were getting a reduced
age-related Jobseeker's Allowance payment, you will get a new personal maximum
BTEA rate of €160 (increasing to €193 from September 2017). Any means you
have will be deducted from this rate. </p>

<p>You can get your Back to Education Allowance paid directly to your bank
account. It is paid for the duration of the course. If you were previously
getting a jobseeker's payment, you do not get the Back to Education Allowance
during the summer period between academic years. Your Intreo Centre will
contact you in March or April to ask the date of last attendance for the
current academic year and you will not be paid BTEA beyond this date. You may
get BTEA during the summer if you are on work placement or work experience that
is an essential part of your course.</p>

<p>If you defer a year of study you are treated as a new entrant when you
return to your course. </p>

<h3>Cost of Education Allowance</h3>

<p>From September 2017, you will get an annual Cost of Education Allowance of
€500 if you are getting BTEA and you have a dependent child.</p>

<h3><a></a>Keeping your extra benefits</h3>

<p>If you qualify for the Back to Education Allowance, you can keep your
entitlement to any extra benefits you already have, for example, <a shape="rect" href="../extra_social_welfare_benefits/fuel_allowance.html">Fuel
Allowance</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a>. However, any increase in income may affect your entitlement to
Rent Supplement or the amount of supplement you get. For example, this can
happen if you have additional income from part-time work. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>When you are accepted on a course, you should notify the Department of
Social Protection by filling in the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pdf/bte1.pdf">Back to Education Allowance
application form (pdf)</a>, which is also available from your Intreo Centre.
All new BTEA claims for jobseekers must be recommended by a DSP Case Officer
before a decision can be made on your BTEA entitlement. </p>

<p>You must get written confirmation that you are registered as a full-time day
student from the college registrar or admission officer. You will not get
payment of BTEA until you give this confirmation letter to the Department of
Social Protection. </p>

<p>You must apply for BTEA before your course starts (or within 30 days of the
course starting).</p>

<p>Send your application to the section in the Department of Social Protection
that deals with your payments – see ‘Where to apply’ below.</p>

<h4>Review and appeals</h4>

<p>The Back to Education Allowance is a non-statutory scheme. This means that
decisions cannot be appealed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. If you are
not satisfied with a decision you may request within 21 days (in writing) a
review by an officer of the relevant social welfare office or section,
enclosing any new evidence in support of the review.</p>

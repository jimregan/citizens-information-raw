<p>Under the Education, Training and Development Option you may continue to get
your <a shape="rect" href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s
Allowance</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker’s Benefit</a>
while attending certain short education, training or development. Your Intreo
centre may make special signing-on arrangements so that you can attend your
chosen course.</p>

<h3>Appeals </h3>

<p>The Education, Training and Development Option is an administrative scheme.
This means you cannot <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system_appeals.html">appeal a refusal</a> to
the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.socialwelfareappeals.ie/">Social Welfare
Appeals Office</a>. However you can seek a review of a decision. This will be
made by an officer of the Department of Social Protection not involved in the
decision being reviewed or by a more senior officer. The review will look at
whether the guidelines were applied correctly and that the correct processes
were followed. </p>

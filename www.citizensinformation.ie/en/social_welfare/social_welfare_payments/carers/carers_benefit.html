<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Carer's Benefit is a payment made to insured people who leave the workforce
to care for a person(s) in need of full-time care and attention. </p>

<p>You can get Carer's Benefit for a total period of 104 weeks for each person
being cared for. This may be claimed as a single continuous period or in any
number of separate periods up to a total of 104 weeks. However, if you claim
Carer's Benefit for less than six consecutive weeks in any given period you
must wait for a further six weeks before you can claim Carer's Benefit to care
for the same person again. </p>

<p>If you are caring for more than one person, you may receive payment for each
care recipient for 104 weeks. This may result in the care periods overlapping
or running concurrently.</p>

<h3>Respite care </h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../disability_and_illness/respite_care_grant.html">Carer's Support
Grant</a> is an annual payment made to carers by the Department of Social
Protection. It was formerly called the Respite Care Grant, but was renamed the
Carer's Support Grant to better reflect how it is used by carers. It is paid on
the first Thursday in June of each year. Find out more about <a shape="rect" href="../../../../health/health_services_for_people_with_disabilities/respite_care.html">respite
care</a>. </p>

<h3>Carer's leave </h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/carers_leave_from_employment.html">Your
right to carer's leave from employment</a> complements the Carer's Benefit
Scheme. Carer's leave allows you to leave your employment temporarily for up to
104 weeks to provide full-time care for people in need of full-time care and
attention. The leave is unpaid but people who take carer's leave <span>have
their jobs kept open for the duration of the leave</span>. You do not have to
be eligible for Carer's Benefit to get carer's leave. </p>

<p>If you think you have been wrongly refused Carer's Benefit, or you are
unhappy about a decision of a social welfare deciding officer about your
entitlements, you can <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system_appeals.html">appeal this
decision</a>.<br></p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You may be eligible for Carer's Benefit if:</p>
<ul><li>You are aged 16 or over and under 66. </li>
  <li>You have been employed for at least 8 weeks, whether consecutive or not,
    in the previous 26 week period. You must be in employment for a minimum of
    16 hours per week or 32 hours per fortnight. You don't have to meet this
    condition if you were getting Carer's Benefit in the previous 26 weeks.</li>
  <li>You give up work in order to be a full-time carer. Being a full-time
    carer means you must be living with or in a position to provide full-time
    care and attention to a person in need of care who is not living in an
    institution. </li>
  <li>You are not living in a hospital, convalescent home or other similar
    institution. However, you may continue to be regarded as providing
    full-time care and attention, if you or the person being cared for is
    having medical or other treatment in a hospital or other institution for a
    period not longer than 13 weeks. </li>
  <li>You meet the PRSI contribution conditions. </li>
  <li>The person being cared for is so incapacitated as to require full-time
    care and attention and is not normally living in an institution. Medical
    certification is required unless the person being cared for is a child who
    is getting <a shape="rect" href="../disability_and_illness/domiciliary_care_allowance.html">Domiciliary
    Care Allowance</a>. The carer of a child on a Domiciliary Care Allowance
    does not need to be the person who receives that allowance on the child's
    behalf. </li>
  <li>You must not take part in employment, self-employment, training or
    education courses outside the home for more than 15 hours a week. The
    maximum amount you can earn is €332.50 per week. (€332.50 is your net
    income after you have deducted income tax and Universal Social Charge,
    PRSI, superannuation (pension payments), pension levy, union dues,
    subscriptions to Friendly Societies and any health insurance contract
    premium from your total wage.) </li>
</ul><h3>PRSI contribution conditions</h3>

<p>You must have at least 156 contributions paid at any time between your entry
into insurance and the time you make your claim for Carer's Benefit and:</p>
<ul><li>39 contributions paid in the Relevant Tax Year or </li>
  <li>39 contributions paid in the 12-month period before the start of Carer's
    Benefit or </li>
  <li>26 contributions paid in the Relevant Tax Year and 26 contributions paid
    in the year before that. </li>
</ul><p>Only contributions at Class A, B, C, D, H and E can be counted towards
Carer's Benefit. Class S (self-employed contributions) do not count. The
Relevant Tax Year is the second last complete tax year before the year in which
you make your claim. So, for claims made in 2017, the Relevant Tax Year is
2015.</p>

<p>Periods of insurance in another EU member state may be taken into account to
meet the PRSI contribution conditions. The last week of insurance must be paid
in Ireland. </p>

<p>You are awarded <em></em><a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">credited
contributions</a> or <em>credits</em> automatically when you are getting
Carer's Benefit. Credits are awarded at the same rate as your last paid
contribution. These credits help protect your future entitlement to social
welfare benefits and pensions. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Claiming an increase for a child dependant</h3>

<p>You can claim an <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_and_increase_in_your_payment_for_a_child_dependant.html">increase
for a child</a> if they are under age 18, normally live with you and are
maintained by you. If a child is in full-time education by day at a recognised
school or college this increase is payable until the end of the academic year
in which the the child reaches age 22. (This child does not have to live at
home). A full-rate Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC) is payable if you are
single, widowed, separated or a civil partner who is not living with the other
civil partner. You may get a half-rate IQC if you are living with your spouse,
civil partner or cohabitant. If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is
getting a payment from the Department of Social Protection, you will each get a
half-rate increase. You cannot claim a half-rate IQC with your Carer's Benefit
if your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant has an income of over €400 a
week. </p>

<h3>Tax implications</h3>

<p>Carer's Benefit is a taxable source of income and should be advised to <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/contact/index.html">your local tax
office</a>.</p>

<h3>Continuing the payment after a death</h3>

<p>If the person you are caring for dies, payment of Carer's Benefit will
continue for 6 weeks following the death. </p>

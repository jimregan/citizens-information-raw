<p>If you are getting certain social welfare payments and you are providing
full-time care and attention to another person, you can keep your main social
welfare payment and get a half-rate Carer’s Allowance as well.</p>

<p>If you are in one of the following situations you may qualify for half-rate
Carer's Allowance:</p>
<ul><li><h4>Already getting Carer's Allowance but also meet the qualifying
    criteria for another social welfare payment </h4>
    <p>If you are getting Carer's Allowance and you also meet the qualifying
    conditions for another social welfare payment (for example, a State
    pension) you should apply for the other payment. If you qualify for the
    other payment you will be paid it in full and keep half your Carer’s
    Allowance payment as well. (For a list of social welfare payments paid with
    half-rate Carer's Allowance - see 'Rules' below)</p>
    <p>If you are currently getting Carer’s Allowance and your spouse, civil
    partner or cohabitant is claiming another social welfare payment (for
    example, Jobseeker’s Allowance), your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant
    may claim an increase in their social welfare payment for you as a
    qualified adult and your Carer’s Allowance will be reduced by 50%. This
    can only be done with your consent but it may increase your total household
    income.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Changed from another social welfare payment to get Carer's Allowance
    </h4>
    <p>If you were on another social welfare payment before claiming Carer's
    Allowance, you may get your original payment reinstated and also get
    half-rate Carer's Allowance, if you continue to meet the qualifying
    conditions for both schemes. (For a list of social welfare payments payable
    with half-rate Carer's Allowance - see 'Rules' below)</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Caring for someone and being claimed for by a spouse, civil partner
    or cohabitant </h4>
    <p>If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is claiming for you as a
    qualified adult on their payment and you are providing full-time care to
    another person, you can apply for half-rate Carer's Allowance and keep your
    current <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">Increase
    for a Qualified Adult</a> in full.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Getting a social welfare payment other than Carer's Allowance and
    caring for someone </h4>
    <p>If you are getting one of the social welfare payments payable with
    half-rate Carer's Allowance (see 'Rules' below) and caring for someone, you
    may keep your social welfare payment and qualify for half-rate Carer’s
    Allowance.</p>
  </li>
</ul><h3>People parenting alone</h3>

<p>People parenting alone, who meet the qualifying criteria for Carer's
Allowance, may qualify for both One-Parent Family Payment and half-rate
Carer’s Allowance (CA). If your youngest child is aged between 7 and 15
inclusive you must qualify for Carer's Allowance to continue to qualify for
OFP. You will also get an Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC) for any other
children in the family until they reach 18 (or 22 if in full-time education)
while CA and OFP is in payment. (See our document on <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent
Family Payment</a> for more information on other exceptions to the age
limits.)</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You must meet the qualifying criteria for Carer’s Allowance. For example,
the person you are caring for must be so incapacitated as to require full-time
care and attention and you must satisfy a means test. There is more information
in our document about <a shape="rect" href="carers_allowance.html">Carer’s
Allowance</a>. </p>

<p>If you satisfy the conditions for Carer’s Allowance it will be awarded at
50% of the rate that would apply if you were not getting any other payment. You
will also be eligible for the <a shape="rect" href="respite_care_grant.html">Carer's Support Grant</a> and a <a shape="rect" href="../extra_social_welfare_benefits/free_travel.html">Free Travel Pass</a>.
You may also be eligible for the <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/extra_social_welfare_benefits/household_benefits_package.html">Household
Benefits Package</a>.</p>

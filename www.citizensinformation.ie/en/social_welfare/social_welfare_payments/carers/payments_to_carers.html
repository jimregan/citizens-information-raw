<p>Carers may be entitled to a number of supports from the Department of Social
Protection. If you are caring for someone, a disabled child or adult or an
older person, you may qualify for a carer's payment. The two main social
welfare payments for carers providing full-time care are Carer's Allowance and
Carer's Benefit. You may also qualify for an annual Carer's Support Grant
(formerly known as a Respite Care Grant). </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="carers_benefit.html">Carer's Benefit</a> is a
short-term payment paid for up to 24 months to people who give up employment to
care on a full-time basis for someone who requires full-time care and
attention. After one year's service employees may take unpaid <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/carers_leave_from_employment.html">Carer's
Leave</a> of up to 2 years to provide full-time care for someone who needs it.
Carer's Benefit may be paid during this time. Additional payments are made if
you are looking after more than one person. If you do not qualify for Carer's
Benefit you may qualify for Carer's Allowance. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="carers_allowance.html">Carer's Allowance</a> is a
payment for people who are caring on a full-time basis for someone who requires
full-time care and attention and will require it for at least 12 months. You
must satisfy a means test and the habitual residency condition. <a href="half_rate_carers_allowance.html">A half-rate Carer's Allowance</a> is
payable with certain other social welfare payments, this means that you can
keep your main social welfare payment and get half-rate Carer's Allowance as
well. If you get Carer's Allowance you are entitled to a <a shape="rect" href="../extra_social_welfare_benefits/free_travel.html">Free Travel
Pass</a>.</p>

<p>If the person you are caring for is under 16 you must be gettting
Domiciliary Care Allowance to qualify for Carer's Allowance.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../disability_and_illness/domiciliary_care_allowance.html">Domiciliary
Care Allowance</a> is a monthly payment made to the carer of a child with a
severe disability who lives at home. When your child reaches 16 years of age he
or she may qualify for Disability Allowance. If you continue to provide
full-time care and attention for your child you can retain your carer's
payment. </p>

<p>If you are caring for a dependant child you may be entitled to an <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it18.pdf">Incapacitated Child
Tax Credit</a>. If you are employing a carer, you may be entitled to claim a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it47.pdf">tax
allowance for employing a carer for a disabled person</a>.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="respite_care_grant.html">The Car</a><a shape="rect" href="respite_care_grant.html">er's Support Grant</a> is an annual payment made
to carers, aged 16 or over, providing full-time care for at least six months a
year. However, this period must include the first Thursday in June. You are
allowed to work for a certain number of hours each week. A Carer's Support
Grant is paid for each person being cared for. If you are getting Carer's
Allowance, Carer's Benefit or Domiciliary Care Allowance you do not need to
apply for the grant, it is automatically paid to you in June. <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/health_services_for_people_with_disabilities/respite_care.html">Respite
care</a> can allow any carer to take a break from caring. </p>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/homemakers_scheme.html">Homemaker's
Scheme</a>, if you give up work to care full-time for a child under 12 or a
disabled child or adult, you may be able to have these years disregarded or not
taken into account when your yearly average is calculated for your State
Pension (Contributory).</p>

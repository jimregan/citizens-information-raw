<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you lose your job, are made redundant, laid off or if your working hours
are reduced you may qualify for a social welfare payment, either Jobseeker’s
Allowance or Jobseeker’s Benefit. When you apply for a jobseeker’s payment
you declare that you are available for work, fit for work, genuinely seeking
work but unable to find work. This is also known as <em>signing on</em>.</p>

<p><strong>If you work for part of a week</strong>, you may qualify for a
jobseeker's payment for the days you are unemployed. </p>

<p><strong>If you leave work voluntarily or as a result of misconduct</strong>,
you cannot get a jobseeker’s payment for 9 weeks. However, if you have
‘good cause’ to leave voluntarily, for example, any changes in working
conditions such as a reduction in pay, harassment or abuse from your employer,
you may get your payment. The Deciding Officer in your local Intreo Centre or
Social Welfare Branch Office will decide whether you had good cause to leave
voluntarily.</p>

<p><strong>If you are self-employed</strong> you may get a jobseeker’s
payment if you closed your business or the amount of work you are getting has
sufficiently reduced. Find out more about <a shape="rect" href="self_employed_and_unemployment.html">self-employed people and
unemployment</a>.</p>

<h3>The difference between Jobseeker’s Benefit and Jobseeker’s Allowance
</h3>

<p>To get <a shape="rect" href="jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker’s
Benefit</a> you must have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.
Jobseeker's Benefit rates are graduated according to earnings. If you are
affected by this, it may be of greater benefit for you to claim Jobseeker's
Allowance.</p>

<p>To get <a shape="rect" href="jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s
Allowance</a> you must pass a means test. A means test is when your income is
calculated to see whether it falls below a certain level. If it falls below a
certain level you can get Jobseeker’s Allowance.</p>

<p>You will always be assessed for Jobseeker’s Benefit first, unless you have
never worked before. When you apply for Jobseeker’s Benefit you are asked if
you want to be assessed for Jobseeker’s Allowance. This means that if you
don’t qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit, you will not need to apply a second
time to be assessed for Jobseeker’s Allowance. </p>

<h2>Intreo - the integrated employment andsupport service </h2>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="la63d8">Signing on for the first time</h2>

<p>To sign on you must go to your local Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch
Office.</p>
<ol><li>If you are visiting an Intreo centre you should go to the reception area.
    You will be met by DSP staff who will check your eligibility for a
    jobseeker’s payment. They will arrange an appointment for you to have
    your claim processed (within a few days), give you the application form and
    tell you what documents you need to bring to your appointment. 
    <p><a href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/secure/eforms.aspx">You can
    submit your application for a jobseeker’s payment online in certain
    locations</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>You should bring your completed application form and all other required
    documents to your appointment. At your appointment, a DSP Deciding Officer
    will review and process your application. In many cases a decision on your
    jobseeker’s payment can be made immediately. You will be asked to sign a
    <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/record%20of%20mutual%20commitments.pdf">Record
    of Mutual Commitments (pdf)</a> which explains your rights and
    responsibilities while you are getting a jobseeker’s payment. 
    <p>Under the Record of Mutual Commitments you are expected to:</p>
    <ul><li>Co-operate with the Intreo service in developing a Personal
        Progression Plan</li>
      <li>Use this plan to do your best to secure employment</li>
      <li>Attend all meetings requested by the Department</li>
      <li>Provide all information requested by the Department </li>
    </ul></li>
  You will be issued with a Public Services card (this involves having your
  photo taken and your signature digitally captured). All jobseekers have to
  register for a Public Services card if they have not been issued with one
  already. 
  <li>You will also be given details of a group information session that you
    must attend. At this information session, you will be told about the full
    range of support services available from Intreo, including income,
    training/education and employment supports. </li>
  <li>Depending on your personal profile, you may be given an appointment for a
    further meeting with a DSP case officer. At this meeting your case officer
    will discuss your options with you and agree your Personal Progression Plan
    to prepare you to find employment. You will get ongoing advice and support
    to help you meet the goals in your Personal Progression Plan.</li>
</ol><p>If you do not keep to the steps agreed in the Record of Mutual Commitments
and the conditions of your jobseeker’s payment, your payment can be reduced
and eventually stopped altogether.</p>

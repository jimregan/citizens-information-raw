<p>There are some special administrative provisions in place for older
jobseekers. These provisions aim to help people during the transition from the
labour force into retirement. These provisions recognise that older jobseekers
may have more difficulty re-training and re-entering the workplace if they lose
their job when they are near to retirement age. Older people in some cases have
to retire at 65 but they may not qualify for a <a href="../older_and_retired_people/income_supports_for_older_people.html">State
pension</a> until they are 66.</p>

retirement</a>.</p>

<h2>Jobseeker’s Benefit for people over 65</h2>

<p>People over 65 who are claiming Jobseeker’s Benefit (JB), and who have at
least 156 PRSI contributions, can continue to receive JB until their 66th
birthday even if their claim is due to end before that date. This special
provision extends the duration of JB for people aged 65 and over and aims to
support the transition of older workers from the labour force into
retirement.</p>

<h2>Other arrangements for older jobseekers</h2>

<p>From 1 January 2014, if you are claiming Jobseeker’s Benefit or Allowance
and are aged 62 or over, the following applies:</p>
<ul><li>You will no longer be required to engage with the compulsory activation
    process (see below) and you will not be subject to penalty rates for
    non-engagement</li>
  <li>You can voluntarily avail of a range of supports (for example, training
    or employment support programmes) from the Department of Social
  Protection</li>
  <li>However, when you turn 62, if you are <strong>already engaged</strong> in
    activation (selected and referred for engagement) or if you are
    <strong>currently taking part</strong> in an activation programme (such as
    Community Employment, JobPath or training courses), you are expected to
    complete the programme. If you leave activation programmes before
    completion your jobseeker payment may be reduced. </li>
</ul><table border="1" style="width: 100%"><caption></caption>
  <col><tbody><tr><td><strong>What is activation?</strong> 

        <p>Labour market activation policies are designed to give jobseekers a
        better chance of finding employment. The Department of Social
        Protection describes activation as its engagement with jobseekers to
        support them back into employment. Jobseekers are expected to fully
        engage with this process and use the supports offered during the
        activation process which might include education or training schemes,
        employment support schemes to help them back into the workplace,
        internships and other supports.</p>

        <p>People aged under 62 who do not engage with the activation process
        may have their payment reduced and can subsequently be disqualified
        from their payment for up to 9 weeks.</p>

<p>In addition, most jobseekers aged 62 or over will be placed on a yearly
signing arrangement with their Intreo Centre or local Social Welfare Branch
Office (this means that they do not need to sign on regularly) and most will be
transferred to Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) payments so payment can be made
directly into their bank account. Certain categories of older jobseekers may be
required to engage more frequently with their Intreo Centre or local Social
Welfare Branch Office. For example, casual jobseekers of 62 and older must
continue to submit weekly dockets of their work patterns.</p>

<p>Note that to qualify for either Jobseeker’s Benefit or Allowance you must
be genuinely seeking work and be available for full-time employment and these
conditions continue to apply to all jobseekers.</p>

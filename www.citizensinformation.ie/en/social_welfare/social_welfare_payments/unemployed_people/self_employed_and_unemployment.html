<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Self-employed people can become unemployed if their business has to close
down. It may also be the case, though you continue to be self-employed the
amount of work you are getting has reduced so much that it no longer provides
you with a sufficient income.</p>

<p>If you find yourself unemployed or you are getting less work than before you
may qualify for a jobseeker's payment. You do <strong>not</strong> need to
de-register as self-employed to get a payment. However you must meet <a href="conditions_for_getting_a_jobseekers_payment.html">the conditions that
apply to jobseeker's payments</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not qualify for a social welfare payment you may be eligible to
pay <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/voluntarysocialinsurancecontributions.html" shape="rect">voluntary contributions</a>. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="le3f91">Jobseeker's Benefit</h2>

<p>Self-employed people pay <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/class_S_prsi.html">Class
S PRSI</a>. Class S PRSI only covers you for certain social welfare payments.
It does <strong>not </strong>cover you for Jobseeker’s Benefit. </p>

<p>However, if you worked as an employee in the last 4 years, you may have paid
Class A PRSI and should apply to your local Intreo Centre or social welfare
local office for <a shape="rect" href="jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker’s
Benefit</a>. Your Intreo centre or social welfare local office will check their
records to find out whether you have enough Class A contributions to get
Jobseeker’s Benefit. </p>

<p>If you work part-time you may qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit. However,
you must have lost at least one day of employment and as a result of this loss
be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 days. Your earnings must also have
been reduced because of the loss of employment. For example, if you are engaged
under a contract for service to work (on a self-employed basis) for 3 days per
week and unemployed for the remainder of the week, you may qualify for
Jobseeker’s Benefit. <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">Jobseeker’s
Benefit is taxable</a>. </p>

<p>If you do <strong>not</strong> qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit you may get
Jobseeker’s Allowance. When you apply for Jobseeker’s Benefit you will be
asked if you want to be assessed for Jobseeker’s Allowance if your claim for
Jobseeker’s Benefit is unsuccessful.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l260fc">Jobseeker's Allowance</h2>

<p>To get Jobseeker’s Allowance you must be <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitually
resident</a> and pass a <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/means_test_for_jobseekers_allowance.html">means
test</a>. If you are self-employed, you may be entitled to Jobseeker's
Allowance depending on your earnings from your business. You do not need to
close your business or stop working as self-employed for you to get
Jobseeker’s Allowance. You will get Jobseeker’s Allowance if your income is
below a certain level.</p>

<p><strong>Income from self-employment and the means test</strong><br>
The earnings from your business will be assessed in the means test for
Jobseeker’s Allowance. The assessment must reflect the income you may
reasonably be expected to get from your business over the next 12 months.
Income for the last 12 months will be taken as a guide but allowing for any
factors which it is known will vary. You should be prepared to discuss these
factors when you are assessed for Jobseeker’s Allowance.</p>

<p>Earnings are assessed as gross income less work related expenses over 12
months. Your expected annual earnings from self-employment is divided by 52 to
find your weekly means from self-employment. Any ‘drawings’ you take from
the business is not an allowable expense. If your ‘drawings’ from the
business are greater than the level of income calculated, the ‘drawings’
are assessed as cash income. There is no exhaustive list of all business
expenses allowed because expenses vary with the nature and extent of the
self-employment. However the following are the main allowable expenses in most
cases:</p>
<ul><li>Materials (supplies costs) </li>
  <li>Motor running costs (portion applicable to business) </li>
  <li>Depreciation of machinery or equipment </li>
  <li>Insurance relating to the business </li>
  <li>Telephone (portion applicable to business) </li>
  <li>Lighting and heating (for business and not domestic use) </li>
  <li>Advertising </li>
  <li>Bank charges </li>
  <li>Stationery </li>
  <li>Van leasing </li>
  <li>Any other costs associated with running the business (household running
    costs are not allowed as deductions against business profit)</li>
</ul><p>To prove the level of income from your business you must give your receipts
and payments (documentation showing money coming in and out of your business)
or audited accounts to the person dealing with your application in your Intreo
centre or social welfare local office. </p>

<p><strong>When you apply for Jobseeker’s Allowance</strong><br>
Usually, you will be asked for your receipts and payments or audited accounts
for the current and previous year. For example, if you apply for Jobseeker's
Allowance in April 2017 you will be asked for your receipts and payments from
January to April 2017 and for 2016. However, in certain cases you may be
required to show audited accounts for the last two or more years. Find out more
about <a shape="rect" href="signing_on.html">signing on for a jobseeker’s
payment</a>.</p>

<p>You may qualify for Supplementary Welfare Allowance while you are waiting to
be assessed for a jobseeker’s payment or if you don’t qualify for a
jobseeker’s payment.<br></p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l794df">Supplementary Welfare Allowance</h2>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary
Welfare Allowance</a> provides a basic weekly allowance to eligible people who
have little or no income. If your weekly income is below the Supplementary
Welfare Allowance rate for your family size, a payment may be made to bring
your income up to the appropriate Supplementary Welfare Allowance rate. </p>

<p>You cannot get Supplementary Welfare Allowance if you are working more than
30 hours per week. If you have claimed a jobseeker’s payment but it has not
yet been paid and you have no other income, you may qualify for Supplementary
Welfare Allowance while you are awaiting payment.</p>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="lc4121">Other benefits</h2>

<p>If your income is below a certain amount you may get a <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical
card</a> or a <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/gp_visit_cards.html">GP visit
card</a>.</p>

<p>You may get <a shape="rect" href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">help with paying
your rent</a>. If you are in local authority housing you should contact your
local authority and ask for a review of your rent because of the reduction in
your income.</p>

<p>You may get help with the cost of uniforms and footwear for children
attending school. The <a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/back_to_school_clothing_and_footwear_allowance.html">Back
to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance Scheme</a> operates from 1 June to 30
September each year.</p>

<p>If you have an exceptional or urgent need, for example, you need help with a
funeral bill, a range of <a shape="rect" href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/exceptional_needs_payments.html">discretionary
payments are provided by the Department of Social Protection's representative
(formerly known as the Community Welfare Officer)</a> in your <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/ContactUs/Pages/cwo_contact.aspx">local health
centre</a>.</p>

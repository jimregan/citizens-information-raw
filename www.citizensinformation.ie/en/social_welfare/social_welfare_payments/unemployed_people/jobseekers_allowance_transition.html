<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Jobseeker’s Transitional payment is a special arrangement under the <a href="jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s Allowance</a> scheme that
aims to support lone parents into the workforce while they have young children.
The payment is known as JST.</p>

<p>This payment is available to people who are not cohabiting and whose
youngest child is aged between 7 and 13 years inclusive.</p>

<p>If you were getting JST and stopped for some reason (for example because you
found work or started to cohabit), you can requalify if you still satisfy the
conditions of the scheme.</p>

<p>If you are no longer entitled to OFP, and your youngest child is aged 14
years or over, you can apply for the normal Jobseeker’s Allowance.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The rules that apply to Jobseeker’s Allowance (JA) and JST are similar.
The maximum weekly rate of payment is the same. The main differences between JA
and JST are:</p>
<ul><li>You do not have to be available for and genuinely seeking full-time work.
    This is to allow you to meet your caring responsibilities when you have
    young children. There are <a href="../social_welfare_payments_and_work/afterschool_childcare_scheme.html">childcare
    supports</a> available if you do find work.</li>
  <li>You can take part in a course of education and get JST (and, if eligible,
    a student maintenance grant). However, you should find our whether or not
    the <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">Back
    to Education Allowance</a> is a better option for you in our document on <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/back_to_education/social_welfare_payments_and_the_student_maintenance_grant_for_the_2010_11_academic_year.html">social
    welfare payments and the student grant</a>.</li>
  <li>You do not have to be fully unemployed for 4 out of 7 days. This means
    that you could work part-time for 5 days and still receive a payment
    (subject to the means test). This would allow you to work mornings only
    while your children are in school. </li>
  <li>You cannot cohabit with another person while you are getting JST.</li>
</ul><p>While you are getting JST you must sign a quarterly declaration to confirm
that you are still entitled to JST. You must always declare any change in your
circumstances including a change in your living arrangement or means that might
affect your entitlement to JST. </p>

<h3>Conditions for getting JST</h3>

<p>You must satisfy the Jobseeker's Allowance means test. Income from work is
assessed differently for JST (see below). </p>

<p>To be eligible for JST you must be <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitually
resident in Ireland</a>, you must not be cohabiting and you must be capable of
work. When your youngest child reaches 14 years of age, the normal <a href="conditions_for_getting_a_jobseekers_payment.html">Jobseeker Allowance
conditions</a> will apply to you.</p>

<p>When you start getting a Jobseeker's Transitional payment you will be
scheduled to attend a meeting with one of the Department of Social Protection's
Case Officers. The purpose of this meeting is to identify and access supports
(such as education, training and employment schemes) that will prepare you for
full-time employment. If you do not participate in this process, you may be
paid a reduced rate of JST (a penalty rate) or you may be disqualified from
getting your JST payment.</p>

<h3>Work and JST</h3>

<p>You can work and get JST. The amount of payment you get depends on your
weekly means. </p>

<p>From January 2017, the first €110 of your gross weekly earnings is
disregarded (or not taken into account). 50% of the balance is assessed as
means.</p>

<p>If you are self-employed, this income disregard does not apply. Instead,
your net profit (gross profit less expenses) is assessed as means.</p>

<p><a href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
Income Supplement</a> is not payable with JST. </p>

<h3>Carers</h3>

<p>You cannot claim a half-rate Carer’s Allowance with JST. If you are
parenting alone and qualify for a carer’s payment you continue to be eligible
for a One-Parent Family Payment until your youngest child is 16. This means
that you can claim OFP and a half-rate Carer’s Allowance together if you
qualify for both payments. </p>

<h2>Extra benefits</h2>

<p>If you are getting JST you may qualify for <a href="../extra_social_welfare_benefits/fuel_allowance.html">Fuel
Allowance</a> (whether you have been getting OFP previously or not). You can
claim a <a href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/back_to_school_clothing_and_footwear_allowance.html">Back
To School Clothing and Footwear Allowance</a> and <a href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a>. You cannot claim Rent Supplement if you are getting a student
maintenance grant or if you are in full-time education. </p>

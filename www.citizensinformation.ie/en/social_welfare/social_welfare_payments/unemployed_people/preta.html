<p>The Pre-Retirement Allowance (PRETA) is for people in Ireland aged 55 and
over who have left the labour force. It is means-tested and you no longer have
to sign-on as you do not need to be available for work. </p>

<p><strong>Since 4 July 2007, no new applications for Pre-Retirement Allowance
are accepted</strong>. However, if you were getting Pre-Retirement Allowance
before 4 July 2007 you are not affected and can continue to get it.</p>

<p>(The means test is similar to the means test for <a shape="rect" href="jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's Allowance</a>).</p>

<h3>Working while on Pre-Retirement Allowance</h3>

<p>You cannot work and get PRETA. </p>

<p>However, there are exceptions, if you are getting PRETA for 12 months or
longer you are eligible for either the <a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_and_work/back_to_work_allow.html">Back to Work
Allowance</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_and_work/back_to_work_enterprise_allowance.html">Back
to Work Enterprise Allowance</a> scheme. Smallholders (farmers) may earn money
from their holding and get PRETA, provided they pass the means test.</p>

<p>You do <strong>not</strong> have to sign on if you are getting PRETA.</p>

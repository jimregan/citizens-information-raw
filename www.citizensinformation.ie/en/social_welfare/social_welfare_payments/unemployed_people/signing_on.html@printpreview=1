<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you lose your job, are made redundant, laid off or if your working hours
are reduced you may qualify for a social welfare payment, either Jobseeker’s
Allowance or Jobseeker’s Benefit. When you apply for a jobseeker’s payment
you declare that you are available for work, fit for work, genuinely seeking
work but unable to find work. This is also known as <em>signing on</em>.</p>

<p><strong>If you work for part of a week</strong>, you may qualify for a
jobseeker's payment for the days you are unemployed. </p>

<p><strong>If you leave work voluntarily or as a result of misconduct</strong>,
you cannot get a jobseeker’s payment for 9 weeks. However, if you have
‘good cause’ to leave voluntarily, for example, any changes in working
conditions such as a reduction in pay, harassment or abuse from your employer,
you may get your payment. The Deciding Officer in your social welfare local
office or Intreo centre will decide whether you had good cause to leave
voluntarily.</p>

<p><strong>If you are self-employed</strong> you may get a jobseeker’s
payment if you closed your business or the amount of work you are getting has
sufficiently reduced. Find out more about <a shape="rect" href="self_employed_and_unemployment.html">self-employed people and
unemployment</a>.</p>

<h3>The difference between Jobseeker’s Benefit and Jobseeker’s Allowance
</h3>

<p>To get <a shape="rect" href="jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker’s
Benefit</a> you must have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.
Jobseeker's Benefit rates are graduated according to earnings. If you are
affected by this, it may be of greater benefit for you to claim Jobseeker's
Allowance.</p>

<p>To get <a shape="rect" href="jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s
Allowance</a> you must pass a means test. A means test is when your income is
calculated to see whether it falls below a certain level. If it falls below a
certain level you can get Jobseeker’s Allowance.</p>

<p>You will always be assessed for Jobseeker’s Benefit first, unless you have
never worked before. When you apply for Jobseeker’s Benefit you are asked if
you want to be assessed for Jobseeker’s Allowance. This means that if you
don’t qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit, you will not need to apply a second
time to be assessed for Jobseeker’s Allowance. </p>

<h2>Intreo - the integrated employment andsupport service </h2>

<p>Many Department of Social Protection (DSP) social welfare local offices and
employment services offices have been rebranded as Intreo centres. <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Intreo/Pages/Index.aspx">Intreo</a> provides a
one-stop shop for employment services and income supports with a range of
personalised supports to jobseekers including:</p>
<ul><li>Information on all the income supports provided by the Department of
    Social Protection, for example, jobseeker’s payments, back to work and
    back to education payments, one-parent family payments and pensions</li>
  <li><a href="employment_supports.html">Help and advice on employment,
    training and personal development opportunities</a></li>
  <li>Personalised support to help you enter the workforce</li>
  <li>Self-service facilities with information and guidance on employment and
    training opportunities</li>
  <li>Information on job vacancies through <a href="http://www.jobsireland.ie/">jobsireland.ie</a></li>
</ul><p>Intreo will be available in all offices by the end of 2014. Details of new
locations are published on <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/ContactUs/Pages/Intreo_Contact.aspx">welfare.ie</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="la63d8">Signing on for the first time</h2>

<p>To sign on you must go to your social welfare local office or Intreo
centre.</p>
<ol><li>If you are visiting an Intreo centre you should go to the reception area.
    You will be met by DSP staff who will check your eligibility for a
    jobseeker’s payment. They will arrange an appointment for you to have
    your claim processed (within a few days), give you the application form and
    tell you what documents you need to bring to your appointment. 
    <p><a href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/secure/eforms.aspx">You can
    submit your application for a jobseeker’s payment online in certain
    locations</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>You should bring your completed application form and all other required
    documents to your appointment. At your appointment, a DSP Deciding Officer
    will review and process your application. In many cases a decision on your
    jobseeker’s payment can be made immediately. You will be asked to sign a
    <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/record%20of%20mutual%20commitments.pdf">Record
    of Mutual Commitments (pdf)</a> which explains your rights and
    responsibilities while you are getting a jobseeker’s payment. 
    <p>Under the Record of Mutual Commitments you are expected to:</p>
    <ul><li>Co-operate with the Intreo service in developing a Personal
        Progression Plan</li>
      <li>Use this plan to do your best to secure employment</li>
      <li>Attend all meetings requested by the Department</li>
      <li>Provide all information requested by the Department </li>
    </ul></li>
  You will be issued with a Public Services card (this involves having your
  photo taken and your signature digitally captured). All jobseekers have to
  register for a Public Services card if they have not been issued with one
  already. 
  <li>You will also be given details of a group information session that you
    must attend. At this information session, you will be told about the full
    range of support services available from Intreo, including income,
    training/education and employment supports. </li>
  <li>Depending on your personal profile, you may be given an appointment for a
    further meeting with a DSP case officer. At this meeting your case officer
    will discuss your options with you and agree your Personal Progression Plan
    to prepare you to find employment. You will get ongoing advice and support
    to help you meet the goals in your Personal Progression Plan.</li>
</ol><p>If you do not keep to the steps agreed in the Record of Mutual Commitments
and the conditions of your jobseeker’s payment, your payment can be reduced
and eventually stopped altogether.</p>

<h3>Checklists</h3>

<p>When you apply for Jobseeker’s Benefit or Jobseeker’s Allowance you must
bring the correct documents with you. Use our checklists to make sure you have
the right documents.</p>

</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lfe3ef">Getting paid</h2>

<p>Your jobseeker’s payment is paid weekly by the Department of Social
Protection. </p>

<p>You can collect your jobseeker’s payment weekly from your nearest post
office. You must bring valid photographic identification (photo ID) or your <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/public_services_card.html">Public
Services Card</a> with you to collect your payment. Valid photo ID includes a
driving licence, a passport or a GNIB card. </p>
</div>

<h2>Signing on every month </h2>

<p>You must go to your Intreo centre or social welfare local office, usually
every month, and declare you are still unemployed and looking for work. You
will be given a date and a time to sign on each month.</p>

<p>In some cases you may sign on more or less frequently. Usually if you live
<strong>up to</strong> 10 miles from the nearest social welfare local office
you will sign on every 4 weeks. If you live <strong>over</strong> 10 miles from
the nearest social welfare local office you will sign on every 12 weeks. People
over 62 may not need to sign on every month. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lc4121">Other benefits</h2>

<p>Supplementary Welfare Allowance provides a basic weekly allowance to
eligible people who have little or no income. If your weekly income is below
the Supplementary Welfare Allowance rate for your family size, a payment may be
made to bring your income up to the appropriate Supplementary Welfare Allowance
rate. </p>

<p>If you have claimed any social welfare payment, but it has not been paid and
you have no other income, you may qualify for <a shape="rect" href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">Supplementary
Welfare Allowance</a> while you are waiting for your payment.</p>

<p>If you get Jobseeker’s Allowance or Jobseeker’s Benefit or Supplementary
Welfare Allowance you may be entitled to other social welfare and health
benefits. </p>

<p>If your income is below a certain amount you may get a <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical
card</a> or a <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/entitlement_to_health_services/gp_visit_cards.html">GP visit
card</a>.</p>

<p>You may get <a shape="rect" href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">help with paying
your rent</a>. If you are in local authority housing you should contact your
local authority and ask for a review of your rent.</p>

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Young people must meet the same <a href="conditions_for_getting_a_jobseekers_payment.html">conditions as other
jobseekers</a> to get a jobseeker's payment but they may need targeted supports
to help them enter the workforce. A Youth Guarantee is being introduced (see
below) that will support all young jobseekers and give them access to training,
education, work experience or full-time employment.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l260fc">Jobseeker's Allowance</h2>

<p>If you have just left school you cannot get <a href="jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's Allowance</a>. To get
Jobseeker's Allowance you must have been out of school for 3 months and you
must be at least 18 years of age. The 3-month period starts from the day you
leave school or the day following your last exam if you are doing exams. </p>

<p>People aged under 26 who do not have children get a reduced rate of
Jobseeker's Allowance. If they take up a place on an education, training or
work experience scheme they will get a higher rate of payment. You can visit
our documents on <a href="../../../education/vocational_education_and_training/courses_for_long_term_unemployed_people.html">education
and training options</a> and on <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/schemes_to_support_employment.html">employment
support schemes</a> to get more information on the rates paid. </p>

<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" border="1" width="600" summary="Jobseeker's Allowance maximum rate for people under 26 years of age"><caption><strong>Maximum rate of JA for people under 26 without

<p>The reduced personal and qualified adult rates of Jobseeker’s Allowance
(JA) for people under 26 do not apply to:</p>
<ul><li>People with dependent children</li>
  <li>People transferring from Disability Allowance to JA</li>
  <li>People aged 22-25 who were getting a higher rate before 15 January
  2014</li>
  <li>People whose claim is linked to a previous JA claim made within the
    previous 12 months to which the maximum personal rate applied</li>
  <li>Certain children who were in the care of the HSE during the 12 months
    before reaching 18. These people are assessed using the JA rate for people
    aged 26 or over. This exception only applies between the ages of 18 and 24.
    From the age of 25, the age-related rate applies.</li>
</ul><p>If you were getting an age-related reduced rate of JA and you take part in a
course of education or training or an employment scheme the reduced personal
rate of payment applicable to that course or scheme will apply as long as you
are aged under 26. When you complete the course you will revert to your
previous age-related JA rate.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="le3f91">Jobseeker's Benefit</h2>

<p>You must have at least 104 social insurance contributions (2 years) to
qualify for <a href="jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker’s Benefit
(JB)</a>. This means that many young people do not qualify for Jobseeker’s
Benefit if they lose their job or cannot find employment. If you worked
part-time during school or college you may have enough PRSI contributions to
qualify for JB but if your average weekly earnings were below €300 you may
only qualify for a lower rate of JB.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="laba06">Students</h2>

<p>Third-level students cannot claim Jobseeker's Allowance or Benefit while
they are studying full-time. This disqualification also applies to the summer
holiday periods between academic years (unless you are a mature student or are
getting a Back To Education Allowance). However once you have finished college
permanently you can claim a jobseeker's payment if you cannot find work. This
is also the case if you leave college without finishing your course. You may be
able to claim a jobseeker’s payment while you are working on a project or
research thesis if you are available for work during this time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Can-I-qualify-for-student-credits.aspx">Student
credits</a> may help you to qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit. They are awarded
where you were a full-time student during the relevant tax year and had paid
contributions before going to college or during the period spent at college.
You must have paid contributions at Class A, have started full-time education
before 23 years of age and have re-entered insurable employment after the
course has ceased. Student credits can only be awarded only once.</p>

<h2>Back to Education Allowance</h2>

<p>From 1 January 2014 all new <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">Back
to Education Allowance (BTEA)</a> participants aged under 26 who were getting a
reduced age-related Jobseeker’s Allowance payment, will get a maximum BTEA
rate of €160 per week (any means participants have will be deducted from this
rate). If you have been getting the Back to Education Allowance during your
second-level studies you can claim JA immediately.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l59abb">The Youth Guarantee</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Youth-Guarantee-Ireland.aspx">Youth
Guarantee</a> aims to provide young people under the age of 25 with a good
quality offer of employment, education, training or apprenticeship within a
short time of leaving education or becoming unemployed. It is an EU initiative
developed in response to the youth unemployment crisis. Across the EU, an
estimated 7.5 million young people aged 15-24 are not employed, not in
education and not in training.</p>

<p>In Ireland, the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/Youth-Guarantee-Implementation-Plan.pdf">Guarantee
will be introduced on a phased basis (pdf)</a>. By the end of 2015:</p>
<ul><li>Young people under 18 who have left the school system without completing
    secondary education and who are unemployed will be given a ‘second
    chance’ education pathway such as Youthreach or will be supported to
    re-enter the school system.</li>
  <li>Young people aged 18-24 who have been unemployed for 4 months will get
    help to find work or will get an offer of quality training, education or
    work experience.</li>
</ul><p>Currently a pilot Youth Guarantee project is underway in Ballymun. You can
visit <a href="http://www.youthguarantee.ie/">youthguarantee.ie</a> to find out
more about this pilot scheme.</p>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Youth-Guarantee-Activities.aspx">Youth
Guarantee</a> a range of initiatives are being put in place.</p>

<p>The qualifying period for <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/jobsplus.html">JobsPlus
(called JobsPlus Youth)</a> for jobseekers under 25 is 4 months from 1 January
2015. It will remain at 12 months for other jobseekers. Eligible young people
will be given certification that they qualify for the JobsPlus subsidy and they
can use this when applying for jobs.</p>

<p>A new <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/youth-development-internship.aspx">First
Steps Internship</a> is currently being put in place. Internships are expected
to start from March 2015. First Steps will be aimed at young people aged
between 18 and 24 who have little or no experience of work. First Steps is
similar to <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/national_internship_scheme.html">JobBridge</a>
but internships will not be publically advertised. DSP staff will select
candidates and refer them for interviews with organisations that have offered
internships. First Steps will offer extensive support to interns including a
work preparation course and a shorter internship week of 4 days. The Department
of Social Protection is currently seeking expressions of interest from
employers who wish to offer YDI placements.</p>

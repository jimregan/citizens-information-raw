<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>Jobseeker’s Allowance and Jobseeker’s Benefit are payments for people
who are unemployed and looking for work. To get either of these jobseeker’s
payments you must meet certain conditions or requirements. If you do not meet
these conditions you can be refused a payment, be disqualified from getting a
payment for a period or be paid a reduced rate of your payment.</p>

<p>You should also read our documents on the payments for detailed information
about each payment. For example, in the case of <a href="jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s Allowance</a> you must also
meet the means test criteria and the <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitual
residence condition</a> while to qualify for <a href="jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker’s Benefit</a> you must have
enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions and have suffered a substantial
loss of employment.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lc9cf2">Conditions for jobseeker's payments</h2>

<p>To qualify for a jobseeker’s payment you must be under 66 years of age.
You must be over 18 to claim Jobseeker’s Allowance and people under 18 do not
qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit.</p>

<p>You must also be:</p>
<ul><li>Unemployed (you must be fully unemployed or unemployed for at least 4
    days out of 7)</li>
  <li>Capable of work</li>
  <li>Available for work</li>
  <li>Genuinely seeking work</li>
</ul><p>While you are getting a jobseeker’s payment you must attend meetings and
take part in appropriate employment schemes, training or work experience if
requested by the Department of Social Protection. See ‘Sanctions for not
meeting the conditions of your jobseeker’s payment’ below.</p>

<h2>Unemployed</h2>

<p>To get a jobseeker’s payment you must be unemployed for at least 4 days
out of 7. This means that you can work for up to 3 days in a 7-day period and
still qualify for a jobseeker’s payment for the days you are not working. You
can also take up to <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/going_abroad_and_social_welfare_payments.html">two
weeks’ holiday in a year</a> and continue to get your payment.</p>

<p>However some people work the equivalent of full-time hours by doing
intensive shifts. It is usual for the Department of Social Protection to treat
people who work 36 hours or over in a week as being in full-time employment.
However, people who work a lower number of hours (perhaps as low as 30 hours
depending on the job) in a week may also be treated as being in full-time
employment. People in full-time employment do not qualify for a jobseeker’s
payment.</p>

<h3>Part-time work</h3>

<p>If you can only find part-time work or if your employer reduces your days at
work to 3 days a week or less, you may get a jobseeker’s payment for the
other days. You must meet the other conditions that apply to the payment, for
example, you must continue to look for full-time work. In the case of
Jobseeker’s Allowance, any income from work is assessed in the means test.
Read about:</p>
<ul><li><a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/work_and_jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s
    Allowance and work</a></li>
  <li><a href="../social_welfare_payments_and_work/jobseekers_benefit_and_work.html">Jobseeker’s
    Benefit and work</a></li>
</ul><h3>Retained firefighters and jobseeker’s payments</h3>

<p>If you are employed as a part-time retained firefighter, you may qualify for
a jobseeker’s payment. People who are working as part-time fire fighters do
not have to sign off for the days they are on call, firefighting or training.
This means that you can be paid a jobseeker’s payment for days that you are
on call, firefighting or training. Retained firefighters must live within 1.5
miles of the firestation and commit to being ready for firefighting duties in 5
minutes. This requirement in itself is not considered a restriction on your
availability for work, so long as you are satisfying the conditions of the
scheme. The Department of Social Protection requires you to be available for
full-time work and you must not restrict your search for employment to the 1.5
mile limit.</p>

<p>If you are claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance the income you receive will be
assessed in the normal way and any means will be set against your payment.</p>

<p>If you had a previous Jobseeker’s Benefit claim you can requalify for JB
once you pay 13 PRSI contributions assuming you satisfy all the other
conditions. The substantial loss condition does not apply to the employment as
a firefighter. However, if you have other employment then the substantial loss
condition applies to that other employment.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Voluntary work</h3>

<p>You may be able to do voluntary work and continue to get a jobseeker’s
payment. You must continue to satisfy the conditions of the payment, which
means that you must be available and looking for full-time work. You must also
get permission from a Deciding Officer at your social welfare local office or
Intreo centre. Find out more about <a href="../voluntary_work_and_social_welfare_payments.html">voluntary work and
social welfare payments</a>.</p>

<h3>On strike</h3>

<p>If you are on strike, you will not be considered unemployed and will not get
a jobseeker’s payment. However, if you are out of work as a result of a
strike, for example, you have been laid off because of the strike you may get a
jobseeker’s payment. You may get a jobseeker’s payment if you are "not
participating in or directly interested in the trade dispute which caused the
stoppage at work". If you are on strike your family may get <a href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/supplementary_welfare_allow.html">basic
Supplementary Welfare Allowance</a>.</p>

<h2>Capable of work</h2>

<p>You must be capable of work to qualify for a jobseeker’s payment. You are
considered capable of work unless you can produce medical evidence to prove
that you are not able to work. If you have spent some time incapable of work
you must produce a final medical certificate to prove that you are now fit for
work.</p>

<p>If you are ill and incapable of work you may be entitled to <a href="../disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability
Allowance</a> or <a href="../disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">Illness
Benefit</a>. If you are pregnant you are considered to be capable of work
unless you have complications during your pregnancy or you are ill. You can
read more in our document on <a href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/pregnancy_and_social_welfare_payments.html">pregnancy
and social welfare payments</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Available for work</h2>

<p>You are considered available for work if:</p>
<ul><li>You state that you are available for work</li>
  <li>You do all that is asked to show compliance with this availability
    condition</li>
  <li>There is no evidence to suggest the contrary</li>
</ul><p>Essentially the Department of Social Protection (DSP) considers that you are
available for work if you are prepared to accept any offers of suitable
employment immediately. In addition, the employment must be suitable, having
regard to your age, sex, physique, education, normal occupation, where you
live, rate of pay offered and your family circumstances.</p>

<p>However you can be regarded as not being available for work and therefore
not entitled to a jobseeker’s payment if you put unreasonable restrictions on
the following:</p>
<ul><li>The nature of the employment</li>
  <li>The hours of work</li>
  <li>The rate of pay</li>
  <li>The duration of the employment</li>
  <li>The location of the employment</li>
</ul><p>If a Deciding Officer thinks that that you have placed unreasonable
restrictions, you will be interviewed and given the opportunity to respond.
Note that if you refuse a suitable offer of work you can be disqualified from a
jobseeker’s payment.</p>

<p>For example, you are considered unavailable for work in the following
circumstances:</p>
<ul><li>You are looking for a particular type of work only. </li>
  <li>You state that you are looking for part-time work only. However, if you
    cannot get suitable full-time employment, you can still accept part-time
    work.</li>
  <li>You are only available during hours which are not typical of the
    employment you are looking for, for example, looking for clerical office
    work in evenings only. </li>
  <li>You are unwilling to take up an offer of reasonable short-time
    employment, for example, relief work or employment under a short-term
    contract. </li>
  <li>You move to a location where your prospects of getting suitable
    employment are significantly reduced. However, the reasons for the move
    will be taken into account. </li>
  <li>You are placing unreasonable restrictions on the distance which you are
    willing to travel to find work. However, access to public and private
    transport is taken into account. </li>
  <li>You may also be asked about your responsibilities at home, for example,
    who is looking after your child dependents. This question must be asked of
    both male and female applicants. </li>
</ul><p>If you are looking after a sick or older person and are not available for
work you may be entitled to a <a href="../carers/payments_to_carers.html">carer’s payment</a>.</p>

<p>You can read more about the available for work condition in the Department

<h2>Genuinely looking for work</h2>

<p>You must also show that you are genuinely looking for work. A day is not
treated as a day of unemployment unless on that day you are genuinely seeking
suitable full-time work. If you are in part-time employment and getting a
jobseeker's payment you must show that you are trying to get full-time
employment on the days you are not working.</p>

<p>You must be able to show that you are making genuine efforts to secure
employment. You need to provide examples of such steps. Steps which would
indicate that you are considered to be genuinely seeking work may include:</p>
<ul><li>Making oral or written applications for work</li>
  <li>Looking for information on the availability of employment from employers,
    advertisements and employment agencies</li>
  <li>Taking up reasonable training opportunities</li>
  <li>Acting on the advice given by a DSP case officer or other placement
    agency such as the Local Employment Service (LES)</li>
  <li>Taking positive, well advised steps towards establishing yourself in
    self-employment such as researching possible areas of self-employment</li>
  <li>Preparing business plans for a self-employment project</li>
  <li>Attending relevant "start your own business" courses or seeking
    information, advice or guidance in relation to any of these steps</li>
</ul><p></p>

<p>You can read more about the genuinely looking for work condition in the
Department of Social Protection's Operational Guidelines for <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Jobseekers-Allowance.aspx#condseekwork">Jobseeker's
Allowance</a> and <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Jobseekers-Benefit.aspx#gsw">Jobseeker's

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lc9813">Sanctions for not meeting the conditions of
your jobseeker’s payment</h2>

<p>You can be <em>refused</em> a jobseeker’s payment if you do not meet all
the conditions that apply to the payment. You can be <em>disqualified</em> from
a payment for a period of time in certain circumstances. You can also have your
<em>payment reduced</em> (and subsequently stopped altogether for a period of
time) if you do not attend meetings or participate in appropriate employment
schemes, training or work experience.</p>

<h3>Disqualification from a jobseeker’s payment</h3>

<p>You may be disqualified from getting a jobseeker’s payment for up to 9
weeks if you:</p>
<ul><li>Left work voluntarily and without just cause</li>
  <li>Lost your job through misconduct</li>
  <li>Refused or failed to engage with activation measures where a penalty rate
    applied (see below)</li>
</ul><p>You can be disqualified from Jobseeker’s Benefit if you are aged under 55
and get a redundancy payment of more than €50,000. The exact length of your
disqualification (up to 9 weeks) will depend on the amount of redundancy
payment you receive.</p>

<p>You can also be disqualified from a jobseeker’s payment if you do not
co-operate with the <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/public_services_card.html">Department
of Social Protection’s identity checking procedures for issuing you with a
Public Services Card</a>.</p>

<p>You can appeal <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_welfare_appeals.html">a
decision to disqualify you from a payment to the Social Welfare Appeals
Office</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Reduction in payment </h3>

<p>When you apply for a jobseeker’s payment you will be asked to sign a <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/record%20of%20mutual%20commitments.pdf">Record
of Mutual Commitments (pdf)</a> which explains your rights and responsibilities
while you are getting your jobseeker’s payment from the Department of Social
Protection (DSP).</p>

<p>Depending on your personal profile, you may be given an appointment for a
further meeting with a DSP case officer. At this meeting your case officer will
discuss your options with you and agree your Personal Progression Plan to
prepare you to find employment. You will get ongoing advice and support to help
you meet the goals in your Personal Progression Plan. You can read about the <a href="employment_supports.html">employment services the Department of Social
Protection offers to jobseekers</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not keep to the steps agreed in the Record of Mutual Commitments
and the other conditions of your jobseeker’s payment, your payment can be
reduced and eventually stopped altogether. Specifically you can be paid a
<em>penalty rate</em> of JA or JB if you refuse or fail to:</p>
<ul><li>Attend meetings requested by the DSP or</li>
  <li>Participate in an appropriate employment support scheme, work experience
    or training</li>
</ul><p>If you have been placed on a penalty rate and you continue not to meet the
conditions you can be disqualified from your jobseeker’s payment for up to 9
weeks. You cannot be disqualified immediately – a penalty rate must apply
first for at least 21 days.</p>

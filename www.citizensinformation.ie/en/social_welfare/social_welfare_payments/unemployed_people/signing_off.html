<p>You may get <a shape="rect" href="jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
Allowance</a>, <a shape="rect" href="jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker's
Benefit</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">credits</a>
if you are registered as a jobseeker</p>

<p>If you are registered as a jobseeker (in other words, signing-on with the
Department of Social Protection), you should inform <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/List-of-Social-Welfare-Local-and-Branch-Offices-by-County.aspx">your
local Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office</a> of the date when you
are going to start work. In some areas you can do this <a shape="rect" href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/secure/CloseClaim.aspx">online</a>. </p>

<p>Notifying your Intreo Centre or local Social Welfare Branch Office about
when you are going to start work will ensure that you can get any payment due
to you up to the date you start work. </p>

<p>You can also get advice about possibly keeping some of your existing
benefits and supports when you return to work. When you start work you may be
entitled to additional benefits, for example, <a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
Income Supplement</a> (FIS). </p>

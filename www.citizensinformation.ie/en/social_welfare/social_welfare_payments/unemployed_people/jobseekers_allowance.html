<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are unemployed, you may be paid either Jobseeker's Allowance (JA) or
<a shape="rect" href="jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker's Benefit (JB)</a>.
Both payments are paid by the Department of Social Protection (DSP).</p>

<p>You may get Jobseeker's Allowance if you don't qualify for Jobseeker's
Benefit or if you have used up your entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit. In some
cases, if you are only entitled to a reduced rate of Jobseeker's Benefit you
may be better off on Jobseeker's Allowance. However, Jobseeker's Allowance is
means-tested and your means must be below a certain level to qualify.</p>

<p>The <a href="jobseekers_allowance_transition.html">Jobseeker’s
Transitional payment (JST)</a> is a special arrangement under the Jobseeker’s
Allowance scheme that aims to support lone parents into the workforce while
they have young children. This payment is available to people parenting alone
whose youngest child is aged between 7 and 13 years inclusive. </p>

<h3>Intreo - the integrated employment and support service</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Intreo.aspx">Intreo is a service
from the Department of Social Protection</a> which provides a single point of
contact for all employment and income supports. Details of Intreo Centre
locations are published on <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/List-of-Social-Welfare-Local-and-Branch-Offices-by-County.aspx">welfare.ie</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To get Jobseeker's Allowance you must be aged over 18 and under 66. You must
also:</p>
<ul><li>Be unemployed (you must be fully unemployed or unemployed for at least 4
    days out of 7) </li>
  <li>Be capable of work </li>
  <li>Be available for full-time work and genuinely seeking work </li>
  <li>Satisfy the <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/means_test_for_jobseekers_allowance.html">means
    test</a> <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pages/intreo_home.aspx"></a></li>
  <li>Meet the <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">habitual
    residence condition</a></li>
</ul><p>You can read more about <a href="conditions_for_getting_a_jobseekers_payment.html">the conditions for
getting a jobseeker's payment</a> and about the <a href="employment_supports.html">employment services the Department of Social
Protection offers to jobseekers</a>. </p>

<p><a href="../disability_and_illness/older_jobseekers.html">There are some
special provisions for older jobseekers</a> and for <a href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/pregnancy_and_social_welfare_payments.html">pregnant
women</a>.</p>

<h3>Jobseeker's Allowance and work</h3>

<p>You must be unemployed to get Jobseeker’s Allowance. You must also be
capable of, available for, and genuinely seeking full-time work to qualify for
Jobseeker’s Allowance – and you must be able to show evidence of this to
the Department of Social Protection. However, there are circumstances in which
you can do some work and get Jobseeker’s Allowance. Income from work affects
the amount of Jobseeker’s Allowance you get. </p>

<p>If you get part-time or casual work (up to and including 3 days per week),
you may still be paid Jobseeker's Allowance for the other days. However, you
must show that you are trying to get full-time employment. If your employer
reduces your days at work to 3 days week or less, you may get Jobseeker's
Allowance for the other days. You must meet the other conditions that apply to
Jobseeker's Allowance, for example, you must satisfy a means test. There is an
exemption from some of the rules for retained firefighters.</p>

<p>If you have been getting long-term Jobseeker's Allowance (over 390 days or
15 months) and you take up part-time work for less than 24 hours a week you may
be eligible for the <a href="../social_welfare_payments_and_work/part_time_job_incentive_scheme.html">Part-time
Job Incentive Scheme (PTJI).</a> This scheme allows you to take up part-time
work and get a special weekly allowance instead of your jobseeker’s payment.
</p>

<p>Find out more about <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/work_and_jobseekers_allowance.html">how
income from work is assessed for Jobseeker’s Allowance</a>. You can also take
up to <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/going_abroad_and_social_welfare_payments.html">two
weeks holiday in a year</a> and continue to get your payment.</p>

<p>If you are getting JA you can use a <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Benefit-of-Work-Ready-Reckoner-Introduction.aspx">Benefit
of Work Ready Reckoner</a> from the Department of Social Protection to help you
assess the financial consequences of taking up full-time work. The Reckoner
works out the total amount you would receive on taking up full-time work
(including any Family Income Supplement) and compares this to what you are
getting in jobseeker payments (including Rent Supplement).<a></a> A <a href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/back_to_work_family_dividend.html"></a><a href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/back_to_work_family_dividend.html">Back
to Work Family Dividend</a> has been introduced for lone parent and long-term
jobseeker families with children who find or return to work from January 2015.
</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Self-employment</strong></p>

<p>If you are self-employed, you may be entitled to Jobseeker's Allowance,
depending on your income from your business. You can find out more about <a shape="rect" href="self_employed_and_unemployment.html">self-employment and
unemployment</a>. Self-employed farmers on a low income can apply for <a shape="rect" href="../farming_and_fishing/farm_assist.html">Farm Assist</a>.
</p>

<h3>Means test</h3>

<p>Jobseeker's Allowance is a means-tested payment. Your means must be below a
certain level to get Jobseeker’s Allowance. A means test looks at all your
household sources of income including <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/assessing_the_means_of_a_couple.html">your
spouse’s, civil partner’s or <em>cohabitant's</em> income</a>. (A
cohabitant is a person living in an intimate and committed relationship with a
person of the same or opposite sex who is not that person’s spouse, civil
partner, or a close relative.) </p>

<p>However, <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/cash_income_not_included_in_the_social_welfare_means_test.html">some
income may not be taken into account</a>. Your total household means is
deducted from the maximum payment for your household's circumstances to find
the actual amount of Jobseeker’s Allowance you are entitled to. </p>

<p>If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is getting a social welfare
payment in his or her own right (with some exceptions) or is on a <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/vocational_education_and_training/fas_training_courses.html">Further
Education and Training (FET) course</a> or <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/returning_to_education/vocational_training_opportunities_scheme.html">VTOS
course</a> and getting an allowance you will not get an Increase for a
Qualified Adult but you will get a half-rate increase for any qualified
children. A <em>limitation</em> applies which means that if you are claiming
Jobseeker's Allowance and your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is getting
certain social welfare payments, the total amount paid to you as a couple
cannot be more than the maximum amount that would be paid to one person
(including adult and child dependants) on one social welfare payment. Find out
more about <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/means_test_for_jobseekers_allowance.html">the
means test for Jobseeker’s Allowance</a>.</p>

<p>You can claim an increase for your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant while
they are taking part in a <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/community_employment_scheme.html">Community
Employment (CE)</a>,<a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/tus.html">Tús</a>
or <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/gateway_scheme.html">Gateway</a>
scheme. Their earnings from the scheme are assessed in the same way as earnings
from insurable employment (and your combined means are not halved). </p>

<p>If you are <strong>24 years of age or under</strong> and you are living with
a parent or a step-parent in the family home, some of your parents' income will
also be taken into account in the assessment for Jobseeker's Allowance. The
Department call this an assessment of the 'benefit and privilege' you get from
living with your parents. Find out more about <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/how_parents_income_can_affect_jobseekers_allowance.html">how
living with your parents is assessed in the means test.</a></p>

<h3>Disqualification and reduction in payment </h3>

<p>You may be disqualified from getting Jobseeker's Allowance for 9 weeks if
you:</p>
<ul><li>Left work voluntarily and without just cause </li>
  <li>Lost your job through misconduct </li>
  <li>Refused an offer of suitable employment or training - if you have been on
    a penalty rate of JA for at least 21 days</li>
</ul><p>Your payment can be reduced if you refuse or fail to attend meetings
requested by the Department or if you refuse or fail to participate in an
appropriate employment support scheme, work experience or training (see also
<em>Penalty rates</em> below). Read more about <a href="conditions_for_getting_a_jobseekers_payment.html">sanctions that may
apply if you do not fulfil the conditions of your jobseeker's payment</a>. </p>

<h3>Students</h3>

<p>If you have just left school you cannot get Jobseeker's Allowance. To get
Jobseeker's Allowance you must have been out of school for 3 months and you
must be at least 18 years of age. </p>

<p>Third-level students cannot claim Jobseeker's Allowance or Benefit while
they are studying full-time. This disqualification also applies to the summer
holiday periods between academic years (unless <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Jobseekers-Allowance.aspx#condavailwork">you
are a mature student</a>). However once you have finished college permanently
you can claim a jobseeker's payment if you cannot find work. This is also the
case if you leave college without finishing your course. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Jobseekers-Allowance.aspx#StudentDisqualifications">3
month disqualification rule</a> does not apply to Youthreach participants.</p>

<h3>Short-term employment or training</h3>

<p>The Department of Social Protection operates a fast-tracking system for
people who sign off a jobseeker's payment to take up work for a short period
(up to 12 weeks) or to go on a short training course (up to 12 weeks). This
ensures that your payment is re-instated without delay. It is important that
you inform your Intreo Centre or local Social Welfare Branch Office in advance
that you are taking up work or training. Your <a href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a> claim can also be suspended for up to 12 weeks.</p>

appropriate employment support scheme, work experience or training. You can
find out about sanctions for not meeting <a href="conditions_for_getting_a_jobseekers_payment.html">the conditions of
your jobseeker's payment.</a> Penalty rates do not apply to people over 62. </p>

<h3>Payments for dependants</h3>

<p>If you qualify for Jobseeker’s Allowance you get an amount for yourself,
which is called the 'personal rate of payment'. You may also get an increase in
your payment for an <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">adult
dependant</a> and <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_and_increase_in_your_payment_for_a_child_dependant.html">any
child dependants</a> you may have. </p>

<p><strong>Child dependants<br></strong>A <em>child dependant</em> is usually a child up to 18 years of age
who lives with you. </p>

<p>If you have been getting Jobseeker’s Allowance for at least 156 days and
your child is in full-time education, an Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC)
will be paid up to 22 years of age or up to the end of the academic year in
which he or she reaches 22. You will only get a half-rate IQC if you and your
spouse, civil partner or cohabitant are both getting a social welfare payment.
You will each get a half-rate IQC.</p>

<p><strong>Adult dependants</strong><br>
You may get an Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA) for an adult dependant
(this is usually your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant). If you are single,
widowed, divorced, separated, a former civil partner or not living with your
civil partner, and living with a person aged 16 or over, you can claim an IQA
for them but only if he or she is caring for a child dependant of yours.</p>

<p>If your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant works or is taking part in a
Community Employment (CE scheme), Tús or Gateway their earnings from insurable
employment are assessed in the same way as your earnings from part-time or
casual work. Find out more about <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/work_and_jobseekers_allowance.html">work

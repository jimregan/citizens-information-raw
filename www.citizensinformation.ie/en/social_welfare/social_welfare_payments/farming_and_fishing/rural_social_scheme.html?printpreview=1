<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Rural Social Scheme (RSS) is aimed at low-income farmers and
fishermen/women. To qualify for the RSS you must be getting a social welfare
payment. In return, people participating in the RSS provide services that
benefit rural communities. </p>

<p>The Department of Social Protection has overall responsibility for policy in
relation to the Rural Social Scheme, including eligibility criteria. The
Department monitors the implementation of the RSS and supports the various
bodies that manage the RSS locally. The Department may also inspect any Scheme
and visit projects. At a local level, the Scheme is managed by implementing
bodies such as local development companies and in the Gaeltacht areas, by
Údarás na Gaeltachta.</p>

<h3>What type of work is carried out by people participating in the Scheme?</h3>

<p>The type of work carried out by RSS participants includes:</p>
<ul><li>Maintaining and enhancing various walking routes (that is, waymarked
    ways, agreed walks) and bog roads </li>
  <li>Energy conservation work for older people and those at risk of poverty
  </li>
  <li>Village and countryside enhancement projects </li>
  <li>Social care and care of older people</li>
  <li>Community care for pre-school and after-school groups</li>
  <li>Environmental maintenance work - maintenance and caretaking of community
    and sporting facilities </li>
  <li>Projects relating to not-for-profit cultural and heritage centres </li>
  <li>Community administration or clerical work </li>
  <li>Any other appropriate community-based project</li>
</ul><h3>How many hours' work is involved and how long does the Scheme last? </h3>

<p>You work 19.5 hours per week. These hours are based on a
farmer/fisher-friendly schedule. This is to ensure participation on the scheme
does not affect a your farming/fishing activities. If you get a place on the
Scheme, you are offered a contract from your start date up to the following 31
March. You may be considered for a further term following the initial contract,
if you continue to meet all the criteria for the Scheme. </p>

<p>The local management decides on your application. While it is not intended
that anyone would remain on the scheme permanently, there is no definite time
limit for participation.</p>

<p>If you are eligible for the Scheme but don’t wish to participate, your
dependent spouse, civil partner or cohabitant may take the available place.
However, this is only if neither of you are participating in any other similar
scheme, (for example, the Community Employment Scheme.) The Rural Social Scheme
operates independently of the <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/community_employment_scheme.html">Community
Employment Scheme (CE)</a>. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The Rural Social Scheme provides a supplementary income for low-income
farmers and fishermen/women who are unable to earn an adequate living. </p>

<p>To participate in the scheme you must be getting:</p>
<ul><li>Farm Assist</li>
</ul><p>Or</p>

<p>If you are actively farming or fishing (this means that you must meet the
criteria set out below), you may qualify for the scheme if you are also getting
one of the following social welfare payments: </p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
    Allowance</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance_transition.html">Jobseeker's
    Transitional payment</a></li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability
    Allowance</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent
    Family Payment</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../death_related_benefits/widows_contrib_pension.html">Widow's,
    Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../death_related_benefits/widows_non_contrib_pen.html">Widow's,Widower's
    or Surviving Civil Partner's Non-Contributory Pension</a></li>
  <li>Increase for a Qualified Adult under 66 years of age as part of your
    spouse, cohabitant or civil partner's <a shape="rect" href="../older_and_retired_people/state_pension_non_contributory.html">State
    Pension (Non-Contributory)</a></li>
</ul><p>Note that since 1 January 2016, Jobseeker's Benefit (if you had previously
been on Community Employment or the Rural Social Scheme within the last 12
months) is no longer a qualifying payment for RSS. If you are getting JB you
can apply for Farm Assist or Jobseeker's Allowance which are qualifying
payments for RSS.</p>

<h3>Actively farming/fishing criteria</h3>

<p><strong>Criteria for a farmer<br></strong>You must provide proof that you are actively farming. To do this, you
must provide a copy of your application for the EU Single Payment Scheme for
the current year, including a valid herd number. If you are actively farming
and have not applied for the EU Single Payment Scheme, you should contact your
local implementing body for advice.</p>

<p><strong>Criteria for a child/sibling of a farmer<br></strong>If you are a child/sibling of a herd number owner and you can certify
that you are resident and/or working on the farm and you are getting one of the
qualifying social welfare payments, you may be eligible to participate in the
RSS on the basis of your parent’s/sibling’s herd number. </p>

<p><strong>Criteria for a spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of a farmer<br></strong>If you are eligible but do not wish to participate in the RSS, your
dependent spouse, civil partner or cohabitant can take the available place.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is getting one of
the qualifying social welfare payments and is actively farming, they can use
your herd number to qaulify for the scheme.</p>

<p>Your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant can participate in the RSS, if
he/she is under 66 and you are getting a State Pension (Non-Contributory) which
includes an Increase for Qualified Adult for him or her.</p>

<p><strong>Criteria for a fisherman/woman</strong></p>

<p>To be considered eligible to participate on the RSS a fisherman/woman must
meet one of the following categories:</p>
<ul><li>

    the Register of Fishing Boats.</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    Self-employed fisherman/woman whose boat has been issued with a pot fishing
    licence. The Department of Communication, Energy and Natural Resources

  </li>
</ul><p><strong>Criteria for a spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of a

</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The rates of payment for new participants on the RSS depends on your
qualifying Department of Social Protection (DSP) payment. The minimum weekly
payment increased to <strong>€215.50 from March 2017</strong>.</p>

<p>From March 2017, if the actual social welfare payment (including dependants)
you were getting was €193 a week or less, then you will get the minimum RSS
weekly rate of €215.50 (that is €193 plus €22.50). If your actual weekly
social welfare payment (including dependants) was €193.01 or more, then you
will get the equivalent rate plus €22.50.</p>

<p>If you were getting an age-related reduced rate of payment your payment is
increased to the minimum weekly rate of €215.50. </p>

<p><strong>PRSI contribution</strong></p>

<p>A Class A PRSI contribution is paid on behalf of all RSS participants. You
are not liable for the <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">Universal
Social Charge (USC)</a> on your RSS payment.</p>

<p><strong>Tax</strong></p>

<p>Your income is liable for tax although it is likely you will pay little or
no tax. Find out <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/">more
about tax</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Other social welfare payments</strong></p>

<p>If you are getting other social welfare payments you should check with your
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/ContactUs/Pages/localoffice.aspx">Intreo centre
or social welfare local office</a> to find out whether they will be affected.
You can retain your <a href="../../../health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">medical
card </a> while you are taking part in the Rural Social Scheme. </p>

<h4>Changes to your circumstances</h4>

<p>The rules that apply to your original social welfare payment also apply to
your RSS payment. This means that, if your dependant gets a job, their income
will be assessed as means and your RSS payment may be reduced. Your RSS payment
cannot be reduced below the minimum rate of €215.50. To avoid any possible
overpayments, if there is any change in your circumstances, you should inform
your local RSS implementing body. </p>

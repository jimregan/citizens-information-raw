<p>The Bereavement Grant was a once-off payment to help with funeral costs.
Eligibility for this grant was not related to your ability to pay for the
funeral. Eligibility was usually based on PRSI contributions.
<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>The Bereavement Grant has been discontinued and is not paid for
deaths occurring on or after 1 January 2014.</strong> Applications for
bereavement grants will be accepted up to December 2014, provided the date of
death is before 1 January 2014. Note that applications for bereavement grants
must be submitted within 12 months of the date of death.</p>

<p>The Funeral Grant under the Occupational Injuries Scheme will continue to be
paid. The six weeks' payment after death (where the deceased person’s payment
continues for 6 weeks to their spouse or partner who is also getting a weekly
welfare payment), the Widowed or Surviving Civil Partner’s Grant of €6,000
and assistance with funeral costs under Exceptional Needs Payments are
unaffected.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>A Bereavement Grant is paid on the death of:</p>
<ul><li>An insured person</li>
  <li>The spouse or civil partner of an insured person</li>
  <li>The widow or widower of an insured person</li>
  <li>A child under age 18, or under age 22 if in full-time education (where
    either parent or the person that the child normally lives with satisfies
    the PRSI contribution conditions)</li>
  <li>A contributory pensioner</li>
  <li>A spouse or civil partner of a contributory pensioner,</li>
  <li>The <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">qualified

be paid a non-contributory pension at a higher rate, they or their spouse,
civil partner or dependants are still eligible for a Bereavement Grant. Also,
someone for whom the contributory pensioner would have been getting an Increase
for a Qualified Adult, but for the fact that they were getting a
non-contributory payment in their own right will qualify (for example, a
contributory pensioner's spouse or civil partner who is getting a Carer's
Allowance, State Pension (Non-Contributory) or Blind Pension.)</p>

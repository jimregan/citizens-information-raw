<h3>Death of the person claiming a social welfare payment</h3>

<p>Some social welfare payments can continue after someone dies. That is, where
someone who was getting a certain social welfare payment dies, their spouse,
civil partner or cohabitant may get 6 weeks of this payment after the death.
This will be paid at the same rate your late spouse, civil partner or
cohabitant was getting. You may get the 6-week payment if your spouse, civil
partner or cohabitant was getting one of the following payments and it included
a payment (<a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">Increase

spouse, civil partner or cohabitant was also getting one of the payments listed
above in his or her own right, you may also continue to get your spouse's,
civil partner's or cohabitant's payment for 6 weeks after their death, plus

<h3>Death of an adult dependant</h3>

<p>If you are getting a social welfare payment that included a payment
(Increase for a Qualified Adult) for your late spouse, civil partner or
cohabitant, you will continue to get the same rate of payment for 6 weeks after
their death.</p>

<h3>Death of a child dependant</h3>

<p>If your child dies, payment of an <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_and_increase_in_your_payment_for_a_child_dependant.html">Increase
for a Qualified Child</a> on your social welfare payment will usually continue
for 6 weeks, if the child was included in your payment. Contact the section of
the Department of Social Protection responsible for your payment.</p>

<p>You should also notify the <a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child
Benefit</a> Section of the Department about the death of the child. </p>

<h3>Where a person being cared for dies</h3>

<p>Payment of <a shape="rect" href="../carers/carers_allowance.html">Carer's
Allowance</a> (full or half-rate) continues to be made for 12 weeks after the
death of the person you were caring for. Payment of <a shape="rect" href="../carers/carers_benefit.html">Carer's Benefit</a> continues to be made
for 6 weeks after the death of the person you were caring for.</p>

<p>If you are getting Carer’s Allowance (full or half-rate) on behalf of a
spouse, civil partner or cohabitant and that person dies, you can continue to
get Carer's Allowance for 12 weeks plus any of the payments listed above (if in
payment to that person) for 6 weeks after the date of death. If you were
getting Carer’s Benefit you continue to get it for 6 weeks and any payments
your spouse or partner was getting. </p>

<p>If you are getting one of the other payments listed above and your deceased
spouse, civil partner or cohabitant was getting Carer's Allowance for you, you
will continue to get your payments plus Carer’s Allowance (full or half-rate)
for 6 weeks after the date of death. You continue to get Carer's Benefit for 6
weeks.</p>

<p>In all cases you must inform the Department of Social Protection of the

<p>The 6-week payment is normally paid in a lump sum by cheque. Carer’s Allowance continues to be paid weekly after a death.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>To apply for a payment after death, you should contact the appropriate
section within the Department of Social Protection, as soon as possible
following the death. (The section you need to contact will depend on the type
of payment the deceased received. For example, if the person who died was
getting a State Pension, you need to get in touch with the Pension Section of
the Department, etc.). Staff in your local Intreo centre or social welfare
office can advise if you are not sure where to contact. </p>

<p>Enclose the death certificate (if available) or a death notice from a
newspaper with your application. A cheque will be sent to you. Keep your own
record of the pension claim/reference number for future reference</p>

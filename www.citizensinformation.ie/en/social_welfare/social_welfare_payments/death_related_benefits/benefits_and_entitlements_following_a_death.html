<p>After a bereavement you may need financial support. The Department of Social
Protection provides certain once-off payments to help out families during this
difficult time. Your local Department of Social Protection's representative
(formerly known as the Community Welfare Officer) deals with some of these
payments.</p>

<p>You must have made a certain number of PRSI contributions to be eligible for
some social welfare payments. You may be eligible for other payments, if you
pass a means test or if you are in urgent need. Time limits apply for many
payments, so apply as early as is possible.</p>

<p>You cannot be expected to do everything right away, but if the deceased was
getting a social welfare payment or you were claiming for them as a dependant
or you were getting a Carer's Allowance to look after them, it's important that
you notify the Department of Social Protection within the first few days of the
death. </p>

<p>Notifying the Department does not mean the payment will be taken back
immediately. In many cases, the spouse, civil partner, cohabitant, parent or
carer may continue to receive a <a shape="rect" href="social_welfare_payments_following_a_death.html">payment for six weeks
following the death</a>. </p>

<h3>Help with funeral costs</h3>

<p>You can get help with the cost of the funeral:</p>
<ul><li>The <a href="widowed_persons_bereavement_grant.html">Widowed or
    Surviving Civil Partner Grant</a> is a once-off payment to
    widows/widowers/surviving civil partners with dependent children.This
    payment was formerly called the Widowed Parent Grant. </li>
  <li>If someone dies from an accident at work, a <a shape="rect" href="special_funeral_grant.html">Funeral Grant</a> is available. </li>
  <li>The <a shape="rect" href="standard_bereavement_grant.html">Bereavement
    Grant</a> was discontinued in 2014. </li>
</ul><p>Whether you qualify or not for one of the above grants you may be eligible
for an Exceptional Needs Payment to <a shape="rect" href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/exceptional_needs_payments.html">help
with funeral costs if you are on a low income</a>. Each case is decided on its
merits. The Community Welfare Service prefers if you apply before the funeral
takes place, but in practice, most people apply afterwards.</p>

<p>In many cases a payment or a grant cannot be paid until all the necessary
documentation is received. If you are claiming the grant, you are responsible
for the production of certificates, documents and any information required, for
example:</p>
<ul><li>Death certificate </li>
  <li>Birth certificate </li>
  <li>Marriage or Civil Partnership certificate (to prove your relationship to
    the deceased) </li>
  <li>Funeral receipts </li>
  <li>The deceased person's Personal Public Service number (PPS number) </li>
  <li>Your PPS number may also be required </li>
</ul><h3>Main payments</h3>

<p>If you were living with or dependent on the deceased, any current benefits
or payments you are getting may change, or you may be able to claim additional
benefits. Depending on your income and circumstances you may be entitled to a
social welfare payment in your own right, for example:</p>

<p>A <a shape="rect" href="widows_contrib_pension.html">Widow's, Widower's or
Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension</a> and related social welfare
benefits may be payable if either you or your deceased spouse or civil partner
has enough PRSI contributions. This payment was formerly called the
Widow's/Widower's (Contributory) Pension.</p>

<p>A <a shape="rect" href="widows_non_contrib_pen.html">Widow's, Widower's or
Surviving Civil Partner's Non-Contributory Pension</a> is paid to widowed
people or surviving civil partners without dependent children, who do not
qualify for a contributory pension and who pass a means test. This payment was
formerly called the Widow's/Widower's (Non-Contributory) Pension.</p>

<p>A <a shape="rect" href="guardians_payments.html">Guardian's payment</a> is
paid to the child's guardian up to the child's 18th birthday or 22nd birthday
if he or she is in full-time education. </p>

<p>A <a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent
Family Payment</a> can be paid to you if you are parenting alone as a result of
the death of your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant. If you also qualify for
a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension you will
have to choose which payment is of most benefit to you because you cannot get
both.</p>

<p>If a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease, <a shape="rect" href="dependent_parents_pension.html">Death Benefit under the
Occupational Injuries Scheme</a> may be paid to their surviving spouse or civil
partner.</p>

<h3>Additional payments</h3>

<p>Bereavement can cause financial difficulties. The <a shape="rect" href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/">Supplementary Welfare Allowance
Scheme</a> provides financial support to people with low incomes. You may
qualify for a weekly supplement payment under the scheme to meet certain
special needs, for example, help with rent and fuel costs. In addition,
payments can also be made for urgent or exceptional needs.</p>

<p>There are specific rules about taxation in the year of a person's death, for
example, a tax refund may be due. There are also extra credits for parents in
the years following the death of a spouse or civil partner. <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs_following_a_death.html">Find

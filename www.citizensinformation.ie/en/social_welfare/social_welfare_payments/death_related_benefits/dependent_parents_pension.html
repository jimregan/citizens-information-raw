<h3>Widow's Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Pension </h3>

<p>This is paid to the surviving spouse or civil partner of a person who died
as a result of an accident at work, an occupational disease or who was getting
a Disablement Pension asssessed as 50% or more at the time of their death. You
cannot get the pension if you remarry, enter into a civil partnership or
cohabit with another person. The pension is not affected by any income you may
have. Increases for qualified children are paid with the pension. <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">The
pension is taxable</a>.</p>

<p>A Widow's Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Pension under the Death
Benefit Scheme cannot be paid at the same time as a <a href="widows_contrib_pension.html">Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil
Partner's Contributory Pension</a>.</p>

<h3>Orphan's Pension</h3>

<p>This is paid on behalf of a child if the parent, step-parent or person who
supported the child died as a result of an accident at work, an occupational
disease or was getting a Disablement Pension assessed as 50% or more at the
time of their death. The orphan's guardian should apply for the payment. </p>

<h3>Funeral Grant</h3>

<p>If the deceased person meets the conditions a <a href="special_funeral_grant.html">special Funeral Grant</a> can be paid to
the person who pays for the funeral expenses. A Funeral Grant is not taxable.

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension is a
weekly payment to the husband, wife or civil partner of a deceased person. This
payment was formerly called the Widow's/Widower's (Contributory) Pension.
Either you or your deceased spouse or civil partner must have enough <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social
insurance contributions (PRSI)</a>. </p>

<p>To qualify you must, of course, be a widow, widower or surviving civil
partner and you must not be cohabiting with another person. </p>

<p>If you are divorced and you would have been entitled to a Widow's, Widower's
or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension had you remained married,
you keep your entitlement to the Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil
Partner's (Contributory) Pension. </p>

<p>If your civil partnership has been dissolved and you would have been
entitled to a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory)
Pension had you remained in the civil partnership, you keep your entitlement to
the Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension. </p>

<p>The pension is payable regardless of other income.</p>
</div>

<p>Since 27 December 2013, new applicants for Widow's, Widow(er)'s Contributory
Pension and Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension need 260 paid PRSI
contributions to qualify (previously 156 contributions were required). You can

Asked Questions (FAQs) about this pension on welfare.ie</a>. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You may automatically qualify for a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil
Partner's (Contributory) Pension if your late spouse or civil partner was
getting either a State Pension (Transition) or <a shape="rect" href="../older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html">State
Pension (Contributory)</a>, which included an increase for a dependent spouse
or civil partner (or would have included an increase but for the fact that you
were getting <a shape="rect" href="../older_and_retired_people/state_pension_non_contributory.html">State
Pension (Non-Contributory)</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../disability_and_illness/blind_persons_pension.html">Blind Pension</a>
or <a shape="rect" href="../carers/carers_allowance.html">Carer's
Allowance</a>). </p>

<p>There is no automatic qualification if your late spouse or civil partner was
getting a mixed insurance pro-rata, EU/Bilateral Agreement pro-rata or Pre-53
pension. In all such cases you should apply for Widow's, Widower's or Surviving
Civil Partner’s Contributory Pension in the normal way.</p>

<p>If you do not automatically qualify for a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving
Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension, then either you or your late spouse or
civil partner must have a certain number of PRSI contributions. </p>

<h3>Social insurance contributions (PRSI)</h3>

<p>To qualify for a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's
(Contributory) Pension, either you or your late spouse or civil partner must
have a certain number of PRSI contributions. All the PRSI requirements must be
met on <strong>one person's record</strong> - you may not combine the
contributions of both spouses or civil partners. All must have been made before
the death of the spouse or civil partner.</p>

<p>Virtually all PRSI contributions count towards this pension, including
contributions paid by public servants and the self-employed. </p>

<p>Either you or your spouse or civil partner must have:</p>
<ul><li>At least 260 paid contributions paid before the <em>relevant
  date</em>*</li>
</ul><p><strong>And</strong> </p>
<ul><li>An average of 39 paid or credited contributions in either the 3 or 5
    years before the death of the spouse or civil partner or before he or she
    reached pension age (66) </li>
</ul><p><strong>Or</strong> </p>
<ul><li>A yearly average of at least 24 paid or credited contributions from the
    year of first entry into insurance until the year of death or reaching
    pension age. If this average is used then an average of 24 will entitle you
    to a minimum pension, you will need an average of 48 per year to get the
    full pension. </li>
</ul><p>*The relevant date is the earliest of the following dates:</p>
<ul><li>The date your spouse or civil partner died</li>
  <li>Your spouse’s or civil partner’s 66th birthday, if their social
    insurance record is used </li>
  <li>Your 66th birthday, if your social insurance record is used</li>
</ul><p>If your spouse or civil partner died before 27 December 2013, only 156 paid
contributions are required. However the yearly average condition must still be
satisfied. </p>

<h3>Contributions paid in other EU member states</h3>

<p>If you were previously insurably employed in a country covered by EU
Regulations or in a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security
agreement and you have paid at least one full rate PRSI contribution in
Ireland, you may combine your insurance record in that country with your Irish
PRSI contributions to help you qualify for Widow's, Widower's or Surviving
Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension. </p>

<p>More information is available in our document about <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/social_insurance_contributions_from_abroad.html">combining
your social insurance contributions from abroad</a>. </p>

<h3>Other earnings and payments</h3>

<p>Since this is a contributory pension, you may earn any amount of money from
any other source and still remain entitled to this pension. <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">It
is taxable</a>. If it is your only source of income, you are unlikely to have
to pay tax.</p>

<p>You <em>cannot</em> get a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's
Contributory Pension at the same time as a <a shape="rect" href="../older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html">State
Pension (Contributory)</a>. If you are entitled to both payments you will be
paid whichever is the higher amount. If you wish to receive the lower amount,
you should contact the Department of Social Protection (see 'Where to apply'
below). </p>

<p>You cannot get a <a href="../../../education/vocational_education_and_training/fas_training_allowances.html">training
allowance</a> at the same time as a Widow’s, Widower’s or Surviving Civil
Partner’s Contributory Pension.</p>

<p>You cannot get a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's
Contributory Pension and half- rate <a shape="rect" href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker's Benefit</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">Illness
Benefit</a> or <a shape="rect" href="../disability_and_illness/occupational_injuries_benefit_overview.html">Incapacity
Supplement</a>. However, you can get a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil
Partner's Contributory Pension and half-rate <a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/maternity_benefit.html">Maternity
Benefit</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/health_safety_benefit.html">Health

Benefit</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../carers/half_rate_carers_allowance.html">Carer's Allowance</a> if you
also qualify for one of these payments.</p>

<p>Since 16 January 2012, you cannot get a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving
Civil Partner's Contributory Pension in addition to full payment on a <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/community_employment_scheme.html">Community
Employment Scheme</a>. You will be paid by the CE sponsor and your payment will
be the equivalent of your previous personal rate of Widow's, Widower's or
Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension plus €20 per week.</p>

<p>You can claim <a href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
Income Supplement</a> (if you meet the criteria) and get a Widow's, Widower's
or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension at the same time. Your
widow's pension is assessed as means. </p>

<h3>Duration</h3>

<p>The pension remains payable while you remain widowed or a surviving civil
partner. If you re-marry, enter a new civil partnership or start to cohabit, it
is no longer payable.</p>

<p>You may get <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_and_increase_in_your_payment_for_a_child_dependant.html">increases
for qualified children</a> with your pension - these remain payable while the
child is aged under 18 and they may then be continued until age 22 if the child
is in full-time education.</p>

<h3>Other payments for widowed people and surviving civil partners</h3>

<p>Under the Occupational Injuries Scheme, a widow's, widower's or surviving
civil partner's pension may be payable if the death was due to an occupational
injury or disease. </p>

<p>People getting a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's
(Contributory) Pension are eligible for the <a shape="rect" href="../extra_social_welfare_benefits/household_benefits_package.html">Household
Benefits Package</a> if they meet the usual conditions. </p>

<p>If your spouse or partner was getting a Household Benefits Package when they
died you can keep the package if you are aged 60 or over (even though you do
not meet the usual age requirement).</p>

<p>People living on islands can face extra expenses travelling to the mainland
to avail of services. If you are getting one of the social welfare payments
listed below and living on certain islands off the coast of Ireland you can get
an increase in your social welfare payment (sometimes referred to as an Island
Allowance). The purpose of the increase is to compensate for the additional
costs of living on an island off the coast of Ireland.</p>

<p>Since March 2005, people getting certain pensions from another EU state are
entitled to an increase for living on a specified island.</p>

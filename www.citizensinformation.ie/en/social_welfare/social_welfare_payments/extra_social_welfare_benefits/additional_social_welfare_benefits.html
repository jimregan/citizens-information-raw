<p>If you are getting a social assistance payment or a social insurance payment
from the Department of Social Protection you may be entitled to additional or
extra benefits depending on your personal circumstances. </p>

<p>In some cases, you can get a benefit even if you are not getting a social
welfare payment. For example, everyone over 66 is entitled to a Free Travel
Pass. </p>

<p>To get an extra benefit you must satisfy the qualifying criteria. For
example, to get the Living Alone Increase you must be getting a certain social
welfare payment and be living alone. </p>

<p>In some cases you automatically get an additional benefit. For example, if
you get Invalidity Pension you automatically get a Free Travel Pass. However,
for most additional benefits you must apply separately. </p>

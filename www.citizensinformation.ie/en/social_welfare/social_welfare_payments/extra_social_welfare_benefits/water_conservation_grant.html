<p><strong>The Water Conservation Grant has been suspended for 2016. No grant will be available in 2016.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The details below relate to the 2015 Water Conservation Grant.</strong></p>

<p>A new <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Water-Charges-and-your-Water-Conservation-Grant.aspx">Water
Conservation Grant</a> was introduced in 2015. To qualify for the grant in 2015
your household must have registered with <a href="https://www.water.ie/">Irish
Water</a> by 30 June 2015.</p>

<p>You can use the grant as you choose, for example, as a contribution towards
<a href="../../../environment/water_services/water_charges.html">your water
bills</a>, fixing water leaks, installing a water conservation system,
maintaining your well or de-sludging your septic tank. There will be no audit
of how your household uses the grant.</p>

<p>The grant is payable even if the household is not a customer of Irish Water
(that is, it has its own private water supply or is part of a group scheme and
also it has its own sewage treatment system). It will not be paid for second
homes or holiday homes. If you are a tenant, you will be paid the grant (if you
registered by 30 June 2015) not your landlord.</p>

<p>The grant is administered and paid by the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/">Department of Social Protection</a>, on behalf of
the <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/">Department of the Environment,
Community and Local Government</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Applications for the Water Conservation Grant 2015 are now
closed.</strong> </p>

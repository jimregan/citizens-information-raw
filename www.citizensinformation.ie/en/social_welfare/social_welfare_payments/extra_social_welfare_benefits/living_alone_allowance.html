<h3>Living Alone</h3>

<p>To get the increase in your payment you must live completely alone. However,
there are some exceptions:</p>

<p>If you are living in an extension of a family member's home, for example, in
a granny flat, you can qualify for the increase if you can show that you have
facilities to cook and eat alone. You must also have your own living/dining and
sleeping accommodation. </p>

<p>You may also qualify as living alone if you are aged or infirm and have a
friend or relative to stay for security reasons at night-time only. The friend
or relative must not contribute to the household financially. </p>

<p>The increase may also be payable if you live alone during the day but stay
with relatives or friends at night or if you live alone during the week but
have a relative to stay at the weekend (the living alone condition is satisfied
as long as the relative has a permanent home address elsewhere).</p>

<p>You will also qualify if you live alone but <span>occasionally</span> take
in paying guests (for example, during a local festival). However, if you run a
bed and breakfast business (even for part of the year) you will not qualify.
</p>

<p>People who live in sheltered accommodation <span>may</span> qualify if they
are regarded as living independently within the institution. The Department of
Social Protection provides a <a shape="rect" href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/811_Living-Alone-Increase.aspx#list">list
of hostels/homes where Living Alone Increase is payable.</a> You will
<strong>not </strong>qualify if you share dormitory accommodation with others,
or have supervision or nursing care round-the clock. </p>

<p>People who live in nursing homes will <strong>not</strong> qualify as they
cannot be regarded as living <span>completely</span> or <span>mainly</span>
alone. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Short-Term Enterprise Allowance (STEA) gives support to people who have
lost their job and want to start their own business.</p>

<p>To qualify you must be getting Jobseeker’s Benefit. There is no qualifying
period, which means you do not need to have been getting Jobseeker’s Benefit
for a certain period of time. However, you will not qualify if you are getting
Jobseeker’s Benefit and working part-time.</p>

<p>The Short-Term Enterprise Allowance is paid instead of your Jobseeker’s
Benefit for a maximum of 9 months. It ends when your entitlement to Jobseeker's
Benefit ends (that is at either 9 or 6 months). </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>To qualify for the Short-Term Enterprise Allowance you must be getting or
have an entitlement to <a href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker’s
Benefit</a>. </p>

<p>Your business plan must be approved in advance in writing by a Case Officer
based in an Intreo Centre or a social welfare local office or an Enterprise
Officer in your local development company (also known as partnership company)
(see 'How to apply' below). </p>

<p>Seasonal, temporary or part time self-employment does not qualify for the
STEA.</p>

<p>You must contact the Department of Social Protection immediately if your
self-employment ends or you take up employment.</p>

<p>If you are unemployed when your entitlement to STEA ends you will not
immediately re-qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit. However, you can apply for <a href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s
Allowance</a>, which is a means-tested payment.</p>

<h3>Employment grants</h3>

<p>Employment grants from a Local Enterprise Office (LEO) or a local
development company do not affect your entitlement to the Short-Term Enterprise
Allowance.</p>

<h3>Help with starting a business</h3>

<p>In addition to income support (your weekly payment), you can also get
financial support with the costs of setting up your business. These supports
are provided under a scheme called the Enterprise Support Grant (ESG). (The ESG
replaced the Technical Assistance and Training Scheme.)</p>

<p>You can only get the ESG if you have been approved for either the Back to
Work Enterprise Allowance or the Short-Term Enterprise Allowance. The business
plan you submit as part of your application for the scheme must set out the
rationale and requirement for financial support. The ESG is paid to people
getting the STEA on a pro-rata basis - a maximum of €937 can be paid to
people on a 9-month STEA and a maximum of €625 to people on a 6-month STEA.
You must be able to make a matching contribution of at least 20% to access
grant support. You need to provide documentary evidence of the costs
(quotations from at least 2 suppliers or, if a single supplier, the reasons for
choosing a single supplier). </p>

<p>Eligible items for grant support include:</p>

</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>If you qualify, the Short-Term Enterprise Allowance replaces your
Jobseeker’s Benefit. The STEA will be paid at the same rate as your
Jobseeker’s Benefit, including any increases for adult and child dependants.
It ends when your entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit ends. The STEA may be paid
directly into your bank or building society account on a weekly basis. It
cannot be paid into a mortgage account.</p>

<p>You do not pay PRSI or Universal Social Charge on the STEA. However the STEA
is subject to <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">income
tax</a> in the same way as Jobseeker’s Benefit. (Note that this is different
from the <a href="back_to_work_enterprise_allowance.html">Back to Work
Enterprise Allowance</a> which is not taxable). You may qualify for <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/start_your_own_business_scheme.html">Start
Your Own Business Relief</a> which provides a two-year exemption from income
tax (up to a maximum of €40,000 each year) for people who have been
unemployed for at least 12 months before starting their own business. It runs
from 25 October 2013 to 31 December 2018. (However if you started to get the
STEA before 25 October 2013 you do not qualify for the relief because you had
already started your business before the start date for the scheme.)</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Extra benefits</h3>

<p>You can keep any extra (or <em>secondary</em> benefits) that you were
getting with your Jobseeker’s Benefit provided you continue to satisfy the
conditions. For example, <a href="../../../health/entitlement_to_health_services/medical_card.html">a
medical card</a> and <a href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/back_to_school_clothing_and_footwear_allowance.html">Back
to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance</a>.</p>

<p>However you must be deemed eligible for the <a href="../../../housing/local_authority_and_social_housing/rental_accommodation_scheme.html">Rental
Accomodation Scheme</a> to keep your Rent Supplement and an increase in your
income may affect your Rent Supplement. To find out how your <a href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a> may be affected contact the <a href="../../../health/how_health_is_organised/health_boards_and_community_welfare_officers.html">Department
of Social Protection's representative (formerly known as the Community Welfare
Officer</a>) in your local <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/otheroffice/community-welfare-office-contact.aspx">health
centre</a>.</p>

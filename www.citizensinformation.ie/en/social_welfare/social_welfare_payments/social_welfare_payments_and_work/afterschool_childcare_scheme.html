<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The After-School Child Care Scheme (ASCC) supports low-income people to
return to work. The scheme provides subsidised after-school childcare places to
people with children of primary school age who find employment, increase their
employment or take up a place on an employment support scheme.</p>

<p>The subsidised after-school childcare places are provided by local childcare
providers (both community and commercial). You pay your contribution directly
to the childcare provider.</p>

<p>The Department of Social Protection has published <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/After-school-Child-Care-Scheme---SW-135.aspx">an
information leaflet on the scheme - SW135.</a></p>

<p>Since 25 June 2015 people getting Family Income Supplement (FIS) who
increase the hours they work can apply for the scheme.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You may be eligible for the scheme if you:</p>
<ul><li>Have 1 or more children aged between 4 and 13 who are in primary school
    and</li>
  <li>Are currently getting either <a href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s
    Allowance</a>, <a href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker’s
    Benefit</a>, <a href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance_transition.html">Jobseeker's
    Transitional payment</a>, <a href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent
    Family Payment</a> or are on an <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/schemes_to_support_employment.html">employment
    support programme</a> and have been getting your payment (or a combination
    of any of the qualifying payments) for at least 3 months</li>
  <li>Or have been getting <a href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
    Income Supplement (FIS)</a> (for any length of time) and increase your
    hours of work</li>
</ul><p>To avail of the scheme you must either:</p>
<ul><li>Start a new job (including a job under the <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/jobsplus.html">JobsPlus</a>
    initiative) or</li>
  <li>Increase the number of hours you currently work or</li>
  <li>Take up a place on an employment support programme (<a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/community_employment_scheme.html">except
    the Community Employment scheme</a>)</li>
</ul><h3>People who are not eligible</h3>

<p>If you are on a Community Employment (CE) scheme you are not eligible for
the ASCC as the CE Childcare Programme caters for people on CE schemes with
children up to 13 years of age.) Self-employed people who are getting
Jobseeker’s Allowance and people who are <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">signing
for credits</a> only are not eligible for the scheme.</p>

<h3>Childcare places</h3>

<p>If you are allocated an after-school child care place(s), you are entitled
to a total of 52 weeks of after-school child care (regardless of the number of
children you have) provided your circumstances do not change.</p>

<p>If you use the service part-time in a week, this is counts as a full week.
In other words, you are entitled to a maximum of 52 weeks on the scheme, even
if you only use the scheme part-time.</p>

<p>Provided that your circumstances do not change, your entitlement will last
for 52 weeks from the date that you first take up an after-school child care
place. Your childcare provider will notify you when the end of your eligibility
period is approaching (see ‘Other options’ below for other childcare
schemes you may be able to avail of).</p>

<p>If you lose your job you will no longer be eligible for the scheme. However,
if you get your job back or find a new job, you may be entitled to use any
weeks remaining from your 52-week provision if you are still eligible.</p>

<p>You can apply for subsidised after-school child care up to 26 weeks after
you start your new job, take up additional employment or start your employment
support scheme. </p>

<h3>Changes to your situation</h3>

<p>If you are offered subsidised after-school child care, you must immediately
notify your local Intreo centre or social welfare office of any change in your
circumstances that may affect your entitlement. For example, you may no longer
be entitled to the scheme if:</p>
<ul><li>You lose your job</li>
  <li>You reduce your hours of employment </li>
  <li>You leave your employment programme</li>
  <li>Your child is no longer of primary school age</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>If you meet the criteria and are offered a place on the scheme, you can get
after-school child care at a subsidised daily rate of €3 per day per child
(€15 per week), which you pay directly to the childcare provider.</p>

<p>The scheme also offers a pick-up service at no additional cost.</p>

<p>The amount you pay will not vary during school holidays. If you need
full-time child care during holidays, the additional cost will be funded by the
scheme for up to 10 weeks. However you cannot use the childcare scheme only for
holiday periods, you must use the scheme during the school year to be eligible
for school holiday child care.</p>

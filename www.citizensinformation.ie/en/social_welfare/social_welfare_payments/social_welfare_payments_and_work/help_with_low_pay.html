<h3>Family Income Supplement </h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
Income Supplement</a> is a weekly tax-free payment that gives help to those on
low pay. It is available to employees with children. </p>

<h3>Getting social welfare payments</h3>

<p>In certain circumstances, you are allowed to keep social welfare payments
(or at least part of them) when you start work. For example:</p>

<p>If you work part-time up to 3 days per week you may be entitled to retain
part of your <a shape="rect" href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker's Benefit</a> or
<a shape="rect" href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
Allowance</a>. If you are getting <a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent
Family Payment</a> you are allowed to earn a certain amount each week and keep
your payment. If you are getting a means-tested disability payment, such as
Disability Allowance or Blind Pension, you may earn a certain amount from <a href="disability_payments_and_work.html">rehabilitative work</a> without it
affecting your payment. If you are getting Illness Benefit (for at least 6
months) or Invalidity Pension you can apply for <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/partial_capacity_benefit.html">Partial
Capacity Benefit</a> and keep part of your payment, depending on how restricted
your capacity for work is.</p>

<h4><span>Back to Work Enterprise Allowance</span></h4>

<p>Under this scheme you can become self-employed and keep a certain amount of
your social welfare payment. Find out more about the <a shape="rect" href="back_to_work_enterprise_allowance.html">Back to Enterprise Work
Allowance</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Retaining Rent Supplement</strong><br>
From 5 June 2007 if you have been unemployed or not in full-time employment for
at least 12 months and are assessed as in need of housing under the <a shape="rect" href="../../../../housing/local_authority_and_social_housing/rental_accommodation_scheme.html">Rental
Accommodation Scheme</a> you may be entitled to retain your <a shape="rect" href="../../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement.</a> </p>

<h3>Retaining medical card</h3>

<p>If you are unemployed and you are returning to full-time or part-time work,
you can keep your medical card for 3 years provided you have been getting one
of the following for 12 months or more:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="../../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker's
    Benefit</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
    Allowance</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent
    Family Payment</a> </li>
  <li><a href="../disability_and_illness/disablement_benefit.html">Illness
    Benefit</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability
    Allowance</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/blind_persons_pension.html">Blind
    Pension</a> or </li>
  <li>Have been on an employment incentive scheme or educational opportunity
    scheme </li>
</ul><p>If you take up full-time employment you will retain your medical card for 3
years from the date you start work. If you take up part-time employment the
three-year period starts from the date your income exceeds the relevant medical
card guideline. </p>

<h3>Tax and PRSI</h3>

<p>If you are on low pay you may not be liable to pay any tax because your <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/introduction_to_income_tax_credits_and_reliefs.html">tax
credits and reliefs</a> are more than or equal to the amount of tax you are due
to pay. People with an income below €10,036 do not pay the <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">Universal
Social Charge (USC)</a>. </p>

<p>People aged 65 and over are subject to the same general tax rules as
everyone else but they do get tax exemption limits below which they pay no tax
and some extra tax credits. Revenue's information leaflet <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it8.pdf">Tax Exemption and
Marginal Relief (IT 8) (pdf)</a> gives information on available exemption
limits and tax relief. </p>

<p>If you have overpaid income tax or Universal Social Charge, then you can <a shape="rect" href="/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/tax_refund_when_unemployed_or_out_of_work_sick.html">claim
a tax refund</a>. Further information about tax is also available from <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/cont_main.htm">your nearest tax
office</a>. </p>

<p>If you earn between €38 and €352 you do not have to pay <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">PRSI</a>.
However, your employer pays PRSI. More information can be found in our document
about your <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/employer_s_duty_to_pay_social_insurance_prsi.html">employer's
duty to pay social insurance</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Part-Time Job Incentive (PTJI) Scheme allows certain people getting
Jobseeker’s Allowance (JA) to take up part-time work and get a special weekly
allowance instead of their jobseeker’s payment. It is intended to be a
stepping stone to full-time work. You must be available for and seeking
full-time work while you are on the Part-Time Job Incentive Scheme.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You can participate in the PTJI Scheme if you get part-time work for less
than 24 hours per week and immediately before that you were:</p>
<ul><li>On long-term <a href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker’s
    Allowance (JA)</a> for at least 390 days (15 months). Days of unemployment
    on Jobseeker's Benefit (JB) count towards the 390 days if you were getting
    JB immediately before you got Jobseeker’s Allowance.</li>
  <li>Getting a weekly JA payment of at least €122.20 if you are single or
    €199.20 if you are getting an increase for a qualified adult.</li>
</ul><p>People who were getting <a href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent
Family Payment</a> and have moved to Jobseeker’s Allowance because their <a href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/transition_from_ofp.html">youngest
child has reached the age limit</a> can take part in the PTJI scheme. This
applies to people who had been working part-time while on OFP or who take up
part-time work. You may be entitled to <a href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
Income Supplement</a> instead of PTJI but if you are working fewer than 38
hours per fortnight (19 hours per week) the PTJI scheme may be an option for
you. You can get information and advice on all your options from your local
Intreo Centre or Citizens Information Centre. </p>

<p>You must also undertake to remain on the scheme for 2 months. You can do
more than one part-time job but the total hours worked must be less than 24.
The part-time job you get must be likely to last at least 2 months and be
insurable at <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_classes.html">PRSI
Class A or J</a>. If you get full-time work you may not return to the PTJI
Scheme at the end of your full-time work no matter how short it was.
Self-employed people are not eligible for this scheme.</p>

<h3>Duration of payment</h3>

<p>Initially, you can stay on the PTJI scheme for one year. This may be
extended for a further period. While on the scheme, you must continue to look
for full-time work.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Instead of your usual payment, you will get a weekly allowance of:</p>
<ul><li>€122.20 per week if you are single</li>
  <li>€199.20 per week if you are getting an increase for a qualified
  adult</li>
</ul><p>There are no increases in these rates for qualified children. The allowance
is paid regardless of how much you earn in your job. However, your wages will
be taxable in the usual way. If you have children and work over 19 hours a week
(or 38 hours a fortnight) you can also apply for <a href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
Income Supplement</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>Once you have secured the part-time job, you should contact your <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Intreo-Centres-and-Local-and-Branch-Offices.aspx">Intreo
Centre or local Social Welfare Branch Office</a> to apply for the PTJI scheme.
You will be asked to complete the application form PTA 1 and give details of
your part-time employment.</p>

<p>Your employer has to complete form PTJI2 at the end of each 4-week period to
confirm the hours that you worked and that you are insurably employed. You must
sign a declaration (using the same form) confirming that you worked less than
24 hours each week. You must return this form to your Intreo Centre or Social
Welfare Branch Office. If there is any delay in returning this form, payment is
suspended until the form is received. Payment is made weekly by EFT.</p>

<p>If your job ends or you finish the PTJI you may re-qualify for long-term
Jobseeker’s Allowance as long as there is no change in your circumstances
(other than finishing the part-time job). Alternatively, you may qualify for
Jobseeker’s Benefit if you have enough PRSI contributions.</p>

<h3>Secondary benefits</h3>

<p>No secondary benefits are paid while you are on the Part-Time Job Incentive
scheme. You can keep your medical card while you are on the PTJI scheme
regardless of your earnings for a maximum of 3 years. You can continue to
qualify for <a href="../supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a> but your earnings will be assessed against your supplement.</p>

<h3>Appeals</h3>

<p>The Part-Time Job Incentive scheme is a non-statutory scheme and you cannot
appeal a decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. If you are not happy
with a decision on the scheme you can appeal to the Officer in charge of the
Part-Time Job Incentive Scheme at your social welfare local office.</p>

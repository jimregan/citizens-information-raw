<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Back to Work Allowance Scheme encourages unemployed people (among
others) to take up employment. The Scheme is aimed at people getting a social
welfare payment for a certain period of time. </p>

<p><strong>The Back to Work Allowance scheme is closed to new applicants from 1
May 2009.</strong></p>

<p>People participating in this scheme keep a percentage of their social
welfare payment along with <em>secondary benefits</em> for a period of up to 3
years. The percentage of your payment you keep is called the Back to Work
Allowance. The Back to Work Allowance part of your income is not subject to
taxation or <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">social
insurance</a> (PRSI). Your employer may also qualify for the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Publications/SW73">Employers PRSI Exemption
Scheme</a> (closed from 1 May 2009).<br></p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Conditions you must meet</h3>

<p>To qualify for the Back to Work Allowance, you must: </p>
<ul><li>Be age 23 or over </li>
  <li>Have been unemployed for 2 years </li>
</ul><p><strong>And </strong></p>
<ul><li>Have an entitlement to Jobseeker's Allowance. </li>
</ul><p>You may also qualify, no matter what age you are, if you are getting one of
the following payments for 15 months (or 12 months if you are aged 50 or over):
</p>
<ul><li>You have been getting Farm Assist, Pre-Retirement Allowance, One-Parent
    Family Payment, Blind Pension, Disability Allowance, Carer's Allowance (if
    you are no longer a carer), Invalidity Pension, Deserted Wife's Benefit or
    Allowance, Prisoner's Wife's Allowance, Incapacity Supplement, Widow's,
    Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Non-Contributory) Pension or
    Prisoner's Wife's Allowance. You don't have to be any specific age to
    qualify in these cases. </li>
</ul><p><strong>Or</strong></p>
<ul><li>You have been getting Illness Benefit for at least 3 years. </li>
</ul><p>Time spent on FÁS, Failte Ireland, Teagasc, FIT, Community Employment, Job
Initiative, 'second chance education courses' (i.e., Back to Education Schemes)
and/or time spent in prison are accepted as periods of unemployment. </p>

<p>Also, time spent on Supplementary Welfare Allowance or in Direct Provision
can count towards the qualifying period for Back to Work Allowance provided you
are entitled to a qualifying payment before starting on the scheme.</p>

<h3>Conditions your prospective employer must meet</h3>

<p>Only employers who can provide suitable jobs are eligible to participate.
The work being offered must:</p>
<ul><li>Be likely to develop into a lasting job </li>
  <li>Not displace existing employment </li>
  <li>Be a minimum of 20 hours per week </li>
  <li>Be for at least 12 months. </li>
</ul><p>Short-term, seasonal or commissioned/contractual work is not acceptable as
employment under the Scheme.</p>

<h3>Spouse, civil partner or cohabitant swap</h3>

<p>If you qualify for the Back to Work Allowance Scheme but do not wish to
avail of the scheme your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant may participate
instead. You must be getting an <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/claiming_an_increase_in_your_social_welfare_payment_for_an_adult_dependant.html">increase
in your social welfare payment for your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant</a>
for a specific amount of time. It is usually the same amount of time that you
would need to be claiming your payment to qualify for the scheme. For example,
if you are getting: </p>
<ul><li>Jobseeker's Allowance (JA) a spouse/civil partner or cohabitant must be a
    qualified adult dependent for 2 years </li>
  <li>Illness Benefit a spouse, civil partner or cohabitant must be a qualified
    adult dependent for 3 years </li>
  <li>Disability Allowance, Blind Pension, Carer's Allowance (on ceasing caring
    duties), Farm Assist, Invalidity Pension, Incapacity Supplement or
    Pre-Retirement Allowance a spouse/civil partner or cohabitant must be a
    qualified adult dependant for at least 15 months (or 12 months if aged over
    50). </li>
</ul><p>In the case of Jobseeker’s Allowance, when your spouse, civil partner or
cohabitant starts on the scheme a separate claim will be set up in their name.
When your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant starts on the scheme your JA
payment will stop. However, your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant can now
claim for you as a qualified adult. <strong>You</strong> should sign for
credits at your local social welfare office. It is important to sign on for
credits to protect any future pension entitlements you may have. This new
arrangement should not affect the amount of social welfare payment you get as a
family.</p>

<p>If you (the original owner of the social welfare payment) decide to claim
another social welfare payment at any time while your spouse, civil partner or
cohabitant is availing of this swap the payment of Back to Work Allowance will
stop. <br></p>

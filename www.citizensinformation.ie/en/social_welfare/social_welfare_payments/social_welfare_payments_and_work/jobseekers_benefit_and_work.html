<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>One of the primary conditions for getting Jobseeker’s Benefit is that you
must be unemployed. However, you do not have to be totally unemployed – you
must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of the 7-day social welfare
employment week. </p>

<p>You must also be available for and actively seeking work and you must meet
all the other <a shape="rect" href="../unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">conditions for
Jobseeker’s Benefit</a>. For example, you must have enough social insurance
(PRSI) contributions.</p>

<p>You can work and get Jobseeker’s Benefit if:</p>
<ol><li>Your days at work are reduced due to lack of work (systematic short-time
    working) </li>
  <li>You are a part-time worker including job-sharing week on and week off
    (but not if you have chosen to do so) </li>
  <li>You get casual work or part-time work </li>
  <li>You have <em>subsidiary employment </em></li>
</ol><p>This document also looks at how taking up temporary work affects your
Jobseeker’s Benefit.</p>

<p>Jobseeker’s Benefit is taxable in addition to any income from work.
However, it is not taxable if you are getting it because your hours at work are
temporarily reduced (systematic short-time working). Find out more about <a shape="rect" href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">taxation

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l45839">How work is assessed for Jobseeker's
Benefit</h2>

<h3>1. If your days at work are reduced (temporarily) - systematic
short-time</h3>

<p>If you normally work full-time but short-time working is introduced by your
employer you may get Jobseeker’s Benefit (JB). Reduced working hours on a
temporary basis is called <em>systematic short-time working</em>. You will get
JB for the days you don't work provided you meet the other conditions that
apply to JB, for example, you cannot work more than 3 days per week. If you
work 4 days you are no longer entitled to claim JB (because you must be
unemployed for 4 out of 7 days). </p>

<p>For systematic short-time workers the social welfare week is based on 5
days. This means that days worked and days of unemployment added together
cannot be more than 5. For example, if your days of work are reduced to 3 days
per week, you will get JB for the other 2 days and you will use up 2 days of
your total JB entitlement. This means you will get 2/5ths of the normal amount
of Jobseeker's Benefit (see table below). In these circumstances if you are
entitled to 234 days JB (9 months) you could, in theory, continue to claim JB
for 117 weeks. However the Department of Social Protection (DSP) will reassess
a systematic short time worker’s JB claim if it goes on for an extended
period. If DSP decide that it is unlikely you will return to full-time work
with that company in the short term, you will be reassessed as a part-time
worker.</p>

<p>You can read a case study showing you <a href="../../../reference/case_studies/case_study_jobseekers_benefit_and_systematic_short_time_work.html">how
to calculate the length of time a systematic short time worker can get
Jobseeker's Benefit</a>. </p>

<p>You will continue to pay PRSI in the normal way. However, Jobseeker’s
Benefit is <strong>not taxable</strong> if you are a systematic short-time
worker.</p>

be unemployed for 4 out of 7 days). </p>

<p>If you are a part-time worker and your days of work are reduced temporarily
you are not treated as a systematic short-time worker - you are treated as a
part-time worker (see below). For example, if your working pattern is reduced
from 3 days (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday) to 2 days (Monday and Tuesday) per
week, you will be paid Jobseeker's Benefit for 3 days once you satisfy all the
conditions. </p>

<p>An employer may initially reduce your work days on a temporary basis, but if
there is no prospect of returning to full-time work with that employer you will
be reassessed as a part-time worker.</p>

<h3>2. Part-time workers</h3>

<p>Where a Jobseeker's Benefit recipient is working for part of a week, the
amount of JB they are paid is based on a 5-day week. This means that for each
day that a person is employed, 1/5th of the normal rate of Jobseeker's Benefit
is deducted from their payment. If they get part-time work for 2 days, they
will get 3/5ths of the normal Jobseeker's Benefit for that week and if they get
part-time work for 3 days they will get 2/5ths of the normal rate of
Jobseeker’s Benefit for the week (see table below).</p>

<p>You must still be unemployed for 4 days out of 7 to claim Jobseeker's
Benefit. The Department of Social Protection has published <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Schemes/JobseekerSupports/JobseekersBenefit/Pages/JobseekersbenefitFivedaypaymentweek_FAQ.aspx">FAQS
about the changes</a>.</p>

<p>Part-time workers must continue to look for full-time employment. Your
Jobseeker's Benefit <strong>is</strong> taxable if you are working part time.
You must claim Jobseeker's Benefit for at least 3 days in any week. If you get
4 days work, Jobseeker's Benefit is not paid at all.</p>

    </tr></tbody></table><p>If you work 4 days you are no longer entitled to claim JB (because you must
be unemployed for 4 out of 7 days). </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Jobseeker’s Benefit is paid for 234 days or 156
days depending on how many PRSI contributions you have paid. You are considered
to be unemployed for 6 days out of the 7-day social welfare employment week. If
you are fully unemployed you would use up your entitlement to Jobseeker’s
Benefit after either 9 months (6 days of unemployment per week x 39 equals 234
days) or 6 months (6 days of unemployment per week x 26 equals 156 days).
However if you are working part time your entitlement to Jobseeker’s Benefit
may last longer. For example if you are entitled to 234 days JB (39 weeks) and
you are working for 2 days a week and unemployed for the remaining 4 days you
could continue to claim Jobseeker’s Benefit for 58.5 weeks. If you were
working for 3 days a week you would use 3 days of your total JB entitlement and
you could continue to claim JB for 78 weeks. </p>

<h3>Job-sharing and week on/off</h3>

<p>If you have been working full-time and then enter a job-sharing arrangement,
you are not eligible for Jobseeker's Benefit because you have voluntarily opted
to work fewer hours or days.</p>

<p>If you are working week on or off, your entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit
will depend on whether you are available for work on the week off. </p>

<p>In these types of situations, you need to be careful to ensure that <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/part_time_work_and_social_insurance_prsi.html">you
have a full PRSI record</a>. Depending on your precise working arrangements,
you could end up with only 26 paid contributions. However, if you are getting
Jobseeker's Benefit, you will get a PRSI credit for the week you are not
working. </p>

<h3>3. Casual work or part-time work</h3>

<p>You may get Jobseeker’s Benefit if you can only get part-time or casual
work. You must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of a period of 7
consecutive days and continue to look for full-time employment. </p>

<p>For each day you are employed, 1/5th of the normal rate of Jobseeker's
Benefit is deducted from your weekly payment, provided that you are unemployed
for at least 4 days out of a period of 7 consecutive days. For example, if you
get casual work for 2 days, you can get 3/5ths of the normal Jobseeker's
Benefit for that week. </p>

<p>You must claim Jobseeker's Benefit for at least 3 days in any week. If you
get 4 days work, Jobseeker's Benefit is <strong>not</strong> paid at all. </p>

<p>Normally you cannot get Jobseeker's Benefit for a day on which you do casual
or part-time work, unless, it comes within the subsidiary work rules (see
below).</p>

<h3>4. Subsidiary employment</h3>

<p>As a general rule, you will not get Jobseeker's Benefit for any day you are
employed or self-employed. However, it is possible to do some subsidiary work
and still get Jobseeker's Benefit for the day in question. </p>

<p>Subsidiary work is work that could have been done while you were in
full-time employment and outside your normal working hours. For example, you
may work a full-time job during the day and have a part-time job in the
evening. The part-time job is known as subsidiary or secondary employment if
you were able to do the part-time work without it affecting your full-time job
for a period of at least 6 months.</p>

<p>If you have subsidiary employment, you should always check with the
Department of Social Protection (DSP) to see whether or not your Jobseeker's
Benefit will be affected. </p>

<p>If you have less than 117 paid PRSI contributions in the three years before
becoming unemployed, you may not earn more than €12.70 a day from subsidiary
employment. There is no earnings limit if you have more than 117 paid PRSI
contributions. </p>

<p>If you are a farmer with other full-time employment, your farming will be
your subsidiary employment.</p>

<h3>Sunday work and jobseeker's payments</h3>

<p><strong>Since 21 February 2013 Sunday working is taken into account for
Jobseeker's Benefit.</strong> You must be unemployed for 4 out of 7 consecutive
days (including Sunday). If you work on Sunday you are considered to be
employed for 1 day and 1/5th of your normal rate of Jobseeker's Benefit will be
deducted from your weekly payment.</p>

<p>Even though the social welfare employment week now takes Sunday into account
you are not considered unemployed for 7 days. You are considered to be
unemployed for 6 days out of the 7-day social welfare employment week. This
means that for each week that you are fully unemployed 6 days are deducted from
the days remaining on your Jobseeker's Benefit claim. </p>

<p>In the same way a person who works 2 days a week would have 4 days deducted
from the days remaining on their JB claim.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Public holidays</h3>

<p>Your employer must pay you for the public holidays which you don’t work as
long as you have worked at least 40 hours in the 5 weeks immediately before the
week of the public holiday. You can find more information in our document on <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/public_holidays_in_ireland.html">public
holidays</a>.</p>

<p>If you work and get Jobseeker's Benefit, you get a daily rate of Jobseeker's
Benefit for the days that you don't work. You will not get Jobseeker’s
Benefit for the day you receive payment from your employer for a public holiday
but you can continue to get Jobseeker’s Benefit for the other days you do not
work.</p>

<h3>Temporary work</h3>

<p>If you are getting Jobseeker's Benefit and are offered temporary work for at
least 4 days each week your Jobseeker's Benefit will stop. If you are
unemployed for a second time within 26 weeks your application for Jobseeker's
Benefit is not treated as a new claim. </p>

<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" border="1" width="678" summary=""><thead><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>Example</strong></td>
    </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Susan is unemployed and has been getting
        Jobseeker's Benefit for 8 months. She has 260 paid PRSI contributions,
        which means she can get Jobseeker's Benefit for a maximum of 9 months.
        She was offered 2 months temporary work in a factory. When her 2-months
        work ends she is entitled to claim Jobseeker's Benefit for another
        month.</p>
      </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>However, if you have used up your entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit, you
may re-qualify by working and paying the appropriate PRSI contributions for at
least 13 weeks. </p>

<h4>Short-term employment or training</h4>

<p>The Department of Social Protection also operates a fast-tracking system for
customers who sign off for a short period of up to 12 weeks to take up work or
to go on a training course. This ensures that payment is re-instated without
delay. It is important that you inform your local office in advance that you
are taking up work or training.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title">Civil partner, spouse or cohabitant working
and Jobseeker’s Benefit</h2>

<p>Your Jobseeker's Benefit is not affected by your spouse’s, civil
partner’s or cohabitant's income. However their income can affect whether you
get an increase in your Jobseeker's Benefit payment for him or her as a
qualified adult. The increase in your payment for an adult dependant is called
an Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA). If your adult dependant is earning
€100 or less you will get the maximum IQA. If he or she is earning between
€100 and €310 you will get a reduced rate of IQA. If your adult dependant
is earning more than €310 you will not get an IQA for your adult
dependant.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>How your spouse’s, civil partner’s or cohabitant's income is assessed
</h3>

<p>Your spouse’s, civil partner’s or cohabitant's income from all sources
is added together to find out if you qualify for an increase in your
Jobseeker’s Benefit.</p>

<h3>Income from work</h3>

<p><strong>Employment: </strong>Your spouse’s, civil partner’s or
cohabitant's average weekly income from employment is assessed. The gross
weekly income is assessed and no deductions are allowed for tax, PRSI
contributions or personal expenses. If your spouse's, civil partner's or
cohabitant's income is paid monthly, the weekly average over the previous two
months is calculated. If he or she is paid weekly or fortnightly, the weekly
average over the previous 6 weeks is used. Note that your partner can get <a shape="rect" href="../social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/family_income_supplement.html">Family
Income Supplement (FIS)</a> while you are getting Jobseeker's Benefit. </p>

<p><strong>Self-employment: </strong>To calculate earnings from self-employment
the income received in the last completed tax year is divided by 52 to get the
average weekly income. Earnings are assessed as gross income less allowable
expenses over 12 months. Annual earnings from self-employment are divided by 52
to find your weekly means from self-employment. Any ‘drawings’ you take
from the business is not an allowable expense.</p>

<h3>Income from capital </h3>

<p>Income from capital, for example, property, savings and investments, is
included in the mean test. Where capital is held jointly, half of the value is
assessed as belonging to your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant. You can find
out more about how <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/how_to_assess_your_means_from_capital_for_social_welfare_payments.html">capital
is assessed in the means test. </a></p>

<p></p>

<h3>Income from other sources</h3>

<p>Income from other sources includes rental income from the letting of
property, income from an occupational pension, foreign social welfare payments,
income from a trust fund, income under a deed of covenant and other cash
income. It is calculated on a weekly basis.</p>

<p>The following social welfare payments are not taken into account as
income:</p>
<ul><li>Disablement Benefit </li>
  <li>Occupational Injuries Death Benefit in respect of an Orphan </li>
  <li>Guardian's Payment (Contributory) </li>
  <li>Guardian's Payment (Non-Contributory) </li>
  <li>Child Benefit </li>
  <li>Domiciliary Care Allowance </li>
  <li>Supplementary Welfare Allowance </li>

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Voluntary work is a good way to keep active, learn new skills and get
involved in your local community. You may do some unpaid work as a volunteer
and keep your social welfare payment. However, you must continue to meet all
the conditions attached to your payment. </p>

<p>Your Intreo centre or social welfare local office or the section paying your
social welfare payment will usually decide whether you can keep your social
welfare payment and work as a volunteer.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l8fdad">Disability payments</h2>

<p>Usually, you get a disability payment because you cannot work. If you are
getting Disability Allowance, Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension you must
get permission to work as a volunteer. You must apply to the section that pays
your social welfare payment <strong>before</strong> starting any voluntary
work. </p>

<p>You can work as a volunteer while you are getting Invalidity Pension or
Illness Benefit and it is not necessary to apply for the <a href="disability_and_illness/partial_capacity_benefit.html">Partial Capacity
Scheme</a>.</p>

<p>If you are getting <a shape="rect" href="disability_and_illness/invalidity_pension.html">Invalidity Pension</a>
you cannot do more than 19.5 hours of voluntary work per week. If you are
getting <a shape="rect" href="disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">Illness Benefit</a> or <a shape="rect" href="disability_and_illness/disability_allowance.html">Disability
Allowance</a>, there is no limit on the number of hours per week you can work
unpaid as a volunteer. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l52655">Carer’s payments</h2>

<p>To qualify for a carer’s payment you must be providing full-time care. If
you are getting Carer’s Allowance or Carer’s Benefit, you can do a maximum
of 15 hours per week of voluntary work. Before you start working as a
volunteer, you must get permission from the <a shape="rect" href="carers/carers_allowance.html">Carer’s Allowance</a> or <a shape="rect" href="carers/carers_benefit.html">Carer’s Benefit</a> section in the
Department of Social Protection.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l39700">Jobseeker’s payments</h2>

<p>To get <a shape="rect" href="unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's Allowance</a> or
<a shape="rect" href="unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker's
Benefit</a> you must be available and looking for work. If you want to do
voluntary work, you must first get permission from a Deciding Officer at your
Intreo centre or social welfare local office. You must continue to satisfy the
<a href="unemployed_people/conditions_for_getting_a_jobseekers_payment.html">conditions
of your jobseeker’s payment</a>. </p>

<p>A number of factors are taken into account by a Deciding Officer in
determining whether the work involved is voluntary, these include:</p>
<ul><li>The aims and standing of the voluntary organisation (they can be national
    or local voluntary groups) </li>
  <li>The type of work involved </li>
  <li>The weekly number of hours worked. </li>
</ul><p>Examples of unpaid voluntary work a jobseeker may do include assisting youth
clubs, care groups, sports groups, and local residents associations.</p>

<p>If you want to do voluntary work and continue to get Jobseeker’s Allowance
or Jobseeker’s Benefit, you must apply under the voluntary work option before
you start any voluntary work. To apply, fill in application form (VW1), which
is available from your <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Intreo-Centres-and-Local-and-Branch-Offices.aspx">Intreo
centre or social welfare local office</a>.</p>

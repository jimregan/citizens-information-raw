<p>Deserted Wife's Benefit and <a href="deserted_wifes_allowance.html">Deserted Wife’s Allowance</a> are two
social welfare payments made to women who were deserted by their husbands. Both
of these payments were closed to new applications in January 1997, when the <a shape="rect" href="one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent Family
Payment</a> was introduced. Some women have continued to get Deserted Wife’s
Benefit because they qualified for the payment before 2 January 1997 and have
continued to meet the qualifying criteria. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p><strong>Deserted Wife's Benefit</strong> is a payment made to a woman
deserted by her husband. Entitlement to the payment is based on social
insurance contributions paid by the woman or her husband. </p>

<p>If you have transfered from Deserted Wife’s Benefit to One-Parent Family
Payment to be accepted as a participant on a Community Employment Scheme, you
can apply to have your entitlement to Deserted Wife's Benefit restored. The
maximum weekly rate of payment for Deserted Wife’s Benefit is higher than the
maximum weekly rate of One-Parent Family Payment. If you qualify to have your
entitlement to Deserted Wife’s Benefit restored you may also be due
arrears.</p>

<p>Women getting Deserted Wife’s Benefit can apply for and transfer to the <a shape="rect" href="../older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html">State
Pension (Contributory)</a> when they reach 66.</p>

<p>If you are currently getting a reduced rate of Deserted Wife's Benefit, but
have been working, then you may qualify for a higher rate of <a href="../older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html">State
Pension (Contributory)</a>, based on your own PRSI contributions, when you
reach 66. However if you do not qualify for the State Pension (Contributory)
when you reach 66 you will automatically get a higher rate of Deserted Wife's
Benefit (see 'Rates' below).</p>

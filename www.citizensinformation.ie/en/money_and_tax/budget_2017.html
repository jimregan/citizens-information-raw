<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l01933">Taxation</h2>

<h3>Income tax</h3>

<p>The <a href="tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/home_carers_tax_credit.html">Home
Carer's Tax Credit</a> that is given to married couples or civil partners where
one spouse or civil partner works in the home caring for a dependent person is
increasing from €1,000 to €1,100.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/about/foi/s16/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-44.pdf">Earned
Income Credit (pdf)</a> for taxpayers earning self-employed trading or
professional income in certain cases and for business owner/managers who are
ineligible for a PAYE credit on their salary income is increasing from €550
to €950.<strong></strong><strong></strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it70.html#section1">residential
rental property relief</a> available for qualifying interest payments on monies
borrowed to purchase, improve or repair residential rental property is being
increased from 75% to 80%. This measure will apply to both new and existing
mortgages.</p>

<p>The ceiling for exemption from income tax under the <a href="../housing/owning_a_home/home_owners/rent_a_room_scheme.html">Rent a
Room scheme</a> for income received from the letting of a room or rooms in a
person’s principal private residence is being increased from €12,000 to
€14,000 for 2017 and subsequent years.<strong></strong></p>

<p>An <a href="../housing/owning_a_home/help_with_buying_a_home/help_to_buy_incentive.html">income
tax rebate incentive for first-time buyers of new homes</a> is being introduced
to help fund the deposit required under the Central Bank macro-prudential
rules. It will consist of a rebate of income tax paid over the previous four
years up to 5% of the purchase price of up to €400,000. Where new homes are
valued between €400,000 and €600,000 the maximum relief of €20,000 will
continue to be available. The house must be a new build and applicants must
take out a mortgage of at least 80% of the purchase price. The scheme will run
until the end of 2019.</p>

<p>The <a href="../housing/housing_grants_and_schemes/home_renovation_incentive.html">Home
Renovation Incentive (HRI)</a>, which provides an income tax credit to
homeowners who carry out renovation and improvement works on their principal
private residences, is being extended until 31 December 2018.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/personal/living-city-initiative.html">Living
City Initiative</a>, which aims to assist the regeneration of retail and
commercial districts and encourage families to live in historic buildings in
city centres is being amended to encourage an increase in the take-up of the
scheme. This involves extending the availability of the scheme to landlords,
while for residential applicants it removes the restriction on the maximum
floor size of the property, removes the requirement that the property must have
been previously used as a dwelling, and reduces the minimum amount of
expenditure needed to qualify.</p>

<p>A new <strong>Fishers Tax Credit</strong> is being introduced to assist the
viability of the fishing sector. Fishers who have fished for wild fish or wild
shellfish for at least 80 days in a tax year can claim an income tax credit of

<h3>Universal Social Charge (USC)</h3>

<p>Incomes of €13,000 or less will continue to be exempt from <a href="tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">USC</a> in 2017. Once

your income as follows:</p>

income does not exceed €60,000 will pay a maximum USC rate of 2.5%.</p>

<h3>Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT)</h3>

<p>The rate of <a href="tax/tax_on_savings_and_investments/deposit_interest_retention_tax.html">Deposit
Interest Retention Tax</a> will decrease by 2% each year for the next 4 years
until it reaches 33%.</p>

<h3>Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT)</h3>

    children is being raised from €280,000 to €310,000</li>
  <li>The Group B threshold applying to gifts and inheritances made to parents,
    siblings, nieces, nephews or grandchildren is being raised from €30,150
    to €32,500</li>
  <li>The Group C threshold applying to gifts and inheritances made to all
    others (except spouses and civil partners who are exempt) is being raised
    from €15,075 to €16,250</li>
</ul><p>These increases apply in respect of gifts or inheritances received on or
after 12 October 2016.</p>

<h3>Excise duties</h3>

<p>The excise duty on a <strong>packet of 20 cigarettes</strong> is being
increased by 50 cents (including VAT) with a pro-rata increase on the other
tobacco products, with effect from midnight on 11 October 2016.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/vrt-guide.html">Vehicle
Registration Tax (VRT)</a> reliefs available for the purchase of hybrid
electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, are being extended to
31 December 2018. Reliefs available for electric vehicles and electric
motorcycles are being extended to 31 December 2021.<strong></strong></p>

<p>The special relief reducing the standard rate of Alcohol Products Tax by 50%
on <strong>beers produced in microbreweries</strong> which produce not more
than 30,000 hectolitres per annum is being extended to apply to microbreweries
which produce not more than 40,000 hectolitres per annum. Relief is still
available on the first 30,000 hectolitres of beer produced.</p>

<p>The fuel inputs used to create <strong>high efficiency electricity in
combined heat and power plants</strong> are being fully exempted from carbon
tax.</p>

<h3>Capital Gains Tax (CGT)</h3>

<p>A reduced <a href="tax/capital_taxes/capital_gains_tax.html">Capital
Gains Tax</a> rate of 10% will apply to the <strong>disposal in whole or in
part of a business</strong> up to an overall limit of €1 million in
qualifying chargeable gains.</p>

<p>Payments under the new <strong>raised bog restoration incentive
scheme</strong> to relevant owners and rights holders will be exempt from
Capital Gains Tax.</p>

<h3>Agri Measures</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vat/rates/decision-detail-03244.jsp">Farmer’s
Flat-Rate Addition</a> will increase from 5.2% to 5.4% with effect from 1
January 2017. Farmers not registered for VAT add a Flat-Rate percentage to
their sales of produce and agricultural services to VAT registered customers
who are entitled to reclaim such VAT in their VAT returns. The flat-rate scheme
compensates the farmers for VAT incurred on their farming inputs.</p>

<p>The scheme of <a href="http://www.dccae.gov.ie/energy/en-ie/Pages/Legislation/Accelerated-Capital-Allowances.aspx">accelerated
capital allowances for energy efficient equipment</a> is being made available
to sole traders and non-corporates.</p>

<p>The <strong>Income Averaging regime</strong> allows a farmer’s taxable
profit to be averaged out over a 5-year period. This is being amended to allow
an “opt out” in a single year of unexpectedly poor income, and, instead,
pay only the tax due on a current year basis with any deferred tax liability
becoming payable over subsequent years. This may be availed of for the 2016 tax
year.</p>

<p><strong>Farm restructuring CGT relief</strong> is available where the first
transaction in the restructuring (e.g. sale, purchase or exchange of land) is
carried out by 31 December 2016 with the restructuring to be completed within
24 months. The deadline for the completion of the first restructuring
transaction is being extended to 31 December 2019.</p>

<h3>Housing</h3>

<p>A total of €1.2 billion is allocated to the Department of Housing,
Planning, Community and Local Government for Housing in 2017. This will allow
for continued implementation of the <a href="http://rebuildingireland.ie/">Housing Action Plan</a>. Under the Plan, it
is intended that 47,000 new social housing units will be delivered by 2021.</p>

<p>The total includes an Exchequer allocation of €50 million for the €200
million <strong>Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund</strong>, to
accelerate the provision of public infrastructure to support the development of
sites for private housing in urban areas. It is hoped that this fund will
facilitate the delivery of up to 20,000 private houses by 2019.</p>

<p>In addition, local authorities will use €92 million from surplus Local
Property Tax receipts to fund a range of housing services.</p>

<h4>Social housing support</h4>

<p>A total capital provision of €732m has been allocated in 2017 to support
the delivery of 4,450 <strong>social housing units</strong>. These will be
provided through construction and acquisitions by local authorities and
approved housing bodies; Rapid Builds; Part V mechanisms; bringing an expected
800 vacant units back into use; and delivering new units under the National
Regeneration Programme.</p>

<p>Under the <strong>Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme</strong>, a
provision of €84 million is to support the delivery of 600 direct leased
units in 2017.</p>

<p>An additional €105 million is allocated for the <a href="../housing/renting_a_home/housing_assistance_payment.html">Housing
Assistance Payment (HAP)</a> in 2017, with a target of 15,000 households for

<p>An income tax rebate, the <a href="../housing/owning_a_home/help_with_buying_a_home/help_to_buy_incentive.html">Help-to-Buy
incentive</a>, is being introduced to help first-time buyers of newly built
homes to fund the deposit required under the Central Bank’s rules. It also
applies to once-off self-build homes. It will consist of a rebate of income tax
paid over the previous 4 years.</p>

<p>To qualify for the scheme, applicants must take out a mortgage of at least
80% of the purchase price (or, for a self-build, 80% of the valuation approved
by the mortgage provider).</p>

<p>For new homes costing up to €400,000, a rebate of up to 5% of the purchase
price will be available. For homes costing between €400,000 and €600,000,
the maximum relief will be €20,000.</p>

Affordable Childcare Scheme</a> will provide a targeted subsidy, based on
parental income, for children aged between 6 months and 15 years and a
universal subsidy, for all families, for children aged between 6 months and 3
years.</p>

<p><strong>Targeted subsidy:</strong> The highest level of subsidy will be

week. The rate of subsidy will taper downwards as net income rises, with no
targeted subsidy payable when net income reaches €47,500. The income
thresholds increase if there is more than one child in the family.</p>

<p><strong>Universal subsidy:</strong> Up to €80 per month will be provided
towards childcare costs. This equates to over €900 per annum for parents
working full-time and will be paid pro-rata.</p>

Tusla-registered childcare provider – including centre-based providers and
child minders.</p>

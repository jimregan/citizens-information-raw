<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The main Budget changes which may affect people living in Ireland are set
out below. </p>

<p>This document sets out changes in the areas of social welfare, tax, health,
transport, environment, housing, education, employment and other areas. It is
an overview and not a complete statement of the measures announced in Budget
2011. <strong>The document will be expanded and updated as information becomes
available</strong>.</p>

<p>Some of the changes announced in the Budget come into effect immediately.
Others take effect from the beginning of January 2011. Many others have to be
finalised before coming into effect. Some elements of these measures may change
when the Finance Bill is published – this is expected in early 2011.</p>

<p>For a full list of the Budget changes, please read the Department of
Finance’s <a href="http://www.budget.gov.ie">Summary of Budget
Measures</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lae27e">Social Welfare</h2>

<h3>Rates of payment</h3>

<h3>Older people</h3>

<p>There will be no change in the rates of State pensions or other payments for
those aged over 66, for example, Living Alone Allowance, Household Benefits
Scheme and Fuel Allowance.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>People of working age</h3>

<p>The maximum personal rate of payment for all weekly schemes will be reduced
by €8 per week, except for personal rates for those aged 66 and over, and
Invalidity Pension and State Pension Transition recipients aged 65. Changes
will come into effect from the first week in January 2011.</p>

<p>Associated maximum Increase for a Qualified Adult will generally decrease by
€5.30 per week from the first week in January 2011.</p>

<p>Proportionate decreases will apply to both personal rates and Increase for a
Qualified Adult in respect of people on reduced social insurance rates of
payment.</p>

<p>There will be a decrease of €8 per week in the maximum and minimum rate of
Maternity and Adoptive Benefits.</p>

<p>There will be a reduction of €6 per week in the rate of Jobseeker’s
Allowance and Supplementary Welfare Allowance for those aged 22-24.</p>

<p>The rate of payment of Jobseeker’s Allowance and Supplementary Welfare
Allowance for those aged 18-21 is unchanged.</p>

<p>There will be a reduction of €10 in the personal weekly rate of
Supplementary Welfare Allowance.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Fuel Allowance</h3>

<p>In response to the current severe weather, a once-off additional 2 weeks
payment will be paid to most recipients in the next few weeks, with the
remainder of recipients getting this payment in early January. This measure
will be worth €40 to recipients.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>Child Benefit will be reduced by €10 per month from January 2011 on both
the lower and higher rate with an additional €10 per month decrease for the
third child. Grants for multiple births (twins etc.) will not be reduced.</p>

<p>Other child-related payments are unchanged: Qualified Child Increases,
Family Income Supplement, Back to School Footwear and Clothing Allowance,
Widowed Parent Grant and Domiciliary Care Allowance.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Carers</h3>

<p>The rate of payment will be reduced by €8 for carers aged under 66. Carers
aged 66 or over will not be affected.</p>

<p>There are no other changes to Carer’s schemes: the half-rate payment, the
additional payment for caring for more than one person and the Respite Care
Grant are retained.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Rent Supplement</h3>

<p>The Rent Supplement Scheme will be reformed in order to control expenditure.
This will include an additional €2 per week contribution by certain welfare
recipients towards the cost of rent. This follows from the reduction in the
rate of Supplementary Welfare Allowance.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Treatment Benefits</h3>

<p>The Treatment Benefit Scheme will continue to be limited in 2011 to the
Medical and Surgical Appliances scheme and the free examination elements of the
Dental and Optical Benefit schemes.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Other measures</h3>

<p>There will be a reduction in expenditure on Departmental administration. A
range of other measures relating to control, eligibility and structural reform
will be announced at a later date.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Jobseeker's Allowance</h3>

<p>The rates below relate to claimants who have no assessable means.</p>

<p>The new thresholds from 8 December are:</p>

<table border="1"><caption></caption>
  <col><col><tbody><tr><td>Group A: €332,084 </td>
      <td>Applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child,
        step-child and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased
        child of the disponer. In certain circumstances parents also fall
        within this threshold where they take an inheritance from a child. 

        <p></p>
      </td>
    </tr><tr><td>Group B: €33,208 </td>
      <td>Applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, niece, nephew or

<p></p>

<p></p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l3d45f">Employment and pensions</h2>

<h3>National minimum wage</h3>

<p>The national minimum wage rate is to be reduced by €1 per hour as stated
in the <a href="http://www.merrionstreet.ie/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/EUIMFmemo.pdf">Memorandum
of Understanding of the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland
(pdf)</a>. This reduced rate will not apply to existing employees as a
reduction in their wages would be a <a href="../employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/contracts_of_employment/change_job_contract.html">change
to their terms and conditions of employment</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Relevant Contracts Tax</h3>

<p>Relevant Contracts Tax applies to contractors in the construction,
meat-processing and forestry sectors of the economy. To foster compliance, a
new withholding rate of 20% will apply to subcontractors registered for tax
with an established compliance record, with the existing 35% rate retained for
subcontractors not registered for tax.</p>

<h3>Three-year tax exemption for start-up companies</h3>
This scheme is being extended to include start-up companies which start a new
trade in 2011. The scheme is being modified so that the value of the relief
will be linked to the amount of employers’ PRSI paid by a company in an
accounting period subject to a maximum of €5,000 per employee. If the amount
of qualifying employers’ PRSI is lower than the reduction in corporation tax
liability otherwise applicable, relief will be based on the lower amount 

<p>The Business Expansion Scheme will be transformed into the Employment and
Investment Incentive with an increase in the amount that companies can raise
under the scheme.</p>

<h3>Employment-related tax reliefs abolished from 1 January 2011</h3>
<ul><li>Tax relief for trade union subscriptions</li>
  <li>The tax exemption from Benefit in Kind (BIK) for employer provided
    childcare</li>
  <li>Tax relief on subscriptions to professional bodies</li>
  <li>Approved Share Options Scheme, effective from the launch of the National
    Recovery Plan on 24 November 2010</li>
  <li>Tax relief for new shares purchased by employees</li>
</ul><h3>Labour market activation</h3>
<ul><li>Refocus the National Employment Action Plan to provide opportunities for
    education, training and work experience placements</li>
  <li>Additional 15,000 activation places and supports for the unemployed</li>
  <li>Extension of Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme to end 2011</li>
</ul><p></p>

<h3>Pensions</h3>

<h3>Social welfare pensions</h3>

<p>There will be no change to social welfare pension rates.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Tax relief on pension contributions</h3>

<p>The annual earnings limit on which pension tax relief is applicable is being
reduced from €150,000 (2010) to €115,000 for 2011.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Employee pension contributions</h3>

<p>Employee contributions to occupational pension schemes and other pension
arrangements will be subject to employee PRSI and the Universal Social Charge
from 1 January 2011</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Public service pension-related deduction</h3>

<p>The pension-related deduction charged to earnings in the public service will
be subject to employee PRSI and the Universal Social Charge from 1 January
2011.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Employer PRSI exemption on pension contributions</h3>

<p>The current employer PRSI exemption for employee contributions to
occupational pension schemes and other pension arrangements will be reduced by
50% from 1 January 2011.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Maximum allowable pension funds</h3>

<p>The maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes (known as
the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT)), is to be set at €2.3 million with effect
from 7 December 2010. A higher threshold may apply if, on 7 December 2010, the
capital value of an individual’s pension rights drawn down on or after 7
December 2005 (i.e. crystallised pension rights) when added to any
uncrystallised pension rights the individual may have, as valued on 7 December
2010, are greater than €2.3 million and lower than €5,418,085 which is the
current value of the SFT. This change will apply with effect from 1 January
2011.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Approved Retirement Funds</h3>

<p>The annual imputed distribution which applies to the value of assets in an
Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) at 31 December each year is being increased from
3% to 5% in respect of asset values at 31 December 2010 and future years. This
change will apply with effect from 1 January 2011.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Retirement lump sums</h3>

<p>The overall life-time limit on the amount of tax-free retirement lump sums
that an individual can draw down from pension arrangements is being reduced to
€200,000. Lump sums over €200,000 will be taxed at the standard income tax
rate (currently 20%) up to €575,000 (25% of the new Standard Fund Threshold).
Anything over this amount will be taxed at the taxpayer’s marginal rate of
income tax. </p>

<p>Tax-free retirement lump sums taken on or after 7 December 2005 will count
towards “using up” the new tax free amount so that if a person has already
taken tax free retirement lump sums of €200,000 or more since 7 December
2005, any further retirement lump sums paid to them on or after 1 January 2011
will be taxable. These earlier lump sums will also count towards determining
how much of a lump sum paid on or after Budget day is to be charged at the
standard or marginal tax rate. This change will apply with effect from 1
January 2011.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Extension of flexible options on retirement</h3>

<p>All members of defined contribution pension arrangements will have access to
flexible options on retirement in respect of the main benefits arising from
those schemes, subject to certain conditions. These will be provided for in the
Finance Bill.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can find out more about the pension changes in <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/press/budget/2011/pensions-changes.pdf">Revenue's
Frequently Asked Questions document</a> (pdf).</p>

<h3>Housing</h3>

<h3>Tax relief for energy efficiency measures</h3>

<p>A new scheme will be introduced to encourage people to make their homes more

tax year.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Rent relief</h3>

<h3>Stamp duty</h3>

<p>The rate of stamp duty for transfers of residential property will reduce to
1% on properties valued up to €1 million. A rate of 2% will apply to amounts

December 2010, and who executes the transfer of that property before 1 July
2011, will not lose out.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Tenant Purchase Scheme</h3>

<p>A higher discount is being introduced in the short term for existing local
authority tenants who wish to purchase their homes under the Tenant Purchase
Scheme.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Household charge</h3>

<p>A flat rate “household charge” will be introduced in 2012 as an interim
measure. It will be followed in 2013 by a final Site Value Tax, which will be
introduced when valuations have been completed.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Water metering</h3>

<p>The National Recovery Plan 2011-14 also provides for the roll-out of water
metering to domestic users, with water charges to follow on a metered basis
alongside a free allowance.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<h3>Travel and Recreation</h3>

<h3>Tax on petrol and diesel</h3>

<p>Tax will be increased by 4 cent per litre on petrol and 2 cent per litre on
diesel (both inclusive of VAT) with effect from midnight on 7 December 2010.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p>Passport fees are to be introduced for those aged 65 or over.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT)</h3>

<p>The car scrappage scheme is being extended for the period 1 January to 30
June 2011. VRT relief of up to €1,250 will be provided where a car of 10
years or older is scrapped in accordance with certain criteria and a new car of
emissions bands A or B (i.e. with CO2 emissions of 140g/kg or less) is
purchased.</p>

<p>The VRT relief for series production hybrid and flexible fuel vehicles, due
to expire on 31 December 2010, is being extended for 2 years until 31 December
2012, with the rate of relief provided being up to €1,500.</p>

<p>Light commercial vehicles charged VRT at the Category C VRT rate of €50
will, from 1 January 2011, be charged the Category B rate of 13.3% of the Open
Market Selling Price (OMSP).</p>

<p></p>

<p>A single revised rate of air travel tax of €3 will replace the existing
two-rate structure on a temporary basis from 1 March 2011.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Growth Incentive Scheme for airlines</h3>

<p>The Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) is to introduce a new Growth Incentive
Scheme for airlines operating at Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports. The Scheme,
which will provide a full rebate of airport charges in respect of traffic at
all three airports above an annual threshold of €23.5m, is to encourage
overall traffic passenger growth at the airports.</p>

<p></p>

betting duty on those bets in the same way that betting shops currently do.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>School transport</h3>

<p>The school transport charge for post-primary students increases by €50 to
€350 per year, with a maximum charge of €650 per family.</p>

<p>A new charge of €50 is introduced for primary school pupils, except for
medical card holders , with a maximum charge of €110 per family.</p>

<p>The charges are subject to an overall maximum charge of €650 per
family.</p>

<p>For the school year 2011/2012, the distance criteria will be applied to all
pupils attending primary schools. This means that children who live less than
3.2 kilometres (2 miles) from school, and who get free transport under the
“closed school” rule at present, will lose their transport eligibility.</p>

<p>Services for very small numbers of pupils will be discontinued. A minimum of
10 eligible children (up from 7 at present) will be required to establish or
retain services.</p>

<p>Further changes arising from the recent Value for Money review will take
effect from a later date.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Capitation grants</h3>

<p>There is a 5% reduction in all capitation grants, including grants for adult
literacy, community education, the School Completion Programme and
Youthreach.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Student charges</h3>

<p>The Student Services Charge for third-level students is replaced by a
flat-rate higher education student contribution of €2,000 per year.
Arrangements will be made to provide that second and subsequent siblings from a
single family will not have to bear the full increased cost of the new €2,000
charge.</p>

<p>It is intended that this contribution will be payable in two instalments.
Students qualifying for third-level grants will not have to pay it.</p>

<p>A new charge of €200 per year is introduced for Post-Leaving Certificate
(PLC) students. Students qualifying for maintenance grants will not have to pay
this charge.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Student Support Scheme</h3>

<p>The rates of the following grants are reduced by 4% in line with the
reductions in all Department of Social Protection (DSP) working-age payments</p>
<ul><li>Higher Education Grants Scheme</li>
  <li>Vocational Education Committees' Scholarship Scheme</li>
  <li>Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees</li>
  <li>Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students Attending Post-Leaving Certificate
    Courses</li>
</ul><p>It is expected that these reduced rates will apply to the remaining portions
of grants for the current academic year that are due to be paid in 2011. </p>

<p>The benefits payable to mature students will be limited to those payable to
ordinary students. Mature students will no longer be automatically eligible for
the non-adjacent rate of grant.</p>

<p>The proportion of students qualifying for the non-adjacent rate of grant
will be reduced by changing the qualifying distance between the student’s
home and college from 24km to 45km. It is expected that these changes will take
effect from the 2011/2012 academic year.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Funding of third-level institutions</h3>

<p>There is a 5% cut in the non-pay grant to institutions such as universities
and institutes of technology.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Education for Travellers</h3>

<p>Senior Traveller Training Centres (STTCs) will be phased out by June 2012.
Replacement further education places, prioritised for Travellers, will be
provided under the Back to Education Initiative (BTEI). This means that there
will be no new enrolments in STTCs from 1 January 2011.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS)</h3>

<p>The number of psychologists employed by NEPS will be capped at the current
level of 178.</p>

<h3>FÁS payments</h3>

<p>All weekly training allowances and similar support payments paid through
FÁS are reduced by €8 in line with the reductions in all Department of
Social Protection (DSP) working-age payments.</p>

<p>The long-term unemployment bonus paid to students on the Vocational Training
Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) is reduced from €31.80 to €20 per week.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Labour market activation programmes</h3>

<p>The National Employment Action Plan will be refocused to establish clearer
pathways to employment by ensuring that State agencies interact early and often
with those who have lost their jobs to provide opportunities for education,
training or work experience placements as appropriate.</p>

<p>An additional 15,000 activation places and supports for the unemployed will
be provided under the following programmes:</p>
<ul><li>A new Skills Development and Internship Programme will provide up to
    5,000 places in the private sector.</li>
  <li>The Work Placement Programme will provide up to 5,000 places in the
    public service. The scheme was recently extended in the Education sector
    and will be extended further within other sectors over the coming
  months.</li>
  <li>A new Community Work Placement Scheme will provide up to 5,000 additional
    places in the community and voluntary sector. Participants will work 19.5
    hours a week for 12 months and their rate of payment will be the maximum
    rate of their social welfare payment plus a weekly €20 top up. </li>
</ul><p></p>

<h3>Health</h3>

<h3>Hospital charges</h3>

<p>There are no increases in the Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) charge, the

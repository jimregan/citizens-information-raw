updated throughout the week as details become available.</strong></p>

<p>The main Budget changes that may affect people living in Ireland are set out
below. </p>

<p>This document sets out changes in the areas of taxation, social welfare,
health, housing, education, employment and other areas. It is an overview and
not a complete statement of the measures announced in Budget 2013.</p>

<p>Some of the changes announced in the Budget come into effect immediately.
Others take effect from the beginning of January 2013 or in mid-2013. Many
others have to be finalised before coming into effect. </p>

<p>Some elements of these measures may change when the legislation required to
bring them into effect is enacted. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l01933">Taxation</h2>

<p>Changes apply to the year 2013, unless specified otherwise.</p>

<h3>Personal credits and allowances</h3>

<p>There are no changes in personal credits and allowances and bands except for
Rent Tax Relief.</p>

<p>Rent Tax Relief will be reduced, as in previous years:</p>

  <col><col><tbody><tr><td>Single under 55 yrs</td>
      <td>€1,000</td>

        <p>Over 55 years</p>
      </td>
      <td>€3,600</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><h3>Other income tax changes</h3>

<p>Maternity Benefit will be taxable for all claimants. Universal Social Charge
will not be payable. (1 July 2013)</p>

<p>Top Slicing Relief, which is a reduction of tax due on lump sum payments
when leaving employment, will not be available on lump sums of €200,000 or
more. It will apply to payments made on or after 1 January 2013.</p>

<p>Tax relief on all charitable donations will now be claimed by the charitable
organisation at a single tax rate of 31%. The maximum qualifying amount will be
€1 million.</p>

<h3>PRSI</h3>

<p><a href="#prsi">See below for details of PRSI changes</a>.</p>

<h3>Universal Social Charge (USC)</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2013 reduced rates of USC will only apply to people aged 70
years of age and over earning €60,000 or less and to medical card holders
under 70 earning €60,000 or less. People with incomes of €10,036 or less
continue to be exempt from USC.</p>

<h3><a name="lpt"></a>Local Property Tax (LPT)</h3>

<p>The Local Property Tax (LPT) will come into force on 1 July 2013. A half
year payment will be due for the second half of 2013, with a full year payment
due in 2014.</p>

<p>The property owner will be liable for the LPT. This includes local
authorities and social housing organisations.</p>

<p>Where the property is valued at €1 million or lower, the tax will be based
on the mid-point of the relevant band at a rate of 0.18%. For properties valued
over €1 million the tax will be charged at 0.18% on the first €1 million of
value and 0.25% on any balance in excess of €1 million, with no banding
applied.</p>

<p>Payment can be made by credit or debit card, cash, direct debit or by
voluntary deduction at source from Irish salary or wages, occupational pensions
or certain payments from the Department of Social Protection and the Department
of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>

<p>If the LPT is not paid, a charge will attach to the property which must be
paid if the property is sold or the ownership transferred.</p>

<p>The Revenue Commissioners will send out an explanatory booklet on the
operation of LPT, including valuation procedures, in March 2013.</p>

<p>Valuation will be by self-assessment in 2013 and those valuations will be
used until the end of 2016.</p>

<h4>Exemptions</h4>

<p>The exemptions from the LPT will be the same as those applied to the
Household Charge, with the following additional exemptions:</p>
<ul><li>New and previously unoccupied homes purchased between 1 January 2013 and
    31 December 2016 will be exempt up to the end of 2016.</li>
  <li>Second-hand property purchased by a first time buyer between 1 January
    2013 and 31 December 2013 will be exempt until the end of 2016.</li>

<p>People with gross incomes of up to €15,000 (single) and €25,000
(couples) can defer the full LPT until their financial circumstances improve or
the property is sold.</p>

<p>Certain deferral arrangements are also available for people at higher levels
of income, and for people whose income is less than a certain percentage of
their annual mortgage interest.</p>

<p>Some owner-occupiers may be eligible to apply for marginal relief, which
will allow them to defer up to 50% of their LPT liability.</p>

<p>Interest will be charged on deferred amounts at a rate of 4% per annum.</p>

<p>The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance will reduce by €50 per
child. This means that the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance will
reduce from €250 to €200 for children aged 12-17 or aged 18-22 in full-time
education and from €150 to €100 for children aged 4-11 years. (2013)</p>

<h4>One-Parent Family Payment</h4>

<p>The age reductions in the One-Parent Family Payment which were due to apply
from the beginning of 2013 and 2014 are being deferred to the beginning of July
in each of those years. In addition, the period over which the transitional
arrangements applying to existing recipients are to apply, will be extended
from the end of 2014 to the beginning of July 2015. This change will provide
more time for the creation of additional childcare places (see also 'Children
Plus Initiative' below). This provision requires legislation and is not yet in
effect. (This measure was not announced in Budget 2013 - it was inserted into
the Social Welfare Bill 2012.)</p>

<h3>Carers</h3>

<p>There are no changes to rates of carer’s payments, to the half-rate
Carer’s Allowance or to the extra payment for caring for more than 1
person.</p>

<h4>Respite Care Grant</h4>

<p>The annual Respite Care Grant will reduce from €1,700 to €1,375 for each
person receiving care. (2013)</p>

<h3>Older people </h3>

<p>There are no changes to State pension rates.</p>

<h4><strong>State Pension (Contributory)</strong></h4>

<p>There will be changes to the definition of ‘yearly average’ and
‘alternative yearly average’ to enable rounding of figures. The increase in
the number of qualifying contributions required (from 260 to 520) will now also
apply to people getting reduced rate pensions on or after 1 January 2013.</p>

<p>Special pro-rata pensions for people with intermittent insurance (paid to
people who had problems meeting yearly average requirements because they were
not compulsorily insured before 1974) are being abolished.</p>

<h4>State Pension Transition</h4>

<p>New reduced rates of pension are payable for people who qualify for pensions
on or after 1 January 2013 with a reduced yearly average of contributions.
These reduced rates also apply to increases for qualified adults paid with the
reduced rate pension.</p>

<h4>Household Benefits Package</h4>

<p>The value of the Telephone Allowance and the Electricity/Gas Allowance
elements of the Household Benefits package will reduce for new and existing
recipients.</p>

<p>The value of the Telephone Allowance will be reduced. The new monthly rate
of €9.50 will show as a credit on the customer's bill or be paid as a cash
allowance. (January 2013)</p>

<p>The Electricity/Gas Allowance will be set at a single rate based on the
average market rate across all suppliers currently available (for an unchanged
150 units per month). The new rate of €35 per month will show as a cash
credit for those who receive a bill or be paid as a cash allowance. (January
2013)</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Schemes/HouseholdBenefits/Pages/hhbchangesfaq.aspx">frequently
asked questions on changes to the Household Benefits Package on
welfare.ie</a>.</p>

<p>There are no changes to the Fuel Allowance, Free Travel, Free TV Licence
schemes or Living Alone Allowance.</p>

<h3>Children Plus Initiative </h3>

<p>From 2013 on, €14 million per year will be allocated from the Department
of Social Protection to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to fund a
joint initiative that will provide over 6,000 after-school childcare places for
children in primary school. This will be targeted at children from low-income
families whose parents are availing of an employment opportunity (who engage
with the Department of Social Protection’s INTREO service). It is envisaged
that interested childcare providers, both community and commercial, will be
paid a subsidy where a parent is referred by the Department of Social
Protection under the initiative. The initiative will commence with a pilot
scheme in early 2013.</p>

<p>An additional €2 million will be allocated to the School Meals Programme.
</p>

<p>€2.5 million in funding will be allocated to the Department of Children
and Youth Affairs for its Area-Based Child Poverty Initiative. This initiative
will be co-funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and
philanthropic partners.</p>

<h3><a name="prsi"></a>PRSI</h3>

<p>The Employee's PRSI-Free Allowance of €127 per week (for those paying PRSI
Class A, E and H) and €26 per week (for those paying PRSI Class B, C and D)
will be abolished. (January 2013)</p>

<p>Employees who earn €352 or less per week continue to have no liability to
make a PRSI contribution and are not affected by the abolition of the weekly
PRSI-Free Allowance.</p>

<p>Currently, employees who pay PRSI at Classes B, C and D are exempt from PRSI
on self-employed earned income (from a profession or trade) and any other
unearned income (for example, rental income.) This exemption will be abolished.
All such income will become liable to PRSI at the rate of 4%. (1 January
2013)</p>

<p>Unearned income for everyone else will become subject to PRSI in 2014. This
means that PRSI will be payable on income generated from wealth such as rental
income, investment income, dividends and interest on deposits and savings.
(2014)</p>

<p>The minimum annual PRSI contribution for people with annual self-employed
income over €5,000 will increase from €253 per annum to €500. (2013)</p>

<p><strong>Voluntary contributions</strong></p>

<p>The flat-rate voluntary contribution paid by a formerly self-employed person
is being increased from €253 to €500. Former contributors at Classes A, H
and E will continue to pay voluntary contributions at 6.6% but their minimum
payment will increase from €317 to €500. Former contributors at modified
rates continue to pay voluntary contributions at 2.6% but their minimum payment
will increase from €126 to €250 (1 January 2013)</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Miscellaneous savings </h3>

<p>The cost to the Department of Social Protection of medical certificates for
illness and disability-related schemes will be reduced. This is an
administrative saving in the Department.</p>

<p>Savings will be achieved on Exceptional Needs Payments under the
Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme.</p>

<h4>Overpayment recovery</h4>

<p>Up to 15% of a person’s weekly social welfare payment can be deducted for
the purpose of recovering an overpayment. A person is not entitled to
compensate for any overpayment deduction by getting an additional payment of
Supplementary Welfare Allowance.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Redundancy payments </h3>

<p>The employer rebate of statutory redundancy payments (currently 15%) will be
discontinued. (January 2013)</p>

    credit from banks</li>
  <li>The National Pensions Reserve Fund is also developing a range of support

Jobseeker’s Allowance will get a standard maximum rate of €160 per week. (1
January 2013)</p>

<h4>Labour market activation</h4>

<p>€48 million has been provided in the National Training Fund for labour
activation measures for the unemployed and targeted skills training in 2013.</p>

will involve moving child welfare and protection services out of the HSE and
creating a new statutory body which will encompass both the National
Educational Welfare Board and the Family Support Agency.</p>

<h4>Children’s Detention Centre </h4>

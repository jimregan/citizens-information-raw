<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l01933">Taxation</h2>

<h3>Income tax</h3>

<p>The <a href="tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/home_carers_tax_credit.html">Home
Carer's Tax Credit</a> that is given to married couples or civil partners where
one spouse or civil partner works in the home caring for a dependent person is
increasing from €1,000 to €1,100.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/about/foi/s16/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-44.pdf">Earned
Income Credit (pdf)</a> for taxpayers earning self-employed trading or
professional income in certain cases and for business owner/managers who are
ineligible for a PAYE credit on their salary income is increasing from €550
to €950.<strong></strong><strong></strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it70.html#section1">residential
rental property relief</a> available for qualifying interest payments on monies
borrowed to purchase, improve or repair residential rental property is being
increased from 75% to 80%. This measure will apply to both new and existing
mortgages.</p>

<p>The ceiling for exemption from income tax under the <a href="../housing/owning_a_home/home_owners/rent_a_room_scheme.html">Rent a
Room scheme</a> for income received from the letting of a room or rooms in a
person’s principal private residence is being increased from €12,000 to
€14,000 for 2017 and subsequent years.<strong></strong></p>

<p>An <a href="../housing/owning_a_home/help_with_buying_a_home/help_to_buy_incentive.html">income
tax rebate incentive for first-time buyers of new homes</a> is being introduced
to help fund the deposit required under the Central Bank macro-prudential
rules. It will consist of a rebate of income tax paid over the previous four
years up to 5% of the purchase price of up to €400,000. Where new homes are
valued between €400,000 and €600,000 the maximum relief of €20,000 will
continue to be available. The house must be a new build and applicants must
take out a mortgage of at least 80% of the purchase price. The scheme will run
until the end of 2019.</p>

<p>The <a href="../housing/housing_grants_and_schemes/home_renovation_incentive.html">Home
Renovation Incentive (HRI)</a>, which provides an income tax credit to
homeowners who carry out renovation and improvement works on their principal
private residences, is being extended until 31 December 2018.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/personal/living-city-initiative.html">Living
City Initiative</a>, which aims to assist the regeneration of retail and
commercial districts and encourage families to live in historic buildings in
city centres is being amended to encourage an increase in the take-up of the
scheme. This involves extending the availability of the scheme to landlords,
while for residential applicants it removes the restriction on the maximum
floor size of the property, removes the requirement that the property must have
been previously used as a dwelling, and reduces the minimum amount of
expenditure needed to qualify.</p>

<p>A new <strong>Fishers Tax Credit</strong> is being introduced to assist the
viability of the fishing sector. Fishers who have fished for wild fish or wild
shellfish for at least 80 days in a tax year can claim an income tax credit of
€1,270 per annum.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/foreign-earnings-deduction-fed.html">Foreign

  annum</li>
</ul><p>The <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/sarp.html">Special

Your Own Business tax relief</a> is being extended for 2 years until the end of
2018.</p>

<h3>Universal Social Charge (USC)</h3>

<p>Incomes of €13,000 or less will continue to be exempt from <a href="tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">USC</a> in 2017. Once

your income as follows:</p>

  <li>€12,012.01 to €18,772 @ 2.5%</li>

income does not exceed €60,000 will pay a maximum USC rate of 2.5%.</p>

<h3>Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT)</h3>

  <li>The Group B threshold applying to gifts and inheritances made to parents,
    siblings, nieces, nephews or grandchildren is being raised from €30,150

    others (except spouses and civil partners who are exempt) is being raised
    from €15,075 to €16,250</li>
</ul><p>These increases apply in respect of gifts or inheritances received on or

which produce not more than 40,000 hectolitres per annum. Relief is still
available on the first 30,000 hectolitres of beer produced.</p>

<p>The fuel inputs used to create <strong>high efficiency electricity in
combined heat and power plants</strong> are being fully exempted from carbon
tax.</p>

<h3>Capital Gains Tax (CGT)</h3>

<p>A reduced <a href="tax/capital_taxes/capital_gains_tax.html">Capital

<h3>Agri Measures</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vat/rates/decision-detail-03244.jsp">Farmer’s
Flat-Rate Addition</a> will increase from 5.2% to 5.4% with effect from 1
January 2017. Farmers not registered for VAT add a Flat-Rate percentage to
their sales of produce and agricultural services to VAT registered customers
who are entitled to reclaim such VAT in their VAT returns. The flat-rate scheme
compensates the farmers for VAT incurred on their farming inputs.</p>

<p>The scheme of <a href="http://www.dccae.gov.ie/energy/en-ie/Pages/Legislation/Accelerated-Capital-Allowances.aspx">accelerated
capital allowances for energy efficient equipment</a> is being made available
to sole traders and non-corporates.</p>

<p>The <strong>Income Averaging regime</strong> allows a farmer’s taxable
profit to be averaged out over a 5-year period. This is being amended to allow
an “opt out” in a single year of unexpectedly poor income, and, instead,
pay only the tax due on a current year basis with any deferred tax liability
becoming payable over subsequent years. This may be availed of for the 2016 tax
year.</p>

<p><strong>Farm restructuring CGT relief</strong> is available where the first
transaction in the restructuring (e.g. sale, purchase or exchange of land) is
carried out by 31 December 2016 with the restructuring to be completed within
24 months. The deadline for the completion of the first restructuring
transaction is being extended to 31 December 2019.</p>

Education and Childcare</h2>

<h3>Housing</h3>

<p>A total of €1.2 billion is allocated to the Department of Housing,
Planning, Community and Local Government for Housing in 2017. This will allow
for continued implementation of the <a href="http://rebuildingireland.ie/">Housing Action Plan</a>. Under the Plan, it
is intended that 47,000 new social housing units will be delivered by 2021.</p>

<p>The total includes an Exchequer allocation of €50 million for the €200
million <strong>Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund</strong>, to
accelerate the provision of public infrastructure to support the development of
sites for private housing in urban areas. It is hoped that this fund will
facilitate the delivery of up to 20,000 private houses by 2019.</p>

<p>In addition, local authorities will use €92 million from surplus Local
Property Tax receipts to fund a range of housing services.</p>

<h4>Social housing support</h4>

<p>A total capital provision of €732m has been allocated in 2017 to support
the delivery of 4,450 <strong>social housing units</strong>. These will be
provided through construction and acquisitions by local authorities and
approved housing bodies; Rapid Builds; Part V mechanisms; bringing an expected
800 vacant units back into use; and delivering new units under the National
Regeneration Programme.</p>

<p>Under the <strong>Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme</strong>, a
provision of €84 million is to support the delivery of 600 direct leased
units in 2017.</p>

<p>An additional €105 million is allocated for the <a href="../housing/renting_a_home/housing_assistance_payment.html">Housing
Assistance Payment (HAP)</a> in 2017, with a target of 15,000 households for
transfer to HAP.</p>

<p>€134 million is allocated for the <a href="../housing/local_authority_and_social_housing/rental_accommodation_scheme.html">Rental
Accommodation Scheme (RAS)</a> with a target of 1,000 new RAS transfers.</p>

<p>Capital of €9m is to be provided in 2017 for <strong>Traveller-specific
accommodation</strong>. This will also support the carrying out of fire safety
works in Traveller accommodation.</p>

<p>It is expected that over 21,000 applicants for social housing will have
their housing needs met in 2017.</p>

<h4>Acquisition and renewal</h4>

<p>The Housing Agency is being allocated a €70m <strong>Rotating
Fund</strong> to acquire properties for social housing. The Fund is expected to
deliver 1,600 units by 2020.</p>

<p>€6 million is being allocated in 2017 for a <strong>Repair and Leasing
Initiative</strong>. Under this new initiative, local authorities will give
financial assistance to owners of vacant properties to bring them up to
standard, so that they can be leased for social housing. It is expected that
this new initiative will deliver 150 units in 2017.</p>

<p>Under a new <strong>Buy and Renew initiative</strong>, local authorities and
approved housing bodies will be supported to buy private housing units in need
of remediation, renew them and make them available for social housing use.
€25 million is being provided for this initiative in 2017.</p>

<h4>Adaptations and remediation</h4>

<p>Increased funding is provided for approximately 9,000 <a href="../housing/housing_grants_and_schemes/">housing adaptation grants for
older people and people with a disability</a>.</p>

<p>€22 million is provided for remediation of an additional 400 dwellings
under the <a href="https://www.housingagency.ie/our-services/pyrite-remediation-scheme.aspx">Pyrite
Remediation Scheme</a>.</p>

<h4>Supports for homeless people</h4>

<p>The current allocation for <strong></strong><a href="../housing/losing_your_home/homelessness.html">homelessness</a><strong></strong>services<strong></strong>
is increased by approximately €28 million, to €98 million.</p>

<p>It is intended that there will be 3,000 exits from emergency accommodation
in 2017 and that hotels will only be used in limited circumstances by
mid-2017.</p>

<p>Through the expanded <strong>Housing First</strong> programme, it is
intended that 300 people will move from homelessness into supported tenancies
in Dublin and other major urban areas.</p>

<p>These measures will be supported by increased funding in the areas of mental
health and addiction from the Department of Health and by additional supports
for children and families from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p>

<h4>Supports for home-buyers</h4>

<p>An income tax rebate, the <a href="../housing/owning_a_home/help_with_buying_a_home/help_to_buy_incentive.html">Help-to-Buy
incentive</a>, is being introduced to help first-time buyers of newly built
homes to fund the deposit required under the Central Bank’s rules. It also
applies to once-off self-build homes. It will consist of a rebate of income tax
paid over the previous 4 years.</p>

<p>To qualify for the scheme, applicants must take out a mortgage of at least
80% of the purchase price (or, for a self-build, 80% of the valuation approved
by the mortgage provider).</p>

<p>For new homes costing up to €400,000, a rebate of up to 5% of the purchase
price will be available. For homes costing between €400,000 and €600,000,
the maximum relief will be €20,000.</p>

<p>No relief will be available for homes costing more than €600,000.</p>

<p>This incentive will run until the end of 2019. It is intended to apply with
effect from 19 July 2016.</p>

<h4>Housing tax reliefs</h4>

<p>The <a href="../housing/housing_grants_and_schemes/home_renovation_incentive.html">Home
Renovation Incentive</a> is being extended until 31 December 2018.</p>

<p>The ceiling for exemption from income tax under the <a href="../housing/owning_a_home/home_owners/rent_a_room_scheme.html">Rent-
a-room relief</a> is being increased from €12,000 to €14,000 for 2017 and
subsequent years. This relief relates to income received from the letting of a
room or rooms in a principal private residence.</p>

<p><a href="../housing/renting_a_home/tax_relief_for_tenants.html">Rent tax
relief</a> will continue to be reduced, as announced in Budget 2011:</p>

<p><strong>Maximum qualifying amounts for 2017</strong></p>
<ul><li>Single under 55 years: €200</li>
  <li>Single over 55 years: €400</li>
  <li>Married or in a Civil Partnership, Widowed or a Surviving Civil Partner,
    under 55 years: €400</li>
  <li>Married or in a Civil Partnership, Widowed or a Surviving Civil Partner,
    over 55 years: €800</li>
</ul><p><a href="../housing/owning_a_home/buying_a_home/mortgage_interest_relief.html">Mortgage
interest relief</a>, which only applies to mortgages taken out by 31 December
2012, was due to end on 31 December 2017. It will now be retained beyond this
date, on a tapered basis. Details are to be announced in Budget 2018.</p>

<p>The previously announced rates and ceilings will apply in 2017 in accordance
with the <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/tax-relief-source-mortgage-rates.html">tables
published by Revenue</a>.</p>

<h4>Other property reliefs</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/living-city-initiative.html">Living
City Initiative</a> property tax incentive is being extended to landlords. For
residential applicants, the restriction on the maximum floor size is being
removed. The requirement for the property to have been previously used as a
dwelling is also being removed. The minimum amount of expenditure needed to
qualify is being reduced.</p>

<p><strong>Mortgage interest deductibility</strong> for landlords of
residential rental property is being increased from 75% to 80% with effect from
January 2017. This will apply to both new and existing mortgages.</p>

<h4>Student accommodation</h4>

<p>There will be new support from the <a href="http://www.isif.ie/">Ireland
Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF)</a> for investment in student accommodation.
Higher education Institutions will also be able to access <strong>low-cost loan
finance</strong> from the Housing Finance Agency.</p>

<p>It is intended that the increase of €2,000 in the ceiling for
<strong>Rent-a-room relief</strong> will help to increase the supply of
accommodation for students.</p>

<h4>Planning</h4>

<p><a href="../housing/planning_permission/an_bord_pleanala.html">An Bord
Pleanála</a> is to get extra funding to support the implementation of
fast-track measures for applications for large residential developments.</p>

<h4>Rental sector strategy</h4>

<p>A new <strong>strategy for the rental sector</strong> is due by end 2016.</p>

<h3>Employment and Business</h3>

<h4>Employees</h4>

<h4>Increase in minimum wage</h4>

<p>From 1 January 2017, the statutory <a href="../employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/pay_inc_min_wage.html">minimum
wage</a> will increase to €9.25 from €9.15 per hour.</p>

<h4>Small and medium businesses</h4>

<h4>CGT entrepreneur relief</h4>

<p>A reduced <a href="tax/capital_taxes/capital_gains_tax.html">Capital
Gains Tax</a> rate of 10% will apply to the disposal in whole or in part of a

gains.</p>

<h4>Earned income credit</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/about/foi/s16/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-44.pdf">Earned

taxpayers.</p>

<h4>Start Your Own Business Relief</h4>

<p>The <a href="tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/start_your_own_business_scheme.html">Start

in a tax year can claim a new income tax credit of €1,270 per annum.</p>

(SMEs) to be introduced in budget 2018.</p>

<h4>Other measures</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/foreign-earnings-deduction-fed.html">Foreign
Earnings Deduction</a> and the <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/sarp.html">Special Assignee
Relief</a> are being extended until the end of 2020.</p>

<h3>Education and Childcare</h3>

<h4>Childcare</h4>

<h4>Affordable Childcare Scheme</h4>

<p>From September 2017 a new <a href="https://www.dcya.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2Fearlyyears%2F20170412EarlyYearsFAQs.html&amp;mn=chiu3p&amp;nID=2">Single
Affordable Childcare Scheme</a> will provide a targeted subsidy, based on
parental income, for children aged between 6 months and 15 years and a
universal subsidy, for all families, for children aged between 6 months and 3
years.</p>

<p><strong>Targeted subsidy:</strong> The highest level of subsidy will be
provided to those on incomes up to €22,700 net per annum – this will be
approximately €8,000 a year, based on the maximum of 40-hours childcare a
week. The rate of subsidy will taper downwards as net income rises, with no
targeted subsidy payable when net income reaches €47,500. The income
thresholds increase if there is more than one child in the family.</p>

<p><strong>Universal subsidy:</strong> Up to €80 per month will be provided
towards childcare costs. This equates to over €900 per annum for parents
working full-time and will be paid pro-rata.</p>

<p>Both of these subsidies will be paid for children attending a
Tusla-registered childcare provider – including centre-based providers and
child minders.</p>

<h4>Pre-school education</h4>

<p>An additional €86 million has been provided for the full year costs of the
extended <a href="../education/pre_school_education_and_childcare/early_childhood_care_and_education_scheme.html">Early
Childhood Care and Education Scheme</a> and the rollout of the <a href="http://aim.gov.ie/">Access and Inclusion Model (AIM)</a> to enable
children with disabilities to access the scheme.</p>

<h4>Education</h4>

<h4>Primary and post-primary schools</h4>

<p>An additional 2,400 teaching posts in schools are to be funded in 2017
including:</p>
<ul><li>680 extra teachers</li>
  <li>900 extra resource teachers to support a new model of <a href="../education/the_irish_education_system/special_education.html">special
    education</a></li>
  <li>100 new posts for career guidance</li>
</ul><p>In addition, a further 115 Special Needs Assistants will be provided from
January 2017.</p>

<h4>Higher and further education</h4>

<p>In 2017, an additional €36.5 million will provide for over 179,000

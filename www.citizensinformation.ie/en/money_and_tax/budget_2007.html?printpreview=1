<h3>Health levy </h3>
<p>Threshold increased from €440 per week to €480 per week. Rate increased by 0.5% to 2.5% for earners whose income is in excess of €1,925 per week (€100,100 per annum) <br><br></p>
<h3>PRSI from 1 January 2007 <br></h3>
<p>The PRSI contribution ceiling for employees will increase from €46,600 to €48,800. <br>The employee weekly threshold for liability to PRSI will increase from €300 to €339.<br></p>
<h3>Mortgage interest relief</h3>
<p>The current annual ceiling on the amount of interest that can be allowed on a mortgage is being doubled for first-time buyers from €4,000/€8,000 single/married to €8,000/€16,000 single/married. </p>
<p>The increased relief will be available to all first-time buyers who are in the first seven years of their mortgage. <br><br>The ceiling for non-first-time buyers is also being increased, from €2,540/€5,080 single/married to €3,000/€6,000 single/married. <br></p>
<h3>Allowance for rent paid by certain tenants </h3>
<p>The maximum level of rent paid for private rented accommodation on which tax relief can be claimed, at the standard rate of tax, is being increased for those aged under 55 years of age, from €1,650 to €1,800 per annum for a single person and from €3,300 to €3,600 per annum for widowed and married persons. <br><br>This equates to a tax credit of €360 per annum for single persons and €720 for widowed and married persons. <br><br>For those aged 55 years and over, the maximum level of rent paid on which tax relief can be claimed is being increased from €3,300 to €3,600 per annum for a single person and from €6,600 to €7,200 per annum for widowed and married persons. <br><br>This equates to a tax credit of €720 per annum for a single person and €1,440 per annum for widowed and married persons. <br><br></p>
<h3>Childminding relief </h3>
<p>Budget 2006 introduced an exemption of up to €10,000 per annum on income from childminding where an individual minds up to three children, who are not their own, in the minder’s own home. If childminding income exceeds this the total amount is taxable, as normal, under self-assessment. The €10,000 limit is being increased to €15,000. <br><br></p>
<h3>Taxation of Jobseeker’s Benefit – systematic short-time workers </h3>
<p>The special tax exemption for Jobseeker’s Benefit paid to systematic short-time workers is being extended indefinitely. <br><br></p>
<h3>Rent-a-Room Scheme </h3>
<p>From 1 January 2007, it is proposed to close off use of the Rent-a-Room Scheme where the rent received is from connected persons who in turn are claiming rent relief. <br><br></p>
<h3>DIRT administration change </h3>
<p>DIRT can currently be refunded to an individual who is exempt from income tax if the person or the person’s spouse is over 65 years of age or permanently incapacitated. The rules relating to such individuals are now being changed so that in future they may notify their financial institution of their status and receive the interest without deduction of DIRT. These changes will be included in the 2007 Finance Bill. <br><br></p>
<h3>Administrative changes to help taxpayers claim reliefs </h3>
<p>A number of changes in administrative procedures are being introduced which will make it easier for taxpayers to claim reliefs to which they are entitled. For 2007 all age-related tax credits will, where possible, be credited automatically to the taxpayer where a verified date of birth can be established through Revenue or Social Welfare records. <br><br>A system will be implemented to credit tax relief on trade union subscriptions automatically, based on trade union membership lists.

Submissions are invited from interested parties by 1 March 2007. <br><br>Submissions are also being invited from interested parties, by 1 March 2007, in relation to the rebalancing of annual motor tax to provide an incentive for the motoring public to drive cleaner cars and to impose penalties in respect of cars with higher (CO2) emission levels. <br><br></p>

<h3>Extension of stamp duty relief for farm consolidation </h3>
<p>Stamp duty relief for exchanges of farmland between two farmers for the purposes of consolidating each farmer’s holdings was introduced on 1 July 2005 for a period of two years. The relief is being extended for a further two years to 30 June 2009. The relief will also be extended to qualifying exchanges of land where only one farmer is consolidating his/her holding. In such cases both farmers can qualify for relief, provided both farmers meet all other conditions of the relief. <br><br></p>

<p>An exemption from CGT applies in the case of individuals aged 55 and over who dispose of qualifying business or farming assets.

<h3>Capital Acquisitions Tax agricultural relief – off-farm principal private residences </h3>
<p>CAT agricultural relief provides relief from CAT on 90% of the value of a gift or inheritance. In order to qualify for the relief, 80% of a farmer’s total assets (after receipt of the gift/inheritance) must consist of qualifying agricultural assets. Off-farm principal private residences are not considered such assets for the purposes of this relief. This provision is now being amended so that an individual may off-set borrowings on an off-farm principal private residence against the property’s value, for the purpose of the 80% test. <br><br></p>
<h2>Capital Gains Tax </h2>
<h3>Increase in threshold for CGT retirement relief </h3>
<p>An exemption from CGT applies in the case of individuals aged 55 and over who dispose of qualifying business or farming assets subject to certain conditions.

<h3>New stamp duty exemption for sporting bodies </h3>
<p>A new exemption from stamp duty is being introduced for those sporting bodies covered by Section 235 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which are already entitled to relief from income tax and capital gains tax, subject to certain conditions.

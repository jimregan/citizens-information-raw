<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>For information on the budget announced on Tuesday, 13 October 2015, please visit our document on <a href="/en/money_and_tax/budget_2016.html">Budget 2016</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Budget 2015 was announced on 14 October 2014.</p>

<p>The main Budget changes that may affect people living in Ireland are set out
below. </p>

<p>This document sets out changes in the areas of taxation, social welfare,
health, housing, education, employment and other areas. It is an overview and
not a complete statement of the measures announced in Budget 2015.</p>

<p><strong>This document will be updated throughout the week as more details
become available.</strong></p>

<p>Some of the changes announced in the Budget come into effect immediately.
Others take effect from the beginning of January 2015 or in mid-2015. Many
others have to be finalised before coming into effect. </p>

<p>Some elements of these measures may change when the legislation required to
bring them into effect is enacted. </p>

<p>For a full list of the Budget changes, please see the Department of Finance
website, <a href="http://www.budget.gov.ie">budget.gov.ie</a>. You can find a
summary of the social welfare changes on the Department of Social Protection's
website, <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Budget-2015.aspx">welfare.ie</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l01933">Taxation</h2>

<h3>Income tax</h3>

<p>From January 2015 the <strong>standard rate tax band</strong> will increase
by €1,000: from €32,800 to €33,800 for single people and from €41,800
to €42,800 for married couples with one income. The higher rate of income tax
will reduce from 41% to 40%.</p>

<p>The threshold for exempt income under the <strong>rent-a-room
scheme</strong> is being increased to €12,000 per annum in 2015.</p>

<p>From 2015 <strong>tax relief on water charges</strong> at the standard rate
of 20% will be available, up to a maximum of €500 per annum (which means a
maximum €100 tax credit). This relief will be paid in arrears.</p>

<p>The <strong>Home Renovation Incentive</strong> is being extended to include
renovation and improvement of rental properties owned by landlords who pay
income tax.</p>

<p>The threshold for the <strong>artists’ exemption</strong> will be
increased by €10,000 to €50,000 in 2015. The exemption is also being
extended to non-resident artists (to people who are resident or ordinarily
resident in another EEA State).</p>

<p>The <strong>Seed Capital Scheme</strong> is being rebranded as "Start-Up
Relief for Entrepreneurs" (SURE) and being extended to people who have been
unemployed for up to 2 years.</p>

<h3>Universal Social Charge (USC)</h3>

<p>Incomes of €12,012 or less will be exempt from USC. Once your income is
over this limit, you pay the relevant rate of USC on all of your income.</p>

<table><caption>Proposed standard rate of USC (2015)</caption>
  <col><col><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rate</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Income band</strong></td>
    </tr><tr><td>1.5%</td>
      <td>Up to €12,012.00</td>

    </tr><tr><td>3.5%</td>
      <td>All income over €12,012.00</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>Reduced rates of USC apply to:</p>
<ul><li>People aged 70 or over whose aggregate income for the year is €60,000
    or less</li>
  <li>Medical card holders under 70 whose aggregate income for the year is
    €60,000 or less</li>
</ul><p>'Aggregate' income for USC purposes does not include payments from the
Department of Social Protection.</p>

<h3>Deposit Income Retention Tax (DIRT)</h3>

<p>A relief from DIRT on savings used by first time house buyers towards the
deposit on a home is being introduced.</p>

<h3>Valued Added Tax (VAT)</h3>

<p>The 9% rate of VAT is being retained for tourism-related activities.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2015, cross-border EU telecommunications, broadcasting and
electronically supplied services will be charged to VAT in the Member State of
the consumer and not the supplier. As a net recipient of these services, it is
estimated that Ireland will gain VAT revenues of €100m in 2015, rising to
€150m in 2019.</p>

<h3>Excise Duties </h3>

<p>The excise duty on a <strong>packet of 20 cigarettes</strong> is being
increased by 40 cent (including VAT) with a pro-rata increase on the other
tobacco products, with effect from midnight on 14 October 2014.</p>

<p>The excise duty on <strong>roll-your-own tobacco</strong> is being increased
by an additional 20 cent (including VAT) per 25g pouch with effect from
midnight on 14 October 2014.</p>

<p>The enactment of the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013 will allow for the
extension of <strong>Betting Duty</strong> to remote operators and betting
exchanges in 2015.</p>

<p>The <strong>Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT)</strong> reliefs available for
the purchase of hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles,
plug-in electric vehicles, and electric motorcycles are being extended to 31
December 2016.</p>

<p>The special relief reducing the standard rate of Alcohol Products Tax by 50%
on <strong>beers produced in microbreweries</strong> which produce not more
than 20,000 hectolitres per year is being extended to apply to microbreweries
which produce not more than 30,000 hectolitres per year.</p>

<p>A 30 day deferral of <strong>excise duty on mineral oil</strong> is provided
for. To allow for Revenue to revise the collection system, this measure will be
subject to a commencement order. This has an Exchequer cash-flow cost but does
not impact general government deficit.</p>

<p>The excise rate for <strong>Natural Gas and BioGas as a propellant</strong>
will be set at the current EU Minimum rate and this rate will be held for a
period of 8 years.</p>

<h3>Capital Gains Tax</h3>

<p>The <strong>property purchase incentive relief</strong> from CGT (for the
first 7 years of ownership) for properties purchased between 7 December 2011
and 31 December 2014 is not being extended beyond 31 December 2014. Where
property purchased in this period is held for seven years the gains accrued in
that period will not attract CGT.</p>

<p><strong>Windfall tax provisions</strong> introduced in 2009 which apply an
80% rate of tax to certain profits or gains from land disposals or land
development, where those profits or gains are attributable to a relevant
planning decision by a planning authority, are being abolished from 1 January
2015.</p>

<h3>Corporation Tax </h3>

<p>The 25% <strong>R&amp;D tax credit</strong> applies to the amount of
qualifying R&amp;D expenditure incurred by a company in a given year that is in
excess of the amount spent in 2003. This 2003 base year restriction is now
being removed from 1 January 2015.</p>

<p>The current restrictions on <strong>capital allowances for the provision of
specified intangible assets</strong> will be removed.</p>

<p>The <strong>accelerated capital allowances for energy efficient
equipment</strong> were due to expire at the end of 2014. Following a review by
the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, this measure is
being extended to the end of 2017.</p>

<h3>Agri-Taxation Review / Farming Measures</h3>

<p><strong>Income tax</strong> measures for farmers include:</p>
<ul><li>Increase the amounts of income exempted from long term leasing by 50% and
    introduce a 4th threshold for lease periods of 15 or more years with income
    of up to €40,000 being exempted</li>
  <li>Allow relief where the lessee is a company</li>
  <li>Remove the 40 years of age threshold for leasing relief</li>
  <li>Allow income averaging where there is on-farm diversification</li>
  <li>Increase income averaging from 3 to 5 years</li>
</ul><p>The <strong>VAT flat-rate scheme</strong> compensates unregistered farmers
for VAT incurred on their farming inputs. The flat-rate addition will be
increased from 5% to 5.2% from 1 January 2015. The flat-rate addition is
reviewed annually in accordance with the EU VAT Directive and the increase to
5.2% in 2015 continues to achieve full compensation for farmers.</p>

<p><strong>Farm restructuring CGT relief</strong> is available where the first
transaction in the restructuring (e.g. sale, purchase or exchange of land) is
carried out by 31 December 2015 with the restructuring to be completed within
24 months. The deadline for the completion of the first restructuring
transaction is being extended to 31 December 2016.</p>

<p>Teagasc certification guidelines are being amended to enable whole farm
replacement to be eligible for the farm restructuring relief subject to meeting
the conditions laid down by Teagasc.</p>

<p><strong>CGT retirement relief</strong> is being amended so that, subject to
other conditions, land that has been leased for up to 25 years in total
(increased from 15) ending with disposal will qualify for the relief.</p>

<p>Amendments to CGT retirement relief are also being made to provide (in the
case of land disposals outside the family) that land currently let under
conacre arrangements which end with disposal on or before 31 December 2016 or
which (before 31 December 2016) is instead leased out for minimum periods of 5
years to a maximum of 25 years ending with disposal will, subject to other
conditions, also qualify for CGT retirement relief.</p>

<p>Changes are being introduced to target <strong>CAT agricultural
relief</strong> to active farmers. From 1 January 2015, and subject to other
conditions, the relief will be available only in respect of agricultural
property gifted to or inherited by active farmers and to people who are not
active farmers but who lease out the property on a long-term basis for
agricultural use to such farmers.</p>

<p>Agricultural leases of between 5 and 35 years in duration to active farmers
will be exempt from <strong>stamp duty</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Consanguinity relief</strong>, which applies to transfers of
non-residential property to certain relatives, is due to expire on 31 December
2014. This relief, which halves the applicable rate of stamp duty, will be
extended for a period of 3 years in certain circumstances where the transferor
is 65 years or under and the transferee is an active farmer.</p>

<p>Total social welfare expenditure in 2015 will be €19.415 billion. There
are no changes to the rates of primary weekly social welfare payments and
pensions. </p>

<h3>Return to work supports</h3>

<p>The Department of Social Protection will spend over €1.1 billion on
employee and employer supports in 2015. A Low Pay Commission will be
established in 2015.</p>

<h4>Back to Work Family Dividend</h4>

<p>A new Back to Work Family Dividend will be introduced for lone parent and
long-term jobseeker families with children who find or return to work from
January 2015.</p>

<p>This will also apply to lone parent and long-term jobseeker families with
children who start or return to self-employment.</p>

<p>The Qualified Child Increase of €29.80 per week will be paid in full for
the first year in employment and half that amount will be paid weekly for the
second year. This amounts to €1,550 per child in Year 1 and €775 in Year
2.</p>

<p>The Back to Work Family Dividend will be paid in addition to any entitlement
the family may have under the Family Income Supplement (FIS) scheme and will
not affect the level of the FIS payment.</p>

<h4>JobsPlus</h4>

<p>There will be a doubling of JobsPlus places from 3,000 to 6,000 to
incentivise employers to hire long-term unemployed people from the Live
Register. Employers can receive up to €10,000 in monthly cash grants over 2
years for each eligible employee.</p>

<p>A new JobsPlus strand for young people will be launched in 2015 under the
Youth Guarantee.</p>

<h4>JobPath</h4>

<p>€12 million will be provided for the new employment activation programme
JobPath.</p>

<h3>Payments to families and children</h3>

<p>An extra €2 million will be provided for the Department of Social
Protection’s School Meals Programme in 2015. This funding will be used to
increase funding to existing DEIS schools. Over €349 million will be provided
for Family Income Supplement (FIS) in 2015.</p>

<p>The rate of <strong>Child Benefit</strong> will increase by €5 to €135
per month for each child from January 2015. It is proposed that it will
increase by a further €5 in 2016. This will cost €1.97 billion in 2015 and
will benefit 613,000 families.</p>

which only applies to mortgages taken out by 31 December 2012. The previously
announced rates and ceilings will apply in 2015 in accordance with the <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/tax-relief-source-mortgage-rates.html">tables

extended to new start-ups in 2015. A review of the operation of this measure
will take place in 2015. </p>

<p>Funding for <strong>Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs)</strong> has been
increased. It is expected this will help the LEOs to support the creation of up
to 1,600 new jobs, to provide Start Your Own Business courses to over 3,000
participants and to assign almost 2,800 mentors to their clients in 2015.
Funding of €3 million has also been allocated to a Trading Online Programme.

  <li>The number of days that employees are required to be abroad in a year is
    being reduced to 40 days</li>
  <li>Travel time will be included as time spent in a country to make it easier
    for smaller companies to send employees on trade missions and the minimum
    stay in a country is reduced to 3 days</li>
</ul><p>Research and development funding provision of €250 million for Enterprise
Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland in 2015.</p>

<h3>Supports for unemployed people </h3>

<p><strong>JobsPlus</strong>: The number of positions for long-term unemployed
people on the JobsPlus scheme is being doubled to 6,000. In addition, a new
JobsPlus strand for young people will be launched early in 2015 under the Youth
Guarantee.</p>

<p>The <strong>Seed Capital Scheme</strong> is being rebranded as "Start-Up
Relief for Entrepreneurs" (SURE) and being extended to people who have been
unemployed for up to 2 years.</p>

<p>In 2015 the <strong>Pathways to Work strategy</strong> will be supported by
€1.6 billion and will be made available to provide approximately 300,000 work
and training places.</p>

<p>The <strong>JobPath</strong> initiative has been allocated €12 million in
2015. This will match long-term unemployed people with appropriate training and
employment opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>Community Employment (CE)</strong> will be given almost €16
million in additional funding and total funding of €373 million for 25,500
places in 2015, including:</p>
<ul><li>€29 million for 2,200 places on the new 3-year community-based
    childcare programme</li>
  <li>€15 million for over 1,000 places on the Drug Rehabilitation
  Schemes</li>
  <li>Roll-out of the new Health and Social Care programme</li>
</ul><p>The <strong>Local Community Development Programme</strong> supporting
one-to-one labour market training for 10,000 people who are distanced from the
labour market will end in Q1 2015. Its successor, the <strong>Social Inclusion
and Community Activation Programme (SICAP)</strong> will support a further
30,000 people in 2015. €46 million is being invested to increase access to
formal and informal educational activities and resources, and to increase
people’s work readiness and employment prospects.</p>

<h3>Education and Training </h3>

<p>The <strong>pupil/teacher ratio</strong> in all schools will remain
unchanged.</p>

<p><strong>New education posts</strong> will be created. There will be 900 new
classroom teachers, 480 new resource teachers and 365 new Special Needs
Assistant (SNA) posts. Of the 365 new SNA posts, 145 will be in place by the
end of 2014 and 220 posts will follow in 2015.</p>

<h4>Early childhood education inspectors</h4>

<p>Recruitment of new early childhood education inspectors will begin in
2014.</p>

<h4>Further education and training</h4>

<p>270,000 further education and training places will be maintained.</p>

<h4>Student Grant</h4>

<p>Under the Student Grant Scheme, students will get 4 months of maintenance
payments before the end of December and 5 months of payments in the following
year (from the 2015–2016 academic year). Currently, 3 months of payments are
made before the end of December and 6 months of payments are made the following
year. This measure is to reduce financial difficulties experienced by students
due to the fact that the academic year now starts earlier in many higher
education institutions.</p>

<h4>Institutes of technology</h4>

<p>€10 million will be invested in facilities and equipment in Institutes of
Technology in 2015.</p>

<h4>Capital projects</h4>

<p><strong>Schools</strong>: The 2015 Large Scale Projects Programme will be
announced later this year. It is expected that over 50 large scale school
projects will reach substantial completion in 2015. School places will also be
delivered by the Additional Accommodation Scheme.</p>

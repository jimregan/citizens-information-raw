<h1>Income Tax</h1>

<h3>Restriction of reliefs </h3>

<p>The restriction of income tax relief for high income earners* is being
amended for 2010 and subsequent tax years to achieve an effective rate of
income tax of 30% for people who were subject to the full restriction. PRSI and
relevant levies will also apply. The entry level threshold for the restriction
will now occur at adjusted income levels of €125,000 (was €250,000) and the
full restriction will apply at €400,000 (was €500,000). </p>

<p>*This restriction of relief measure was introduced in Budget 2006, and came
into operation from 1 January 2007. It limits the use of tax breaks by those
with high incomes. It is based on restricting the amount of specified reliefs
which a person can use to reduce their tax bill in any one year. </p>

<h3>New Irish domicile levy</h3>

<p>All Irish nationals and Irish-domiciled people with a worldwide income of
over €1 million and Irish-located capital of over €5 million will pay a new
Irish domicile levy of €200,000. This levy applies regardless of where the
person is tax resident. No date has been set for the introduction of these
measures yet. </p>

<h1>Other Income Tax</h1>

<h3>Mortgage Interest Relief</h3>

<p>Qualifying loans taken out before 1 July 2011 will continue to get relief
for 7 years. Transitional measures will be provided for qualifying loans taken

<p>People whose entitlement to relief is due to expire in 2010 or after,
continue to qualify for relief at the applicable rate up until the end of 2017.
</p>

<p>Mortgage Interest Relief will be abolished entirely by the end of 2017. </p>

<p>Relief from the income levy will be allowed for certain expenditure incurred
by farmers to comply with the requirements of the EU Nitrates Directive
91/676/EEC. </p>

<h3>Announcement on reform of income tax system in 2011</h3>

<p>The Minister for Finance announced that a new system of two charges on
income would be introduced in 2011. </p>

<p>A new Universal Social Contribution will replace employee PRSI, the health
levy and the income levy. It will be paid by everyone at a low rate on a wide
base as a collective contribution to public services. </p>

<p>Income tax will apply on a progressive basis to those with higher incomes.
</p>

<h3>Proposed property tax and water charges</h3>

<p>The Minister for Finance indicated that work will begin on registration of
ownership and valuation of land in preparation for a site valuation tax. A

</p>

<p>The supply teacher scheme at primary level will cease from the start of the
2010/11 school year. Normal substitution arrangements which apply to primary
schools generally to cover teacher absences will be used to cover substitution

sick leave days allowed in the school year for teachers in primary, secondary
and community and comprehensive schools will be reduced to 7 days. This is the
same number of days available for teachers in vocational schools and community
colleges. </p>

<h3>School transport</h3>

<p>The provision for school transport will be €188m compared with a 2009
estimated out-turn of €178m. While efficiencies made during 2009 will
continue to yield savings in 2010, an increase of €10m will be provided which
includes provision for new services as necessary. </p>

    creates a new job and takes on a person who has been unemployed for 6
    months or more, the employer will be fully exempted from the liability to
    pay PRSI for the first year of that employment. This will give employers an
    8%-10% saving on employment costs for each new job created. Full details
    will be announced early in 2010. </li>

<h3>Pensions </h3>

<p>A new single scheme will be introduced for all new entrants to the public
service from 2010 onwards. Main provisions include:</p>

</p>

<p>For existing public servants retiring after 2010, the Minister may bring
forward further proposals as part of the legislation introducing the single new
scheme. </p>

    entitlement to a State Pension </li>

    such as added years, will be generally discontinued </li>
</ul><p>These terms to apply to the President, Oireachtas members, the judiciary and
the Attorney General. </p>

<p>Any retirements in 2010 will be on existing pay terms before the reductions
announced in this Budget. <br><br></p>

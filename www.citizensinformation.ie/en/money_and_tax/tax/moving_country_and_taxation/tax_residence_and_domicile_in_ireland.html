<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>
Your liability for tax in Ireland can be affected by whether you are resident
in the country and whether Ireland is your permanent home. There is a specific
definition of residence for tax purposes depending on how many days you spend
in the country. If you are not resident in a particular year, Ireland can still
be your ‘ordinary residence’ since this term refers to the country where
you are usually resident over a number of years. The country that is your
permanent home is known as your <em>domicile</em>.<br></div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l45a4c">Residence for tax purposes</h2>

<p>Your residence for tax purposes depends on the number of days that you are
present in Ireland during a tax year (A <em>tax year</em> means the period from
1 January to 31 December). </p>

<p>You are resident for tax purposes for a year if:</p>
<ul><li>You spend 183 days or more in Ireland in that year from 1 January – 31
    December or, </li>
  <li>If you spend 280 days or more in Ireland over a period of two consecutive
    tax years, you will be regarded as resident for the second tax year. For
    example, if you spend 140 days here in Year 1 and 150 days here in Year 2,
    you will be resident in Ireland for Year 2.</li>
</ul><p>For tax years up to 2008, each day you are present at midnight counts as one
day in the calculation of residency for tax purposes. From tax year 2009
onwards, the midnight rule no longer applies, and you are treated as being
present in the State, if you are present in the State at any time during that
day.</p>

<h2>Electing to be resident for tax purposes</h2>

<p>If you arrive in Ireland in a particular year but are not present for the
required number of days, you may elect to be resident for that year provided
that you will be resident in the following year. Contact your local tax office
for details.</p>

<h2>Ordinary residence</h2>

<p>Your pattern of residence over a number of years is taken into account to
decide your ‘ordinary residence’. <br>
If you have been resident for the previous three tax years then you become
ordinarily resident from the start of the fourth year. If you leave the
country, you will continue to be ordinarily resident until you have been
non-resident for three continuous tax years.</p>

<h2>Residence and married couples or civil partners</h2>

<p>For a married couple or civil partners, the residence status of each spouse
is assessed independently of the other so it is possible for one spouse or
civil partner to be resident and the other to be non-resident. If your
residence status differs from that of your spouse or civil partner, you can
choose to be treated as single people for tax purposes if it is more
beneficial.</p>

<p>If you are resident and employed in Ireland but your spouse or civil partner
is not resident in Ireland and has no income - so that your earnings are the
only source of income - then it may be possible to claim the <a href="../income_tax/taxation_of_married_people.html">Married or Civil
Partner's Tax Credit</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/income_tax/how_your_tax_is_calculated.html">increased
tax rate band</a>.</p>

<h2>What is domicile in Ireland?</h2>

<p>Your domicile is the country where you live with the intention of remaining
there permanently. It may be different to your residence or nationality.</p>

<p>When you are born, you have a <em>domicile of origin</em>. This is usually
the domicile of your father unless your parents have not married or you live
with your mother only. This provision is set down in Irish law in the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1986/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Domicile
and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986.</a></p>

<p>This domicile can be changed to a <em>domicile of choice,</em> if you move
to a different country with the intention of living there permanently.</p>

<h3>Irish domicile levy</h3>

<p>A Irish domicile levy was introduced in 2010. This levy applies regardless
of where you are tax resident. The levy is charged on an individual:</p>
<ul><li>Who in any year is Irish domiciled</li>
  <li>Whose worldwide income in the year exceeds €1m</li>
  <li>Whose Irish-located property in the year is greater than €5m, and</li>
  <li>Whose liability to Irish income tax for the year is less than
  €200,000</li>
</ul><p>The levy is €200,000 and is payable annually. Any Irish income tax paid by
you in a tax year is allowed as a credit when calculating the amount of
domicile levy due for that year. The levy is payable each year on or before 31
October in the year following the valuation date (on a self-assessment basis).
The valuation date is 31 December each year. The levy for the year 2014 is,
therefore, due and payable on or before 31 October 2015. You can get <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/domicile-levy/index.html">more information
about the domicile levy from the Revenue Commissioners</a>.</p>

<p>The citizenship condition for payment of the levy was removed in 2012. This
means that liable non-residents cannot avoid the levy by changing their
citizenship status. Before 2012 the levy only applied to Irish citizens. </p>

<h2>Tax implications</h2>

<p>Residence and domicile are taken into account for a number of taxes
including <a shape="rect" href="../income_tax/how_your_tax_is_calculated.html">income tax</a>, Deposit
Interest Retention Tax, <a shape="rect" href="../capital_taxes/capital_acquisitions_tax.html">gift tax</a>, <a shape="rect" href="../capital_taxes/capital_acquisitions_tax.html">inheritance

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Financial service providers such as banks, building societies and post
offices, offer accounts where you can save a sum of money (a deposit) for which
they will pay you an annual rate of interest in return, usually as a percentage
of the deposit.</p>

<p>The interest you receive is subject to a tax called Deposit Interest
Retention Tax (DIRT). </p>

<p>Since <strong>1 January 2014</strong>, DIRT is charged at
<strong>41%</strong> on all interest payments. For 2013, the rates were 33% for
ordinary deposit accounts and 36% for long-term deposit accounts. <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/dirt/index.html">You can see historic DIRT
rates on revenue.ie</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Budget 2017:</strong> The rate of Deposit Interest Retention Tax
will decrease by 2% each year for the next 4 years until it reaches 33%. A
reduced rate of 39% applies to interest paid or credited on or after 1 January
2017.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The tax is deducted by the bank or other deposit-taker before the interest
is paid to you. If you request it, you are entitled to be given a statement of
the amount of DIRT deducted from your interest. If you receive annual interest
payments (or similar profit-type payments) of over €300 your bank, building
society, credit union or An Post must automatically report this to Revenue. </p>

<p>DIRT is a final liability for income tax purposes. This means that if you
have paid DIRT you do not have to pay any further income tax or Universal
Social Charge on the interest but it is declared as income if you are making a
tax return. <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">However,
in some circumstances, you may have to pay PRSI on deposit interest you have
received</a>. </p>

<p>DIRT does not apply to interest on deposits owned by: </p><ul><li>Companies that are liable to corporation tax</li>
  <li>Charities</li>
  <li>People not resident for tax in Ireland (see also below)</li>
  <li>Revenue-approved pension schemes</li>
</ul></div>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l6da94">Exemptions and refunds</h2>

<p>Certain people may qualify for a refund of DIRT or may have their deposit
interest paid without the deduction of DIRT. You must apply to have your
deposit interest paid without the deduction of DIRT - see 'Where to apply'
below.</p>

<h3>First-time buyers</h3>

<p>First-time buyers who buy or self-build a house or apartment to live in as
their home may be able to claim a refund of the DIRT paid on their savings.</p>

<p>If you buy or self-build a property between 14 October 2014 and 31 December
2017, you may be entitled to claim a refund of DIRT. You must be a first-time
buyer. This means that you have never, either individually or jointly with any
other person, previously purchased or built a house or apartment. The property
must be purchased or built as your home. The relief does not include properties
acquired for investment purposes.</p>

<p>You can claim a refund of any DIRT deducted from interest earned on savings
used for the purchase of a property or a self-build in the 48 months prior to
the purchase date (date of conveyance).</p>

<p>You can only claim relief on DIRT paid on savings up to a maximum of 20% of
the purchase price or in the case of self-builds, 20% of the completion value
of the property.</p>

on the exemption</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>People aged over 65</h3>

<p>You can get your deposit interest paid without the deduction of DIRT, or you
can claim a DIRT refund, if you are over 65 and:</p>
<ul><li>Your income (including your spouse's or civil partner's income) is less
    than the <a shape="rect" href="../income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/older_peoples_tax_credits_and_reliefs.html">low
    income exemption limits for people aged over 65</a> <strong>or</strong>
  </li>
  <li>Your tax liability (including your spouse's or civil partner's income)
    for the year is less than your tax credits (including your spouse's) for
    that year. </li>
</ul><p>In general, joint accounts where one of the account holders is aged 65 or
over will only qualify for the refund of DIRT if the other account holder is
that person’s spouse or civil partner. </p>

<p>However, if another person, such as your son or daughter, has the authority
to operate your bank account on your behalf, and is named as an account holder
for this purpose only, you will continue to qualify for the refund of DIRT
provided you are the beneficial owner of the account. In this case, when
claiming a refund of DIRT, you must include a declaration that you (not your
child) are entitled to all of the interest paid in respect of the deposit. </p>

<h3>People with disabilities</h3>

<p>You can get your deposit interest paid without the deduction of DIRT or a
DIRT refund, if you are: </p>
<ul><li>Permanently incapacitated from maintaining yourself <strong>and</strong>
  </li>
  <li>Your tax credits (including your spouse's) for the year exceed the tax
    that would be chargeable on your (and your spouse's) income for the year
  </li>
</ul><p><a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/dirt/leaflets/de2.html">You can get
more information on "DIRT-free Deposit Accounts for Permanently Incapacitated
Individuals - DE2" from Revenue</a>. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2>Non-resident accounts</h2>

<p>If you are not resident in Ireland for tax, you may get a refund of any
Deposit Interest Retention Tax deducted from your Irish deposit interest. To
get a refund of DIRT, Ireland must have a double taxation agreement with the
country you are resident in. DIRT will be refunded under the terms of that
agreement. Fill in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/forms/ic5.pdf">IC5 form (pdf)</a> to
apply for a refund of DIRT.</p>

<p>If you are not <a shape="rect" href="../moving_country_and_taxation/tax_residence_and_domicile_in_ireland.html">resident</a>
in Ireland, you may get your Irish deposit interest paid without the deduction
of DIRT. A non-resident person does not have to be a resident of a country that
has a double taxation agreement with Ireland to apply for a DIRT exemption. You
should contact your financial institution to find out if you can be exempt from
paying DIRT. You will have to complete a Non-Residence Declaration. You must
notify them if you become resident again.</p>
</div>

<h2>Credit unions</h2>

<p>Since 1 January 2014, all credit union share dividend and deposit interest
paid to members is subject to DIRT, with the exception of dividend or interest
paid to members who are exempt from DIRT (certain people over aged 65 and
certain people who are permanently incapacitated). Before 2014 certain types of
credit union accounts were not subject to DIRT. </p>

<p>Special term share credit union accounts opened in the period 1 January 2002
to 15 October 2013 allowed a member of a credit union to opt to hold shares in
the account for a minimum term of either 3 or 5 years. A tax exemption applied
to dividends from these accounts. This tax exemption was:</p>
<ul><li>For the first €480 per annum of dividends where the funds are invested
    for a minimum of 3 years, and</li>
  <li>For the first €635 per annum of dividends where the funds are invested
    for a minimum of 5 years.</li>
</ul><p>These accounts can no longer be opened, since 16 October 2013. However if
you had one of these accounts and the funds in the account mature after 16
October 2013, the tax exemption on dividends is still available. The remainder
is liable to the appropriate rate of DIRT (41% since 1 January 2014).</p>

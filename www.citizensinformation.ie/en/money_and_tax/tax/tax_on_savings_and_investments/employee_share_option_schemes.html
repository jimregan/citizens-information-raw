<p>In Ireland, employees can avail of certain share options from their company
that may be 'tax free' or 'tax efficient'. However, it is useful to bear in
mind that there are few benefits employees can receive that are completely 'tax
free'.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There are two main ways an employee can benefit from shares in the
company:</p>
<ul><li>Approved Profit Sharing Schemes </li>
  <li>Stock Options </li>
</ul></div>
Budget 2011 made a number of changes to the tax treatment of gains arising from
various types of share schemes, including making such gains chargeable to the
Universal Social Charge (USC) and PRSI. <div class="topic base_rules">

<h3>Approved Profit Sharing Schemes </h3>

<p>Approved Profit Sharing Schemes allow an employer to give an employee shares
in the company up to a maximum value of €12,700 per year tax-free. Approved
Profit Sharing Schemes are subject to certain conditions set out in legislation
and administered by the Revenue Commissioners. </p>

<p>Providing the scheme meets the required conditions, an employee will pay no
tax on shares up to a maximum value of €12,700 per year. The employer must
hold the shares for a period of time (called the "retention period") and the
employee must not dispose of the shares before three years. If an employee
disposes of shares before this time, he or she is liable to pay income tax on
whichever is the lower of the following:</p>
<ul><li>The market value of the shares when they were given to the employee or,
  </li>
  <li>The value of the shares at the time of sale </li>
</ul><p><span>Approved Profit Sharing Schemes are subject to a number of conditions
that should be checked with the Revenue Commissioners. </span>More information
can be found in Revenue's publication <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it62.pdf">Approved Profit
Sharing Schemes IT62 (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Stock options in your employer's company</h3>

<p><span>Revenue approved Savings-related Share Option Schemes allow you to
save for and purchase share options in your employer's company tax effectively.
You should check with the Revenue Commissioners and your employer as to what
rules apply to your share options and when you are liable to pay tax.</span>

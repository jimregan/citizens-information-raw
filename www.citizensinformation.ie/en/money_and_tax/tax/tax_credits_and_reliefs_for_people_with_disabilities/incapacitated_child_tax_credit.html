<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>You can claim an Incapacitated Child Tax Credit if you are the parent or
guardian of a child who is permanently incapacitated, either physically or
mentally and</p>
<ul><li>Became so before reaching 21 years of age <strong>or</strong> </li>
</ul><ul><li>Becomes permanently incapacitated after reaching the age of 21, but while
    still in full-time education or while training for a trade or profession
    for a minimum of 2 years. </li>
</ul><p>You can also claim the credit for:</p>
<ul><li>A stepchild </li>
  <li>An adopted child </li>
  <li>Any child of whom you have custody, who is maintained at your own expense
    and who is permanently incapacitated
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ul></div>
You can claim a credit for more than one child where more than one child is
permanently incapacitated. 

<p>Where the child is maintained by one parent only, that parent is entitled to
claim the full amount of the tax credit. However, where the child is maintained
by more than one person, the tax credit is divided between them in proportion
to the amount paid by each towards the maintenance of the child. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lef184">Qualifying disabilities</h2>

<p>Disabilities regarded as permanently incapacitating are: </p>
<ul><li>Cystic Fibrosis </li>
  <li>Spina Bifida </li>
  <li>Blindness </li>
  <li>Deafness </li>
  <li>Down Syndrome </li>
  <li>Spastic paralysis </li>
  <li>Certain forms of schizophrenia </li>
  <li>Acute autism </li>
</ul><p>This is not an exhaustive list. </p>

<p>A credit is not due where the child is fully maintained at public or
charitable expense.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You use this <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/forms/incapacitated-child-tax-credit.pdf">claim
form (pdf)</a> to claim the Incapacitated Child Tax Credit. You can also claim
the credit through PAYE Anytime which is available through <a href="https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html">Revenue's myAccount
service</a>. </p>

<p>In some cases (where it is not obvious that the child’s incapacity is of a
serious and permanent nature) you need to submit a doctor’s certificate with
your initial claim. The doctor’s certificate should state:</p>
<ul><li>The date the incapacity first arose </li>
  <li>The degree and extent of the incapacity </li>
  <li>If it is a disability other than one of those listed above, whether the
    incapacity permanently prevents the child from maintaining his or herself.
  </li>
</ul></div>

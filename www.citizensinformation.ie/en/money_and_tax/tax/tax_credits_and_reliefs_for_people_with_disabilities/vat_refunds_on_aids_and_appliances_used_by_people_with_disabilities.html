<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you live in Ireland and you have a disability, you may get a refund of <a shape="rect" href="../duties_and_vat/value_added_tax.html">Value-Added Tax
(<acronym title="Value Added Tax">VAT</acronym>)</a> on certain special aids
and appliances that you need. In some cases people who pay for aids and
appliances that are for the exclusive use of a person with a disability can
also claim the VAT refund. People with both physical and mental disabilities
can avail of these refunds. </p>

<p>This scheme of VAT refunds on aids and appliances can also apply to
adaptation and installation work being carried out to make a home more suitable
for an older person or for a person with a disability – see ‘Housing
adaptations’ below. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1981/si/428/made/en/print">Value-Added
Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 15) Order 1981</a>, you can claim a VAT refund on aids
and appliances that help you carry out daily activities at home or at work. You
may need to produce medical evidence of your disability.</p>

<p>VAT refunds are <strong>not</strong> allowed on services for people with
disabilities or on rented aids and appliances.</p>

<p>To claim a VAT refund you must:</p>
<ul><li>Live in Ireland</li>
  <li>Have a disability</li>
  <li>Need the aid or appliance to help with daily activities</li>
</ul><p>The aid or appliance must be owned by the person with the disability and be
for their exclusive use. If the VAT refund is being sought by someone other
than the user of the aid or appliance, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie">Revenue</a> may ask for evidence that the aid is
solely owned by the person with the disability and is for their sole use. In
this case, these goods must <strong>not</strong> be supplied in the course of a
business run by the purchaser of the goods. </p>

<p>Examples of eligible aids and appliances include:</p>
<ul><li>Domestic aids, for example, eating and drinking aids </li>
  <li>Walk-in baths </li>
  <li>Commode chairs </li>
  <li>Lifting seats and specified chairs </li>
  <li>Braille books </li>
  <li>Hoists and lifts, including stair lifts</li>
  <li>Communication aids</li>
</ul><p><a href="http://www.assistireland.ie/eng/">Assist Ireland</a> has
information on a wide range of aids and appliances for people with
disabilities.</p>

<h3>Housing adaptations</h3>

<p>If you are having your home improved or adapted to make it more accessible,
you may be able to claim a refund of VAT paid on the cost of installation and
adaptation work. You may also qualify for a grant, such as the <a href="../../../housing/housing_grants_and_schemes/housing_adaptation_grant_for_people_with_disability.html">Housing
Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability</a>, the <a href="../../../housing/housing_grants_and_schemes/mobility_aids_grant_scheme.html">Mobility
Aids Grant Scheme</a> or the <a href="../../../housing/housing_grants_and_schemes/housing_aid_for_older_persons_scheme.html">Housing
Aid for Older People Scheme</a>. Read more about <a href="../../../housing/housing_grants_and_schemes">housing grants and

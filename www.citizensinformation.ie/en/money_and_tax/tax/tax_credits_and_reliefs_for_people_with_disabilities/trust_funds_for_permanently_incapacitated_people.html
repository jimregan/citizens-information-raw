<p>You can set up trust funds from the proceeds of public subscriptions to
benefit those who are permanently and totally incapacitated. ("Permanently
incapacitated" means the beneficiary of the fund is totally and permanently
unable to maintain themselves as a result of physical or mental infirmity.
Their incapacity may have occurred as the result of an accident, illness,
progressive disorder or similar disability.) </p>

<p>Sometimes following an accident, illness, etc. the family, friends or
colleagues of someone who is or has become permanently incapacitated may run
some events to help raise money for the benefit of the disabled or
incapacitated person. The money that is then raised from these events, may be
held in trust for the permanently incapacitated individual and used for their
benefit throughout their life. For example, funds may be used to pay for health
treatment, a holiday, specialised equipment or a carer for the beneficiary. </p>

<p>Under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1999/en/act/pub/0002/sec0012.html#parti-chapii-sec12">Section
12 of the Finance Act 1999</a>, certain trust funds established for the benefit
of this person may be exempt from income tax.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Trust funds</h3>

<p>A trust is a legally enforceable (agreement) that is established between the
trustees of the fund and the beneficiary or beneficiaries. The trustees are the
administrators (or custodians) of the fund and their role is to maintain and
operate the assets of the trust for the benefit of the beneficieries. The
beneficiary (or beneficiaries), is the permanently incapacitated person who
benefits from the funds raised on their behalf. Trustees <span>cannot have any
connection with the beneficiary.</span> (In other words, they cannot be family
members or spouses of the beneficiary. They must remain independent and
objective in decisions arising from the operation of the trust to ensure they
act in the best interest of the beneficiary). </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Public subscriptions</h3>

<p>Funds raised from public subscriptions generally mean monies raised from a
public appeal or a charitable event. To avail of the tax exemptions, the trust
must be set up under specific conditions as follows: </p>
<ul><li>The trust must only be for the benefit of the named individual(s) for the
    person's lifetime. The individual(s) must be permanently and totally
    incapacitated. In other words, the person must suffer from a physical or
    mental infirmity which results in them being unable to maintain themselves.
  </li>
  <li>Trustees must have <span>no connection with the permanently incapacitated
    individual</span> </li>
  <li>The funds of the trust must be created by public subscriptions. This
    means that a public appeal must be made inviting subscriptions. If the
    total subscriptons exceed €381,000, no single individual can contribute
    more than 30% of the total. </li>
  <li>The trustees hold in trust for the individual, funds that are to be
    applied for the benefit of the named individuals</li>
  <li>If the individual is to be exempt from tax the money from the trust fund
    must be their sole or main source of income. Income from social welfare
    payments is not counted when deciding if the trust fund is the main source
    of income. </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/practitioner/ebrief/archive/2015/no-232015.html">Section
    10 of Finance Act 2014 amended the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to allow
    the undistributed part of the trust funds on the death of an incapacitated
    person</a> (or of the last surviving incapacitated person) to be part of
    the person’s estate if they have a surviving spouse, civil partner or
    child. Previously, the undistributed trust funds at the date of death had
    to be used for charitable purposes or appointed in favour of the trustees
    of charitable bodies. This still applies if there is no surviving spouse,
    civil partner or child. </li>
</ul><h3>Tax exemptions</h3>

<p>Trust funds set up for the benefit of a permanently incapacitated person(s)
allow both the trustees and the incapacitated individual(s) to avail of certain
tax exemptions. The following is a summary of the tax exemptions: </p>
<ul><li>The trustees of a qualifying trust are exempt from income tax in respect
    of income they receive from the investment of the trust funds. </li>
  <li>The trustees are entitled to reclaim any <a href="../tax_on_savings_and_investments/deposit_interest_retention_tax.html">Deposit
    Interest Retention Tax (DIRT)</a> paid by them on or after 6 April 1997.
  </li>
  <li>The incapacitated individual is exempt from tax in respect of payments
    made by the trustees to or for his/her benefit. They are also exempt from
    tax on income from the investment of payments. </li>
</ul><h3>Applying for tax exemption</h3>

<p>The incapacitated person or persons receiving income and the trustees must
declare this income to the Revenue Commissioners when making their annual tax
returns. When a claim is first made for a tax exemption, the following
documention is required:</p>
<ul><li>A medical certificate detailing the person's incapacity</li>
  <li>A copy of the trust deed</li>
  <li>A declaration from the trustees declaring that the conditions regarding
    public subscriptions are met </li>
</ul></div>

<p>Setting up a trust fund has complex legal implications. It is important
therefore to seek the advice of a qualified legal professional (for example, a
<a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a>). In
addition, it is very important to discuss the tax implications with an
accountant and the Revenue Commissioners.</p>

<p>It is also possible to obtain tax relief for payments made to incapacited
individuals, through a <a shape="rect" href="../income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/deeds_of_covenant.html">deeds of
covenant</a>. Tax relief for payments made to incapacitated individuals can
also be obtained through the investment income from personal injuries awards.

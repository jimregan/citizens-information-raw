<p>If you have certain visual impairments you may claim a reduction in the
amount of tax that you pay.</p>

<p>Under the tax system, the amount of tax that you pay to the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie">Revenue Commissioners</a> may be reduced by a
system of tax credits and reliefs. You can read about <a shape="rect" href="../income_tax/how_your_tax_is_calculated.html">how your tax is
calculated</a> for an explanation of how they work.</p>

<p>If you have certain visual impairments you can claim the Blinds Person’s
Tax Credit. If you have a guide dog, you can apply for the Guide Dog Allowance.
In addition, refunds are available for Value Added Tax that is paid on certain
aids and appliances.</p>

<h2>Blind Person’s Tax Credit</h2>

<p>The Blind Person’s Tax Credit is €1,650 for 2017. For a married couple
or civil partners (where both spouses or civil partners are blind), the credit
is €3,300. </p>

<p>Parents cannot claim a Blind Person’s Tax Credit in respect of any
children who are blind, but you can claim the <a shape="rect" href="incapacitated_child_tax_credit.html">Incapacitated Child Tax Credit</a>.
</p>

<p>To apply for the Blind Person's Tax Credit, you must have a certificate from
an opthalmic surgeon (a physician who performs eye surgery). The certificate
must state:</p>
<ul><li>That your best vision does not exceed 6/60 visual acuity in the better
    eye with corrective lenses or </li>
  <li>That the widest diameter of your visual field subtends an angle no
    greater than 20 degrees. </li>
</ul><p>The certificate issued by your ophthalmic surgeon should state whether the
visual impairment is permanent, or temporary. If it is temporary, you will need
a certificate for each year for which the credit is claimed. Otherwise the tax
credit remains indefinitely.</p>

<h2>Guide Dog Allowance</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/credits/guide-dog.html">An
additional allowance is available if you, or your spouse, have a trained guide
dog</a>. (Guide dogs are especially trained to lead blind or visually impaired
people around obstacles). In 2017 the allowance is €825 and you claim it at
the standard rate of 20%.</p>

<p>To claim the allowance you must have a letter from Irish Guide Dogs for the
Blind confirming that you are a registered owner.</p>

<h2>Value Added Tax (VAT) Refunds</h2>

<p>Refunds can be claimed from Revenue for VAT paid on certain aids and
appliances designed to help a blind person cope with daily functions, for
example, specially adapted computer equipment, Braille books, Braille writing
equipment, etc. </p>

<p>A tax (or stamp duty) is charged by the Government on <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/stamp-duty/leaflets/stamp-duty-financial-cards.html">cards
issued by financial institutions in Ireland</a> each year. If you use one of
the following cards issued by a financial institution, you must pay a tax each
year. </p>

<p>These cards include: </p>
<ul><li>ATM (Automatic Teller Machine) cards and debit cards </li>
  <li>Credit cards and charge cards </li>
</ul><h3>Budget 2016</h3>

<p>The €2.50 per annum charge on ATM cards and €5 on combined (ATM and
debit) cards was abolished from 1 January 2016. A new 12 cent fee per ATM
withdrawal is being introduced from 1 January 2016. The total fee paid per
annum per card will be capped at €2.50 on ATM cards and €5 on combined (ATM
and debit) cards.</p>

<p>The transaction limit on contactless payments increased from €15 to €30
on 31 October 2015.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lf393e">ATM cards and debit cards</h2>

<p>From 1 January 2016, a new government stamp duty of 12 cent applies to ATM
withdrawals (this is in addition to any charge from your bank). This is capped
at €2.50 for ATM cards and €5 for combined (ATM and debit) cards. This
stamp duty will be collected in arrears. This means that charges you incur in
2016 will be charged to your account on 31 December 2016.<br></p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l98a57">Credit cards and charge cards</h2>

<p>A credit card is a plastic card issued by a financial institution that
allows you to obtain goods, services or cash up to a stipulated credit limit.
You then pay the credit card company for the amount of the total sales you
charge on the card. Interest is charged on any outstanding balance each
month.</p>

<p>A charge card can be used like a credit card except no interest is charged
since balances are paid by you at the end of each month. </p>

<p>The stamp duty is payable annually as follows: </p>
<ul><li>Credit cards: €30 </li>
  <li>Charge cards: €30 </li>
</ul><p>The charge is for each account. You can have additional cards issued on
his/her account without paying extra duty. Companies that have a number of
cards on one account must pay the duty on each card.</p>

<p>Stamp duty is generally collected on 1 April for the preceding year. The tax
year for the stamp duty begins on April 2. </p>

<p>If the credit card account is closed and has never been used, no stamp duty
is payable provided that you close the account in the same period as it was
opened. If you don't close the account in the period it was opened you will be
charged stamp duty on it even if it has never been used. If you have used your
card and you close your account during the year, you will be charged stamp duty
on closure. </p>

<p>If you are changing to a different credit card account you don’t have to
pay the duty again for that year. When you are closing the account your card
issuer will give you a letter of closure stating that you have paid your stamp
duty for the year. If you give this letter to your new card issuer, you will
not be charged stamp duty by them for that year. You can change account as
often as you like during the year without paying extra duty, as long as you
transfer a letter of closure between the card issuers each time. </p>

<p>You are not liable to stamp duty if your billing address is outside the
State for the entire accounting period in question.</p>

<p>In the case of a credit card account or a charge card account, where the
cardholder has died and the account is closed, there is no duty payable in
respect of the credit card account or charge card account on the following 1
April.</p>

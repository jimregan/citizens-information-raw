<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>Value Added Tax (VAT) is a tax charged on the sale of goods or services and
is included in the price of most products and services that we use every day.
</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p><strong>Who pays VAT?</strong></p>

<p>VAT is a tax on consumer spending so everyone who pays for good and services
pays VAT. It is built into the cost of many commonly consumed items such as
clothing and petrol, so you don’t see what percentage of VAT you are paying.
However, when you are buying items such as computers, electricity and
professional services, you will see the amount of VAT and the rate at which you
are being charged on your bill.</p>

<p><strong>How VAT is charged?<br></strong>VAT is charged at every stage of sale where the cost of an item is
increased. The standard rate of VAT is 23%.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>A manufacturer sells a television to a wholesaler for €100 and charges him
VAT on that amount at 23%. Therefore, the wholesaler pays €123 for the
television. The manufacturer then pays the VAT of €23 to the government.</p>

<p>The wholesaler goes on to sell the television to a retailer for €200. He
adds on VAT at 23%, so the retailer pays a total of €246. The wholesaler must
pay the government the VAT of €46, but he can reclaim the €23 VAT he has
already paid to the manufacturer, leaving €23, which he pays to the
government.</p>

<p>When the retailer comes to sell the television to a consumer, he must also
add on VAT to his selling price. He sells the television for €300, plus VAT
at 23%, making a selling price of €369 for the consumer. The retailer must
pay the VAT to the government but he can claim back the €46 VAT that he paid
to the wholesaler, leaving €23 for the government. </p>

<p>The government has now received 23% on the price paid for the television by
the consumer (€69). The retailer, wholesaler and manufacturer only paid the
amount of VAT they charged to the next group down the line.</p>

<h2>VAT on imports</h2>

<p>This section only deals with VAT for private individuals who buy goods for
personal use.</p>

<p>In general, you have to pay VAT and import duty on any goods you are
bringing into Ireland from outside the EU. This includes goods purchased online
and by mail order. You will have to pay VAT at the same rate as applies in
Ireland for similar goods. </p>

<p>Within the EU, VAT is usually paid in the member state you purchased the
goods, however, there are some exceptions - see below.</p>

<h3>If you buy online or by mail order etc.</h3>

<p><strong>From outside the EU</strong></p>

<p>You can buy goods from outside the EU up to a value of €22 without
incurring any VAT charges. Goods up to a value of €150 may be imported
without payment of customs duty. To avoid these packages being stopped by
Customs, the value should be clearly marked on the label. However, VAT and
import duty is charged on importations of tobacco, tobacco products, alcoholic
product and perfumes even if they cost less than €22. The Revenue
Commissioners provide a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/customs/leaflets/pn1179.html">guide to the
reliefs available for imports from non-EU countries</a>.</p>

<p>If your online purchase costs more than €22 you will have to pay VAT. If
your online purchase costs more than €150 you will have to pay VAT and
customs duty. This will be collected by the company that delivers your parcel.
The company usually have an administration charge. Methods of delivery and
collection differ from company to company, so you should contact them directly
for more information. </p>

<p><strong>From another EU Member State</strong></p>

<p>If you buy goods online or by mail from another EU member state you may pay
VAT at the rate that applies in Ireland. However, if the supplier that you are
buying the goods from has not exceeded the <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vat/guide/registration.html#section2">Distance
Sales Threshold</a> in Ireland then you will pay VAT at the rate appropriate to
that product in the member state of purchase. You will usually be informed of
the amount of VAT payable at checkout.</p>

<p>Excisable products (for example, alcohol, tobacco and oil) purchased within
the EU via the internet or by mail are subject to <a href="excise_duties.html">excise duty</a> and VAT. </p>

<h3>Traveling with your purchases</h3>

<p><strong>From outside the EU</strong></p>

<p>You can buy and bring your goods (other than tobacco and alcohol products)
from a non-EU State into Ireland without incurring any taxes, if the value of
your goods does not exceed:</p>
<ul><li>€430 in the case of an individual aged 15 years or over </li>
  <li>€215 in the case of an individual aged under 15 years. </li>
</ul><p>Anything in excess of the amounts shown above will be liable for VAT and
customs duty. </p>

<p>If you bring in an item worth more than the relevant limit of €430 or
€215, you must pay import charges on the full value. The Revenue
Commissioners have published <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/customs/leaflets/pn1878a.html">information for
travellers arriving in Ireland from countries outside the European
Union</a>.</p>

<p><strong>From another EU Member State</strong></p>

<p>There are no limits on what private people can buy and take with them when
they travel between EU countries, as long as the products purchased are for
personal use and not for resale, with exception of new means of transport (for
example, a car). VAT is included in the price of the product in the member
state and no further payment of taxes including VAT can be charged here in
Ireland. </p>

<p>However, special rules apply in the case of goods subject to excise duty,
such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. The Revenue Commissioners
have published <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/customs/leaflets/pn1878.html">information for
travellers arriving in Ireland from member states of the European Union</a>.</p>

<h3>Gifts from outside the EU</h3>

<p>You can receive a gift from outside the EU up to the value of €45 without
incurring import charges. However, the gift must be correctly declared. More
information is available in Revenue’s <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/customs/leaflets/pn1179.html">Guide to Relief
available for imports from non-EU countries</a>. </p>

<h2>VAT on residential property</h2>

<p>The following rules apply:</p>
<ul><li>If you are buying a new house from a builder or developer, you will be
    charged VAT at 13.5% </li>
  <li>If you are buying or selling an ‘old’ or existing property, you do
    not have to pay VAT </li>
  <li>If you are a landlord, you cannot charge VAT on rent from residential
    property </li>
  <li>If you buy a site for a house from a landowner, you do not have to pay
    VAT unless you have an agreement with both the landowner and a builder to
    develop the site <br></li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<p>If you paid VAT on your house (because you bought it from a developer or
builder) you only have to pay <a href="../../../housing/owning_a_home/buying_a_home/stamp_duty.html">stamp
duty</a> on the base price of the house – before the VAT was added. So, for
example, if you paid €227,000 (including VAT) for your new house, this is
made up of the base price of €200,000 plus 13.5% VAT (€27,000) and you only
pay stamp duty on the base price of €200,000. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>VAT is charged at different rates for various goods and services. You can
get an <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vat/rates/current-historic-rates-vat.html">extensive
list of VAT ratings</a> from the Revenue Commissioners. </p>

<p><strong>23%</strong> is the standard rate of VAT and all goods and services
that do not fall into the reduced rate categories are charged at this rate.
They include alcohol, audio-visual equipment, car parts and accessories, CDs,
computers, consultancy services, cosmetics, detergents, diesel, fridges,
furniture and furnishings, hardware, jewellery, lawnmowers, machinery,
medicines (non-oral), office equipment, pet food, petrol, paper, tobacco, toys,
tools, washing machines, bottled water.</p>

<p><strong>13.5%</strong> is a reduced rate of VAT for items including fuel
(coal, heating oil, gas), electricity, veterinary fees, building and building

<p><strong>Exempt from VAT</strong></p>

<p>You do not have to pay any VAT on financial, medical or educational
services. You may also not pay VAT for live theatrical and musical performances
(except those where food or drink is served during all or part of the
performance).</p>

<p><strong>Difference between exemption and zero-rating</strong></p>
</div>
If a business person supplies taxable goods or services, including zero-rated
ones, they can claim VAT back from the government on their taxable business
purchases. However, if someone only supplies exempt goods or services, they
cannot reclaim VAT.<div class="topic base_howtoapply">

<h3>Who can claim back VAT?</h3>

<p><strong>People not registered for VAT<br></strong>Under certain circumstances, unregistered people can claim back VAT
from the government. People with disabilities can claim a <a shape="rect" href="../tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/vat_refunds_on_aids_and_appliances_used_by_people_with_disabilities.html">VAT
refund on certain aids and appliances</a> they need to overcome their
disability. </p>

<p><strong>People registered for VAT<br></strong>A business person must register for VAT to fulfill tax obligations to
the government. Registering for VAT also allows a business to reclaim VAT on
purchases so that it never pays more tax than it should. As a result, VAT never
becomes an overhead for the business. </p>

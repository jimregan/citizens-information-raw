<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>An annual Local Property Tax (LPT) charged on all residential properties in
the State came into effect in 2013. The LPT is collected by the <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/index.html">Revenue Commissioners</a>. </p>

<p>If you own a residential property in the State you are liable for payment of
the tax. (This includes local authorities and social housing organisations.)
See ‘Who is liable to pay LPT’ below.</p>

<p><em>Residential property</em> is any building or structure (or part of a
building) which is used as, or is suitable for use as, a dwelling and includes
grounds of up to one acre. The LPT does not apply to development sites or
farmland.</p>

<p>The tax payable is based on the market value of relevant properties. The LPT
is a self-assessment tax so you calculate the tax due based on <strong>your own
assessment of the market value of the property</strong>. Revenue does not value
properties for LPT purposes but provides guidance on how to value your property
– see ‘Valuing your property’ below.</p>

<p>Revenue offers a range of methods for paying the tax. You can opt to make
one single payment or you can phase your payments in equal instalments. <a href="paying_local_property_tax.html">Read about how to pay your LPT.</a>
You can log in to the <a href="https://lpt.revenue.ie/lpt-web/views/login.html?execution=e1s1">LPT
On-line system</a> to view your Local Property Tax record and to pay any
arrears (using your PPSN, Property ID and PIN). You can also access LPT through
Revenue's <a href="https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html">myAccount</a>
and <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/ros/index.html">ROS services</a>.
</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Household and Non-Principal Private Residence Charges</h3>

<p>The Local Property Tax (LPT) replaced the <a href="../../../housing/owning_a_home/home_owners/household_charge.html">Household
Charge</a> which was abolished from 1 January 2013. Household Charge arrears
that were not paid by 1 July 2013 were converted into LPT and are now collected
by Revenue through the LPT system. The <a href="../../../housing/owning_a_home/home_owners/new_local_authority_charges_on_residential_property.html">Non-Principal
Private Residence (NPPR)</a> charge on second homes applied for 2013 and should
be paid to the relevant local authority. From 2014 onwards, the NPPR is no
longer charged, but outstanding liabilities and payments will still be
collected.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Who is liable to pay LPT?</h3>

<p>All owners of residential property, including rental properties, are liable
to pay the tax. The following groups are also liable for LPT:</p>
<ul><li>People who have a long-term lease (20 years or more)</li>
  <li>People with a life interest or long-term right of residence (life or more
    than 20 years) in a residential property</li>
  <li>Local authorities or social housing organisations</li>
  <li>A person acting as a personal representative for a deceased owner (for
    example, as an executor/administrator of an estate). Trustees or
    beneficiaries are jointly liable where a residential property is held in
    trust.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Joint owners:</strong> If there is more than one owner they need to
agree who will make the LPT return and pay the tax. If no one pays the tax
Revenue can collect the Revenue Estimate of the LPT liability from any of the
owners.</p>

<p><strong>Rental properties:</strong> Where the residential property is rented
on a normal short-term lease (less than 20 years), the landlord will be liable
for LPT. Long-term leases (more than 20 years), life tenancies and situations
where a person occupies a residential property on a rent-free basis over an
extended period and without challenge to their right of occupation will be
treated as if the occupant owns the property. In these circumstances, the
occupant will be liable for LPT. </p>

<h4>Liability date</h4>

<p>You are a <em>liable person</em> for the Local Property Tax if you own a
residential property on the <em>liability </em>(or <em>ownership) date</em>.
The liability date was 1 May 2013 for the year 2013. From 2014 on, the
liability date is always 1 November in the preceding year. </p>

<p><strong>For 2017 the liability date is 1 November 2016</strong>. </p>

<h3>Unoccupied and uninhabitable properties</h3>

<p>If a residential property is suitable for use as a dwelling but is
unoccupied, it is liable for LPT. However, if the property is not suitable for
use as a dwelling, it is not liable for LPT and you do not need to make an LPT
return. If you think that your property is not suitable for use as a dwelling
and it is not being lived in, you must notify Revenue as soon as possible after
receiving your LPT return. You must also include relevant supporting
documentation, for example, an engineer’s report. Revenue will consider your
claim and make a decision using the documentation you provide.</p>

<h3>Exempt properties</h3>

<p>If a property is a residential property on the liability date in any year
(since 2013) it is a relevant residential property and is chargeable to LPT.
Certain properties are exempt from LPT. You can find out more in our document
on <a href="local_property_tax_exemptions.html">Exemptions from Local
Property Tax</a>. </p>

<p>Note that, even if you own an exempt property, you must still make a return
to claim an exemption. </p>

<h3>Valuing your property</h3>

<p>The tax is based on the <em>chargeable value</em> of a residential property
on the <em>valuation date</em>. The chargeable value is defined as the market
value that the property could reasonably be expected to fetch in sale on the
open market on the valuation date. <strong>The valuation date is 1 May 2013.
This valuation applies until 1 November 2019</strong>. This means that the
valuation of your property for LPT purposes on 1 May 2013 will stay the same
until 2019 (even if you make improvements to your property). </p>

<p>A property adapted to make it suitable for occupation by a person with a
disability (where the adaptation work resulted in an increase in the value of
the property) can qualify for a reduction in the market value of the property
for LPT purposes. There was a requirement for this work to have been
grant-aided by a local authority but this no longer applies. You can read <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/property/documents/lpt/guidelines-reliefs-disabled-incapacitated.pdf">Revenue's
Guidelines on Local Property Tax Relief for Disabled/Incapacitated Individuals
(pdf)</a>. </p>

<p>Valuation was by self-assessment in 2013. Revenue developed an <a href="https://lpt.revenue.ie/lpt-web/valuation-guide/index.htm">online guide
providing indicative property values</a>. This guide helps you to value your
property by providing average indicative values for different property types in
your local area. You can check the register of residential property sales,
published by the Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA), <a href="http://www.propertypriceregister.ie/">propertypriceregister.ie</a>, when
considering the value of your property.</p>

<p>If you follow Revenue’s guidance honestly, Revenue will accept your
self-assessed property valuation. Revenue’s valuation guidance is intended to
help property owners but each property owner must consider the specifics of
their own property when working out its value. Revenue may query your valuation
if it has reason to believe your property has been under-valued. </p>

<p>You do not have to include documentation when submitting your LPT Return.
However you should keep copies of the information sources when valuing your
property in case Revenue queries your valuation. These might include the
property section of your local newspaper, information on the sales price of a
similar house sold in the area, information downloaded from property websites
or details taken from Revenue’s valuation guidance.</p>

<p>The Revenue Commissioners can legally enter a residential property for the
purpose of ascertaining its chargeable value. You must permit a person
authorised by the Revenue Commissioners to inspect the property if they
consider this necessary.</p>

<p><strong>If you did not submit a Local Property Tax return with your
self-assessment of the LPT payable, the Revenue Estimate becomes due and
payable.</strong> The Revenue Estimate is automatically displaced when you
submit a return with your self-assessment of the amount of LPT due.</p>

<h3>Selling your property</h3>

<p>You are liable for LPT if you own a property on the <em>liability date</em>.
The liability date for 2013 was 1 May 2013. The liability date for 2014 was 1
November 2013. The liability date for 2015 was 1 November 2014. The liability
date for 2016 was 1 November 2015. The liability date for 2017 is <strong>1
November 2016</strong>. The actual charge payable on the property is based on
its value on the <em>valuation date</em> (1 May 2013). The next valuation date
is 1 November 2019.</p>

<p>For example, if you own a property on 1 November 2016 and subsequently sell
it any time before 1 November 2017 you are liable to pay LPT for 2017. This
payment should be made before the sale of the property closes. </p>

<p>In most cases a residential property that was exempt on 1 May 2013 continues
to be exempt until the next valuation date even where the property is sold or
ownership is transferred by way of gift or an inheritance. In these cases the
exemption automatically carries over to the new owner of the property. There is
one exception to this. Second-hand properties purchased between 1 January 2013
and 31 December 2013 are exempt until the end of 2019 if used as your sole or
main residence. However, where the property is subsequently sold or otherwise
transferred to a new owner after 2013 this exemption no longer applies. </p>

<p>The Local Property Tax (LPT) is based on market value bands. The first band
covers all properties worth up to €100,000. Bands then go up in multiples of
€50,000. If a property is valued at €1 million or lower, the tax is based
on the mid-point of the relevant band. For properties valued over €1 million
the tax is charged on the balance over €1 million, with no banding applied.
The basic LPT rate was set at 0.18% for properties valued under €1 million
and 0.25% on the amount of the value over €1 million. From 2015 these basic
rates can be increased or decreased by up to 15% (see ‘The local adjustment
factor’ below). </p>

can view a table of all LPT rates including the local adjustment factor on
revenue.ie. </a></p>

<p>Revenue has developed an <a href="https://lpt.revenue.ie/lpt-web/reckoner/lpt.html?locale=en">on-line
calculator</a> that you can use to work out how much Local Property Tax is
payable on your property based on your self-assessed valuation.</p>

<h3>The local adjustment factor</h3>

<p>From 2015 onwards, local authorities can vary the basic LPT rate on
residential properties in their administrative area. The basic rates of LPT are
0.18% and 0.25%. These rates can be increased or decreased by up to 15% (both
rates must be adjusted by the same amount). This is referred to as the local
adjustment factor.</p>

<p>The introduction of the local adjustment factor means that residential
properties of the same value in different local authority areas may pay
different amounts of LPT from 2015 on, depending on whether the local authority
has applied a local adjustment factor or not.</p>

<p>If a local authority passes a resolution to vary the basic LPT rates of
0.18% and 0.25% for 2017, Revenue must have been notified of the local
adjustment factor on or before 30 September 2016. The local authority must also
publish a notice of the variation of LPT on its website and in at least one
local newspaper. Revenue then adjusts the LPT liability for residential
properties within the local authority’s administrative area.</p>

<p>For example, if your house is valued under €100,000, you will have paid
€90 LPT in 2016 at the standard rate. If the LPT rate in your local authority
area is decreased by 15%, you pay €76 LPT in 2017. You do not need to do
anything. Your LPT record was updated in October 2016 to include your 2017 LPT
charge and you can confirm your LPT rate for 2017 by accessing your online LPT
record using your PPS number, Property ID and PIN. Revenue’s <a href="https://lpt.revenue.ie/lpt-web/reckoner/lpt.html">online calculator</a>
has been adjusted to include the local adjustment factor where it applies.</p>

<h3>Voluntary deferrals</h3>

<p>There is a system of deferral arrangements for some owners. You can read
more about deferrals in our document, <a href="deferring_local_property_tax.html">Deferring payment of the Local
Property Tax</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Making a return</h3>

<p>During March 2013, Revenue sent notices to all liable persons. This notice
advised you of your property tax obligations and explained how to complete your
property tax return. </p>

<p>If you owned or had a long-term lease on a property on 1 May 2013, you were
a liable person and should have submitted your return to Revenue on or before 7
May 2013 (see section ‘Who is liable to pay LPT’ above for further
details). If you submitted your return online through the Revenue website you
had until 28 May 2013. </p>

<p>If you own more than one residential property or you are obliged to make
your tax returns online you <strong>must</strong> make your return online.
(Note that if you have problems making an online return you can get help in
your local Revenue office, where computers are available and a Revenue official
will help you. Alternatively, you may authorise another person to file your LPT
return for you. You can also call 1890 200 255 to pay and file online over the
telephone. You will need your property details and details of your bank account
or other source from which you want the payment deducted.)</p>

<p>People who own exempt properties must make a return to claim an exemption.
Note that if you bought a new property in 2013 or if you bought a property as
your main residence in 2013 an exemption from LPT applies until 2019. However,
you must still make a return. </p>

<p>In your return, you include your assessment of the valuation of your
property by selecting the relevant market value band and choose a payment
method. You can also claim a deferral of payment if you are eligible to do so
– see ‘Voluntary deferrals’ above.</p>

<p>You can see a <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/property/documents/lpt/lpt1-return.pdf">sample
LPT Return form (pdf)</a>. </p>

<p><strong>After submitting your return in 2013 you do not have to submit
another one until 1 November 2019</strong>. You pay the LPT every year based on
the valuation on 1 May 2013.</p>

<h3>Paying the LPT</h3>

<p>Revenue offer a range of methods for paying the tax. You can opt to make one
single payment or you can phase your payments in equal instalments. You can
read about how to pay the LPT in our document '<a href="paying_local_property_tax.html">Paying the Local Property Tax</a>'.
</p>

<h3>Key LPT dates</h3>

<p>If you opt for payment by instalment, such as direct debit or deduction at
source, payment will be spread evenly over the rest of the year.</p>

    </tr></tbody></table><h3>Amending your return</h3>

<p>In most cases if you wish to amend your submitted return, you can do so
online. However you must apply in writing if you wish to amend your valuation
downwards. Any amendment must be supported by evidence to explain or prove the
need to decrease the value. Appropriate evidence can be in the form of recent
sales or advertised house prices in the area, professional valuations or house
price surveys for the area. You can find out more in Revenue's <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/valuing-your-property/what-if-the-value-declared-for-your-property-was-incorrect.aspx">Self-Correction
Guidelines</a>. </p>

<h3>What happens if you don’t pay?</h3>

<p>Each return sent out by Revenue includes a notice of the Revenue Estimate of
the tax due. If you are a liable person and you do not submit a return, the
Revenue Estimate will become payable by default and Revenue will collect the
amount due. Revenue can use a range of collection options including:</p>
<ul><li>Mandatory deduction from your salary, wages or occupational pension</li>
  <li>Attachment of your bank account (this means taking money without your
    consent using an attachment order)</li>
  <li>Referral of the debt to a sheriff or a solicitor for collection</li>
  <li>The withholding of refunds of other tax as payment against LPT due</li>
</ul><p>The Revenue Estimate will automatically be displaced when you submit a
return with your self-assessment of the amount of LPT due.</p>

<p><strong>Self-employed people:</strong> If you are self-employed and do not
make your LPT Return with a self-assessment of your LPT liability, the amount
set out in the Revenue Estimate will be collected using normal collection and
enforcement options (for example, sheriff, court action or attachment orders).
If you fail to pay your LPT, Revenue will not issue you with a <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/starting-a-business/tax-clearance/index.aspx">tax
clearance certificate</a>. In addition, a self-employed person who fails to
submit his or her LPT return on time may incur an LPT-generated surcharge when
filing their income tax return, regardless of whether the income tax return is
submitted on time.</p>

<p>If Revenue does not collect the amount of LPT due, for whatever reason, then
a charge will be put on your property. You will not be able to sell it without
paying the tax together with interest and, where appropriate, penalties.</p>

<p>You can get more information on <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/what-happens-if-you-dont-comply/index.aspx">Failure
to meet LPT obligations</a> from Revenue. </p>

<h3>Complaints</h3>

<p>You can contact the <a href="http://www.ombudsman.gov.ie/en/">Office of the
Ombudsman</a> if you are unhappy about the way in which Revenue has handled any
aspect of your tax affairs. The Ombudsman's staff examine complaints about the
administrative actions of government departments and offices, including
Revenue.</p>

<h3>Appeals</h3>

<p>In general, because LPT is a self-assessed tax, formal appeals only arise in
a small number of situations.</p>

<p>If you do not agree with a Revenue Estimate you can displace it by
submitting a return with your own self-assessment.</p>

<p>Since Revenue has compiled a register of residential properties from various
sources there may be errors about ownership of some properties. If you got a
LPT Return form and you do not consider yourself a liable person for that
property you should notify Revenue in writing within 30 days of receiving the
letter. You should include an explanation of why you do not consider yourself a
liable person, the details of the person you think is the liable person (name,
address and PPS Number) and supporting documentation. It is very important that
you contact Revenue since if the error is not corrected you are liable to pay
the tax. Revenue will use the information you supply to make a determination on
whether you are a liable person. If you do not agree you can appeal this
determination to <a href="http://www.taxappeals.ie/">the Appeal
Commissioners</a>.</p>

<p>If you disagree with Revenue on other matters (for example, whether the
property is residential, the valuation or whether you can defer payment) and
the matter cannot be resolved, Revenue will issue a formal Notice of Assessment
or a formal decision on the matter to you. Your right to appeal to the Appeal
Commissioners will be set out clearly on the notices. However you must make a
return and pay any tax due before you can appeal the Notice of assessment or
any other Revenue decision.</p>

<h4>Background to the tax</h4>

<p>In January 2012, the Government established an <a href="http://www.housing.gov.ie/housing/chargestaxes/local-property-tax/inter-departmental-group-property-tax">Inter-Departmental
Group on Property Tax</a>. This Group considered the design of a property tax
to replace the Household Charge. You can read the Report of the
Inter-Departmental Group <a href="http://www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/migrated-files/en/Publications/LocalGovernment/Administration/FileDownLoad,31669,en.Pdf">‘Design

<h3>Summary of LPT valuation procedure</h3>

<p>During March 2013 Revenue wrote to residential property owners – see
‘Who is liable to pay LPT’ below. This letter included an LPT Return form
for completion, an explanatory booklet and a Revenue Estimate of LPT liability.
The Revenue Estimate of LPT liability is not a valuation of a property nor
should it be regarded as an accurate calculation of LPT liability. It is simply
the amount that Revenue will collect from property owners if they do not submit
their LPT return.</p>

<p>The explanatory booklet helped you to assess the value of your property –
see ‘Valuing your property’ below - work out how much you will have to pay,
complete the LPT Return form and decide how pay your LPT. You can read <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/lpt/local-property-tax-guide.pdf">more on
the Revenue website</a> and see a <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/property/documents/lpt/lpt1-return.pdf">sample
LPT Return form (pdf)</a>. </p>

<p>You should have sent your completed LPT Return form back to Revenue by
<strong>7 May 2013</strong> if submitting a paper form or by <strong>28 May
2013</strong> if submitting your return online through <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/index.html">revenue.ie</a>. A half-year payment
was due in 2013, with a full-year payment due in 2014 and subsequent years. </p>

<p>The valuation of your property for LPT purposes on 1 May 2013 <strong>stays
the same</strong> for 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 (even if you make
improvements to your property). The next valuation date is 1 November 2019. </p>

<p>You may opt to defer, or partially defer payment of your Local Property Tax
(LPT) if you meet the conditions.</p>

<p>You may qualify for a deferral under one of 4 separate categories:</p>
<ul><li>Income threshold</li>
  <li>Personal representatives of a deceased liable person</li>
  <li>Personal insolvency</li>
  <li>Hardship grounds</li>
</ul><p>If you meet the deferral criteria you can opt to defer the full LPT until
your financial circumstances improve or the property is sold. However this does
not mean that you are exempt from the LPT. Interest is charged on the deferred
amount and the deferred amount remains a charge on the property.</p>

<p>There are partial deferral arrangements. If you meet the partial deferral
criteria you can opt to defer 50% of your LPT liability and pay the balance.
Interest of 4% per annum is charged on the deferred amount and it remains a
charge on the property. If you qualify for a partial deferral of LPT you must
<a href="paying_local_property_tax.html">contact Revenue and select a
payment method</a> for the remaining 50% of your LPT liability.</p>

<p>You can get further information on <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/deferral-of-payment/index.aspx">Revenue's
website on deferring payment of LPT</a>.</p>

<h3>Deferral of LPT based on income threshold</h3>

<p>To qualify for full or partial deferral for LPT based on the income
threshold criteria you must be an owner occupier and your gross annual income
from all sources must not exceed certain amounts (see table below). You qualify
for deferral each year based on your estimated gross income for the previous
year. So, for example, if you are liable for LPT on 1 November 2016 (the
liability date) you should assess your estimated gross income for 2016 to see
whether you qualify for deferral or partial deferral in 2017. If your gross
income for 2016 is below the threshold you will qualify for deferral of the tax
in 2017.</p>

<p>To qualify for full or partial deferral your gross annual income from all
sources must not exceed certain amounts (see table below). If you have an
outstanding mortgage the income threshold is increased by 80% of your gross
mortgage interest payments. You must be paying the mortgage to qualify.</p>

<p></p>

<table border="1"><caption><strong>Income thresholds for full and partial (50%) deferral of LPT
  liability</strong></caption>
  <col><col><col><tbody><tr><td><strong>Liable person (owner-occupiers only)</strong></td>
      <td><strong>To qualify for a full deferral your gross income must not
        exceed</strong></td>

        must not exceed</strong></td>
    </tr><tr><td>Single, no mortgage</td>

      <td>€25,000</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Couple, no mortgage</td>

      <td>€25,000 + 80% of gross mortgage interest</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Couple, with mortgage</td>
      <td>€25,000 + 80% of gross mortgage interest</td>
      <td>€35,000 + 80% of gross mortgage interest</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<p><em>Gross income</em> is your income before any deductions, allowances or
reliefs. It includes income that is exempt from income tax and income from
Department of Social Protection payments but does not include Child Benefit.</p>

<p><em>Couples</em> include married people, people in a civil partnership and
certain cohabitants. For LPT deferral purposes cohabitants must have lived
together for at least 2 years if you have children and 5 years if you do not
have children.</p>

<p>A single person or a couple whose only income is a payment from the
Department of Social Protection (DSP) will qualify for a full deferral because
DSP payment rates are below the thresholds.</p>

<p>Deferrals based on income thresholds are granted on a self-assessment basis
and there is no approval process. Revenue takes your word that your gross
income is likely to be below the relevant threshold and the deferral is granted
automatically when Revenue gets your LPT1 form.</p>

<p>If you claimed a deferral for a year and your circumstances change you must
inform Revenue. </p>

<h4>What happens if the liable person dies? </h4>

<p>If one member of a couple who qualified for a deferral dies the deferral
will remain in place until the next valuation date (currently 1 November 2019)
and the income of the surviving person is not taken into account until then.
</p>

<p>On 1 November 2019, the surviving person may make a claim for deferral of
the tax. If you satisfy the conditions, you will qualify for deferral. If you
do not qualify for deferral the amount that was deferred up to the end of 2019
may continue to be deferred. Interest at 4% per annum will be continue to be
charged on the deferred amount in the usual way. </p>

<p>If you inherit a property from another person (for example, a parent) the
deferral will remain in place until the next liability date (1 November each
year). After that date, Revenue may allow the deferral to continue if you apply
for a deferral and satisfy the conditions for deferral in your own right. The
transfer of the property to you means that the tax deferred to that point plus
interest becomes payable at the date of transfer unless you satisfy the
conditions for a deferral in your own right.</p>

<h3>Deferral for personal representatives of a deceased liable person</h3>

<p><a href="../../../death/the_deceaseds_estate/what_happens_the_deceaseds_estate.html">When
a person dies, his/her property passes to his/her personal representative.</a>
The personal representative then has the duty to distribute the deceased
person's money and property in accordance with the law, the will - if there is
one - or the laws of intestacy if there is no will. The personal
representatives of a deceased liable person may apply for a deferral until (a)
the property is transferred or sold or (b) 3 years after the date of death
(whichever is earlier). To qualify for deferral the deceased person must have
been the sole owner of the property.</p>

<p>You can claim a deferral for any LPT outstanding at the date of death, any
LPT already deferred by the deceased person and LPT that became payable
following the death.</p>

<h3>Deferral based on personal insolvency</h3>

<p>If you have entered into a <a href="../../personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_options.html">Debt
Settlement Arrangement or a Personal Insolvency Arrangement</a> you can apply
for a deferral of LPT while the insolvency arrangement is in place. You must
have formally agreed your insolvency arrangement with the Insolvency Service of
Ireland and your Insolvency Case Number must be included with your
application.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Deferral based on hardship</h3>

<p>If you do not qualify for a deferral under the other categories and you have
had both an unexpected and unavoidable significant financial loss or expense,
as a result of which you cannot pay the LPT without causing excessive financial
hardship, you can apply for full or partial deferral.</p>

<p>You must disclose your financial circumstances and any other information
required by Revenue.</p>

<p>Examples of the type of losses or expenses that may be considered when
granting a deferral on these grounds include:</p>
<ul><li>Emergency medical expenses</li>
  <li>Major repairs to a house that are needed to keep the house habitable and
    that arise unexpectedly</li>
  <li>Expenses connected with a serious accident or death of a family
  member</li>
  <li>Losing your job</li>
  <li>A bad debt incurred by a self-employed person</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Any deferred amounts have interest charged on them at a rate of 0.011% per
day (4% a year).</p>

<p><strong>Example of interest calculation:</strong> Jack sells his home 3.5
years after he first deferred his LPT payment in July 2013. He deferred €100
of LPT in 2013 and €200 for each of the years 2014, 2015 and 2016. On the day
Jack sells his house he is liable for 3.5 years of LPT. He therefore owes
€700 of tax in total. However he owes varying amounts of interest on that tax
since the first year’s deferral will have incurred 3.5 years’ interest –
but the next year’s tax will have incurred 3 years’ interest and so on. So
the interest would be calculated like this (note that this figures are just for
demonstration purposes and do not represent an actual LPT charge):</p>

<table border="1" style="width: 100%"><col><col><tbody><tr><td>Year 1- Year 4: 2013 - 2016</td>
      <td>€100 x 3.5 years (1,276 days) at 0.011% interest per day = €14.04
        interest</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Year 2– Year 4: 2014 - 2016</td>
      <td>€200 x 3 years (1,095 days) at 0.011% interest each day = €24.09
        interest</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Year 3 – Year 4: 2015 - 2016</td>
      <td>€200 x 2 years (730 days) at 0.011% interest each day = €16.06
        interest</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Year 4: 2016</td>
      <td>€200 x 1 year (365 days) = €8.03 interest</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="2">The total amount of interest Jack has to pay on €700 of
        deferred LPT is €62.22. So Jack will pay <strong>€762.22</strong>
        in total.</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>To apply for a deferral or partial deferral on the basis of the
<strong>income threshold criteria</strong> you use the LPT1 form only. This is
available when you access your <a href="https://lpt.revenue.ie/lpt-web/views/login.html?execution=e1s1">LPT
record on-line</a>. If you don't file on-line, an LPT1 form will issue to you
automatically by Revenue. If you are applying for a deferral under any of the
other 3 categories you must fill in the LPT1 form and an <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/property/documents/lpt/form-lpt2.pdf">LPT2 form
(pdf)</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can access your LPT record on-line using your Property ID, Property PIN
and PPSN or tax reference number to claim a deferral for 2017. You must apply
by 11 January 2017. Alternatively, if you received a letter and an LPT1form
from Revenue, you may complete the LPT1 form and submit this to the Revenue
Commissioners by 11 January 2017.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you have been allowed a deferral you can make a payment at any time of
all or some of the deferred amount. Revenue will credit a partial payment to
the oldest period of deferred LPT first.</p>

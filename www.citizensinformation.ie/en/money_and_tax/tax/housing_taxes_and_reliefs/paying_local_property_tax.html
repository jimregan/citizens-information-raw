<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Revenue offer a range of methods for paying your <a href="local_property_tax.html">Local Property Tax (LPT)</a>. You can opt to
make one single payment or you can pay the tax in equal instalments over the
year. See ‘Payment methods’ below.</p>

<p>Your LPT is based on the <strong>valuation of your property on 1 May
2013</strong>. The rate you pay may vary in 2017 because of the local
adjustment factor. This means that the basic LPT rates can be adjusted up or
down by up to 15% in different local authority areas. In 2016, <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/valuing-your-property/has-your-local-authority-rate-changed.aspx">a
number of local authorities have adjusted LPT rates in their area for 2017</a>.
These adjustments will be applied automatically by Revenue. </p>

<p>You can check how much LPT you owe for 2017 by <a href="https://lpt.revenue.ie/lpt-web/views/login.html">accessing your LPT
record online</a> using your PPS number, Property ID and PIN. You can also use
<a href="https://lpt.revenue.ie/lpt-web/reckoner/lpt.html?locale=en">Revenue's
online calculator</a> to check how much LPT is payable in different local
authority areas.</p>

<h3>Revenue myAccount</h3>

<p>You can also access Local Property Tax online through Revenue's <a href="https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html">myAccount</a> and through <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/ros/index.html">ROS</a>. MyAccount
consolidates access to all of Revenue’s secure online services (except ROS)
using a single log-in and password. It is open to everyone who is not
registered for ROS. The existing <a href="https://lpt.revenue.ie/lpt-web/views/login.html?execution=e1s1">LPT
portal</a> will continue to remain open.</p>

<p></p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lcd68a">Paying the LPT in 2017</h2>

<p>If you were the liable person for the property on 1 November 2016 (generally
the person who owns the property) you have to pay LPT for 2017. You do not need
to revalue your property for 2017 since the valuation that applied on 1 May
2013 continues to be valid. If you sell your property after 1 November 2016 you
are liable for the 2017 LPT on the property. </p>

<p>If you claimed <a href="deferring_local_property_tax.html">a full
deferral of your LPT liability</a> and your circumstances have not changed you
do not need to do anything. If you think you may qualify for a full or partial
deferral of LPT in 2017 you can claim a deferral through the <a href="https://lpt.revenue.ie/lpt-web/views/login.html?execution=e1s1">LPT
online system</a>. If you are eligible for a partial deferral you still need to
tell Revenue what payment method you want to use to pay the remainder of your
LPT liability (see 'Payment methods' below). </p>

<p></p>

<h3>People who paid 2016 LPT in instalments</h3>

<p>If you paid your 2016 LPT <strong>in instalments</strong> or in phased
payments (for example, by deduction at source or direct debit) this payment
method automatically applies for 2017 and subsequent years. Revenue did not
contact you unless your local authority adjusted the rate for 2017. If your LPT
rate changed for 2017 you did not need to do anything. Revenue automatically
adjusted your payment. You do not need to contact Revenue unless you wish to
select a different payment method for 2017. See 'Changing your payment method'
below. </p>

<h3>People who paid 2016 LPT in a lump sum or cash</h3>

<p>If you paid your LPT in 2016 in one lump sum (for example, by single debit
authority, debit or credit card, cheque, postal order or cash) or made regular
payments in cash you needed to confirm your payment method for 2017.</p>

<p>You should have got a letter from Revenue (or an email if you are a ROS
customer) confirming the amount of LPT due for 2017 and telling you whether
your local authority changed the rate for 2017. If you own more than one
property the letter will confirm the total amount due for all your properties.
The letter included your Property ID and PIN.</p>

<p>When you got this letter you should have confirmed how you want to pay your
2017 LPT to Revenue - by 25 November 2016 if you wanted to use a phased payment
method or by 11 January 2017 if you wanted to pay in full in one lump sum. You
could choose to continue to pay your LPT in the way you paid it in 2016 or you
can change your payment method. </p>

<h4>Changing your payment method</h4>

<p>You can change (or confirm) your payment method using the <a href="https://lpt.revenue.ie/lpt-web/views/login.html?execution=e1s1">LPT
online system</a>. If you need help with changing your payment method online
you can call the LPT helpline on 1890 200 255.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l0da8d">Payment methods</h2>

<p>You could choose any of these payment methods for 2017 even if you
previously paid in a different way. You could pay your LPT for 2017 <strong>in
full</strong> by:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/paying-your-lpt/can-you-pay-your-lpt-by-credit-or-debit-card.aspx">Debit/credit
    card</a>: This option is available online. Note that if you pay by
    debit/credit card the deduction will be made immediately.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/paying-your-lpt/can-you-pay-your-lpt-by-annual-debit-instruction.aspx">Bank
    single debit authority</a>: Under a single debit authority you can
    authorise your bank or financial institution to pay Revenue the specified
    amount of LPT due. This amount is taken from your bank account in one
    deduction on 21 March 2017 and is paid directly to Revenue.</li>
  <li>Cash or debit/credit card payments through <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/paying-your-lpt/can-you-pay-your-lpt-by-approved-payment-service-provider.aspx">certain
    payment service providers (you can check the list on revenue.ie)</a>. A
    transaction charge usually applies. </li>
  <li>Cheque or postal order: People who pay online cannot pay by cheque or
    postal order. On page 1 of the LPT1A Payment Instruction form (“Option 2
    – Payment in Full”) insert an x in the relevant box to confirm that you
    are paying by cheque or postal order. Make your cheque or postal order
    payable to the Collector-General and record your Property ID on the back of
    it. Do not 'post-date' your cheque or postal order. Send the cheque or
    postal order and your LPT1A Payment Instruction form to Revenue LPT Branch,
    PO Box 1, Limerick by 11 January 2017. Cheques and postal orders will be
    processed as soon as Revenue receives them. <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/paying-your-lpt/can-you-pay-your-lpt-by-cheque.aspx">Find
    out more about paying by cheque or postal order</a>.</li>
</ul><p>You could <strong></strong>pay your LPT for 2017 <strong>in
instalments</strong> (phased payments) by:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/paying-your-lpt/can-you-pay-your-lpt-by-direct-debit.aspx">Direct
    debit</a> - you can pay monthly by direct debit</li>
  <li>Deduction at source from <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/lpt/deduction-at-source.html">salary or
    occupational pension.</a> You need your employer or pension provider’s
    name and tax registration number. This number is on your P60 and may be on
    your payslip.</li>
  <li>Deduction at source from <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/paying-your-lpt/can-you-pay-lpt-from-department-of-social-protection-or-other-departments-payments.aspx">certain
    social welfare payments</a>*</li>
  <li>Deduction at source from <a href="http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/">certain
    scheme payments made to farmers by the Department of Agriculture, Food and
    the Marine (DAFM)</a></li>
  <li>Cash or debit/credit card payments through <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/paying-your-lpt/can-you-pay-your-lpt-by-approved-payment-service-provider.aspx">certain
    payment service providers (you can check the list on revenue.ie)</a>. A
    transaction charge usually applies. 
    <p>*The payments are State Pension (Contributory, Non-Contributory or
    Transition), Widow/Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory or
    Non-Contributory Pension, One-Parent Family Payment, Invalidity Pension,
    Carer's Allowance, Disability Allowance and Blind Pension. You should note
    that the Department of Social Protection will not make deductions that will
    bring a payment below the personal rate of basic Supplementary Welfare
    Allowance. </p>
  </li>
</ul><p>Note that if you chose to pay in instalments from your salary, pension,
social welfare or scheme payments your LPT payments are deducted in equal
instalments. This means that the amount of each instalment will depend on how
frequently you are paid. For example, people getting monthly salary payments
will have their LPT payment deducted monthly. Social welfare pensions are paid
weekly so a weekly LPT deduction will be made.</p>

<h2>Paying LPT arrears</h2>

<p>If you have not filed a LPT Return or paid your LPT for 2013 and/or 2014
and/or 2015 and/or 2016 and/or 2017 you should pay and file as soon as
possible. If you do not pay the outstanding amounts Revenue will contact you
and will inform you of the way in which they propose to recover the debt.</p>

<p>Revenue will also recover arrears of the <a href="../../../housing/owning_a_home/home_owners/household_charge.html">Household
Charge</a> (which is now collected through the LPT system). </p>

<p>Collection methods include: </p>
<ul><li>Mandatory deduction from your salary, wages or occupational pension</li>
  <li>Attachment of your bank account (this means taking money without your
    consent using an attachment order)</li>
  <li>Referral of the debt to a sheriff or a solicitor for collection</li>
  <li>The withholding of refunds of other tax as payment against LPT due</li>
</ul><p>If you are self-employed and fail to pay your LPT or Household Charge
arrears, Revenue will not issue you with a <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/starting-a-business/tax-clearance/index.aspx">tax
clearance certificate</a>. </p>

<p>Read further information from Revenue on <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/services/property/make-a-payment-for-household-charge-arrears.aspx">Household

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>A deed of covenant is a legally binding agreement that is written down and
agreed between 2 people stating that one person agrees to pay the other an
agreed amount of money without receiving any benefit in return. </p>

<p>You can agree to pay any amount of money under the deed but it is important
to remember that the deed must be properly drawn up, signed, witnessed, sealed
and delivered to the individual receiving the payments.</p>

<p><span>Tax relief on covenants is only available where the covenants are
being made to particular groups.</span> These groups consist of permanently
incapacitated minors, permanently incapacitated adults, and people over 65
years of age. (A minor is a child under 18 years of age who is not married).
Parents of incapacitated minor children cannot claim tax relief on covenants in
favour of their own permanently incapacitated minor child. However, tax relief
can be claimed on covenants made in favour of permanently incapacitated minor
children by people other than their parents. The exact tax saving depends on
the amount of tax paid by the person making the payment (the covenantor) and on
the amount of the income of the person receiving the payment (the covenantee).
</p>

<p>In order for the deed of covenant to be tax effective, the deed must be
capable of lasting more than 6 years. It is recommended by Revenue therefore
that the period of the covenant be for 7 years. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Unrestricted tax relief can be claimed on covenants in favour of permanently
incapacitated minors other than from parents to their own minor incapacitated
children. Unrestricted tax relief can be claimed on covenants in favour of
permanently incapacitated adults. </p>

<p>Tax relief can be claimed on covenants in favour of adults aged over 65
years. The amount of tax relief available on one or more covenants cannot
exceed 5% of the covenantor's total income (gross income less certain
deductions such as expenses, capital allowances, etc). </p>

<h3>Making a deed of covenant</h3>

<p>The deed must be properly drawn up, signed, witnessed, sealed and delivered
to the individual. You can get a <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/forms/deed-of-covenant.pdf">deed of
covenant form (pdf)</a> from Revenue. </p>

<p>The person receiving the payment (the covenantee) must have a <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">PPS
number</a>. If they do not have a PPS number, they should get in touch with
their local Department of Social Protection office and either trace their
existing PPS number or obtain a new one. </p>

<p>Payments made under the deed must be without any benefit being received from
the covenantee in return (either directly, or indirectly). In other words, the
person paying the money cannot receive anything beneficial from the person
receiving the money either directly from them or indirectly through someone
else. </p>

<p>A deed can only be effective from a current date (in other words, you cannot
backdate a deed). </p>

<p>A deed to an individual must be capable of lasting more than 6 years. </p>

<p>You must enter into the deed before you make any payment. You should also
ensure that you are able to make all payments before the duration of the deed
ends. </p>

<p>Payments as specified in the deed must be paid on the date(s) that are
specified and for the amount that is specified. Neither the person paying or
receiving the money can alter the payments during the period of the deed. </p>

<h3>Making a payment under a deed of covenant</h3>

<p>The person making the payment (the covenantor) must deduct tax at the
standard rate from the total (gross) payment. </p>

<p>Individuals paying tax under the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system can account
for the tax deducted by having their certificates of tax credits and standard
rate cut-off point amended by their tax office. If you are self-assessed, you
should account for the deed of covenant in your annual assessment that you
submit to Revenue. </p>

<p>You must also give details of the payment and tax deducted on a Form R185 to
the person receiving the payment (the covenantee) each time a payment is made.

<p>The exact tax saving will depend on the amount of tax that is paid by the
covenantor (the person paying the money), and on the income of the covenantee
(the person receiving the payment). </p>

<p>If the person paying the money is liable to tax at a higher rate than the
standard, then they will receive tax relief at the difference between the
standard rate and the higher rate. The standard rate is 20% and the higher rate
is 41%.</p>

<p>There is no tax benefit to the covenantor who pays tax at the standard rate
only. </p>

<p>Regardless of the financial situation of the person paying the money (the
covenantor), the person receiving the payment (the covenantee) whose tax
chargeable on their total income (including the gross income received under the
deed of covenant) is less than their annual tax credits would qualify for a
refund of the standard rate tax deducted by the covenantor.</p>

<h3>Tax relief for the covenantee</h3>

tax relief Revenue, again quoting their PPS number. For a first claim for tax
relief, include a copy of the deed of covenant, <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it7.html">Form 54 claims and a

<p>Tax credits reduce the amount of tax you have to pay. You can read about <a shape="rect" href="../income_tax/how_your_tax_is_calculated.html">how your
income tax is calculated</a> for an explanation of how tax credits work. This
document explains the tax credits that apply to the income of a deceased
person. It also explains the tax credits and reliefs that are available to a
widowed person or surviving civil partner. You can get more information about

death</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="ld4bf3">The year of death</h2>

<h3>Single people</h3>

<p>In the year in which they die, a single person has the normal tax credits to
which they are entitled for the whole year, January to December. (Widowed
people and surviving civil partners are treated in the same way.) If a refund
of tax is due, it can be claimed by the person responsible for finalising the
affairs of the deceased.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/unmarried_couples/">Unmarried couples</a> are
treated as single for tax purposes.</p>

<h3>Married couples and civil partners</h3>

<p>If your spouse or civil partner dies, the way you are taxed in that year
depends on how you were taxed as a couple. That is, whether you were taxed
through Single Assessment, Separate Assessment or Joint Assessment. For more
information on these options see the information on the <a shape="rect" href="../income_tax/taxation_of_married_people.html">taxation of married people
and civil partners</a>.</p>

<h4>Single assessment</h4>

<p>If you were both taxed as single persons then the Widowed Person's or
Surviving Civil Partner's Tax Credit (see below) will replace the personal tax
credit you had at the start of the year. </p>

<h4>Separate assessment</h4>

<p>If you and your spouse or civil partner were taxed under separate assessment
then the Widowed Person's or Surviving Civil Partner's Tax Credit will replace
your personal tax credit. You may also be entitled to unused tax credits that
were allocated to your spouse or civil partner.</p>

<h3>Joint assessment</h3>

<p>If a married couple is jointly assessed for tax, the spouse or civil partner
with the obligation to make tax returns, etc., is known as the <em>assessable
spouse</em> or <em>nominated civil partner</em>. The assessable spouse or
nominated civil partner is the person the couple has nominated as such. If no
one has been nominated, the assessable person is the spouse or civil partner
with the higher income and remains the assessable spouse or nominated civil
partner until a decision is made to the contrary.</p>

<p>The tax treatment of a married couple jointly assessed to tax in the year
where one spouse dies depends on whether the assessable spouse or the
non-assessable spouse dies.</p>

<p><strong>Death of the non-assessable spouse</strong></p>

<p>In the tax year in which a non assessable spouse dies, the assessable spouse
</p>
<ul><li>Is taxable on his/her own total income for the full year plus the total
    income of his/her spouse to the date of death </li>
  <li>Is entitled to the full amount of the married tax credit and the PAYE
    credit (2 PAYE credits if both have enough income taxable under the PAYE
    system) </li>
  <li>May claim other tax credits due to both spouses in that year </li>
</ul><p><strong>Death of the assessable spouse</strong></p>

<p>For the period 1 January to the date of death, the assessable spouse:</p>
<ul><li>Is taxable on his/her own total income and the total income of his/her
    spouse for this period </li>
  <li>Is entitled to the full amount of the married tax credit and the PAYE
    credit (2 PAYE credits if both have sufficient income taxable under the
    PAYE system) </li>
  <li>May claim a proportion of other credits up to date of death </li>
  <li>Has the tax rate bands that apply to a married couple</li>
</ul><p>From the date of death to the end of the tax year, the widowed spouse:</p>
<ul><li>Is assessable on his/her own income for this period </li>
  <li>Is entitled to the widowed person’s tax credit for year of bereavement
    and the PAYE credit (if taxed on PAYE) </li>
  <li>May claim tax credits for the period following the death</li>
  <li>Has the tax rate bands that apply to a single/widowed person</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lc7074">Following the year of death</h2>

<h3>Widowed Person’s Tax Credit</h3>

<p>An increased personal tax credit is available to widowed people. The amount
of the tax credit varies according to whether or not the surviving spouse has
dependent children and how recent the bereavement was. </p>

<p><strong>Widowed person without dependent children</strong></p>

<p>A widowed person without a dependent child will still get the Married Person
or Civil Partner's Tax Credit in the year of bereavement, which is €3,300 in
2016. </p>

<p>Each year following the year of bereavement you will get the Widowed Person
or Surviving Civil Partner's Tax Credit, which is €2,190 in 2016. </p>

<p><strong>Widowed person with dependent children</strong></p>

<p>If you are a widowed person with a dependent child you will still get the
Married Person or Civil Partner's Tax Credit in the year of bereavement which
is €3,300 in 2016. In subsequent years, as long as you continue to have
dependent children you will get a <em>Widowed Person or Surviving Civil
Partner's (with dependent children) Tax Credit</em> (€1,650 in 2016) and a
Single Person Child Carer Credit (€1,650 in 2016).</p>

<p>You are also entitled to an additional tax credit, the <em>Widowed Parent or
Surviving Civil Partner Tax Credit</em>, for the first five years after the
year of death - see below. </p>

<p>If you are widowed with dependent children and have not remarried but are
cohabiting with a partner, you are not considered as a widowed person (with
dependent children) for tax purposes. This means you are not entitled to the
Widowed Person's (with dependent children) Tax Credit or the Single Person
Child Carer Credit, however, you can get the Widowed Person's Tax Credit
instead. </p>

<p>Also, if you are widowed and have not remarried but no longer have dependent
children, you will not be considered as a widowed person (with dependent
children). Instead, you will get the Widowed Person or Surviving Civil
Partner's Tax Credit.</p>

<h3>Widowed Parent or Surviving Civil Partner Tax Credit</h3>

<p>The Widowed Parent or Surviving Civil Partner Tax Credit is available for
five years, beginning in the year <strong>after</strong> the year of
bereavement. If you are bereaved in 2016 you will not get a Widowed Parent or
Surviving Civil Partner Tax Credit untill 2017. Only one Widowed Parent Tax or
Surviving Civil Partner Credit is granted, irrespective of the number of
children. The amount of the tax credit varies each year as follows:</p>

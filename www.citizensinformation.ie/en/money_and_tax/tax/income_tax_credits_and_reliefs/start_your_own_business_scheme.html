<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you have been unemployed for at least 12 months and set up a qualifying
business, the Start Your Own Business scheme provides an exemption from income
tax up to a maximum of €40,000 per annum for a period of 2 years.</p>

<p>Start Your Own Business Relief only applies to income tax payable on the
profits from your business. It does not extend to <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">PRSI</a>
and <a href="../income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">Universal Social
Charge (USC)</a> so you will be liable to pay PRSI and USC on any profits
earned in your new business. The Start Your Own Business scheme runs from 25
October 2013 to 31 December 2018.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>You may qualify for this relief if you have been unemployed and getting any
(or a combination) of the following for 12 months or more:</p>
<ul><li><a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
    Allowance</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker's
    Benefit</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/one_parent_family_payment.html">One-Parent
    Family Payment</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/partial_capacity_benefit.html">Partial
    Capacity Payment</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">Credited
    contributions</a></li>
</ul><p>If you have spent time on certain training or on employment schemes this
period will be treated as part of a period of unemployment. Examples of
training courses and schemes include <a href="../../../education/vocational_education_and_training/fas_training_courses.html">Further
Education and Training (FET) courses</a>, <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/community_employment_scheme.html">Community
Employment</a>, and the <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">Back
to Education Scheme</a>.</p>

<p>If you took up employment for a period but lost your job and returned to
your jobseeker’s payment you can qualify (provided the two jobseeker claims
are not separated by more than 12 months and your total claim is more than 12
months).</p>

<p>If you work part-time and claim a jobseeker’s payment for the other days
you can qualify for the Start Your Own Business Relief once you have been
getting a jobseeker’s payment for 312 days of unemployment.</p>

<p>You should check with <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/List-of-Social-Welfare-Local-and-Branch-Offices-by-County.aspx">your
social welfare local office or Intreo centre</a> if you are unsure whether you
meet the criteria. You can also read <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/own-business-scheme/index.html#section2">case
studies on Revenue’s website</a>.</p>

<p>If you qualify for the Start Your Own Business Relief, the following must
also apply:</p>
<ul><li>The business must be set up between 25 October 2013 and 31 December
  2018</li>
  <li>It must be a new business (not a business that is bought, inherited or
    otherwise acquired)</li>
  <li>It must be unincorporated, that is, it must not be registered as a
  company</li>
</ul><p>You can claim Start Your Own Business Relief if you are getting the <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_and_work/back_to_work_enterprise_allowance.html">Back
to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA)</a>. (However if you started to get the
BTWEA before 25 October 2013 you do not qualify for the relief because you had
already started your business before the start date for the scheme.)</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>You can claim the relief on up to €40,000 of profits each year for 2
years. How you calculate the relief depends on when you started your new
business.</p>

<p><strong>Year 1:</strong> You do not have to pay income tax on your profits
if they are less than the cap. If you start your new business in January (and
you use the calendar year as your accounting year) the cap for the year is
€40,000. If you start your business later in the year then the cap will be
reduced proportionately according to the month you start. For example if you
start your business in February, 11 months remain in the year so you can earn
up €36,667 (11/12 of €40,000). If you start your business in December, one
month remains in the year so you can earn up to €3,333 (1/12 of
€40,000).</p>

<p><strong>Year 2:</strong> You do not have to pay income tax on your profits
if they are less than the cap of €40,000. The accounts for the second year
will always be for a period of 12 months.</p>

<p><strong>Year 3:</strong> Profits for any part of this year which fall within
the first 24 months of business are income tax free once they are less than the
cap. The cap for year 3 is calculated as €40,000 x [months left to claim] /
12. If you started your business in January, then you have used up the 24
months relief in Year 1 and Year 2 and there is no relief available for Year 3.
If you started your business later in the year then there is still some relief
available.</p>

<p>If you make a loss in your first year of trading you can claim Start Your
Own Business Relief before you claim relief for losses in following years. This
ensures that if you make a loss you receive actual value for those losses in
future years rather than having to set those losses against profits which would
not have been subject to income tax under the Start Your Own Business
scheme.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You do not need to be preapproved for the scheme. Instead, you claim this
relief when you make your income tax return. Note that new businesses get an
extension to the normal filing date for your first tax return. For example if
you set up your new business in 2014 then your first tax return is not due
until 31 October 2016.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/ros/index.html">Revenue's Online
Service (ROS)</a> can calculate the amount of income tax, USC and PRSI that you
owe.</p>

<p>If you do not want to use ROS to file your tax return and if you file a
paper tax return before 31 August, Revenue will send you a calculation of the
amount of tax, USC and PRSI you owe.</p>

<p>The Start Your Own Business Relief only applies to income tax payable on the
profits from your business. It does not extend to PRSI and Universal Social
Charge (USC) so you will be liable to pay PRSI and USC on any profits earned in
your new business.</p>

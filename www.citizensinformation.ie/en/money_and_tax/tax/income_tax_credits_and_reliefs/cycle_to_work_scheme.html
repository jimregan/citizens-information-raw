<p>The <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/what-constitutes-pay/items-not-treated-as-pay/provision-of-bicycles-for-directors-and-employees.aspx">Cycle
to Work Scheme is a tax incentive scheme</a> which aims to encourage employees
to cycle to and from work. Under the scheme employers can pay for bicycles and
bicycle equipment for their employees and the employee pays back through a
salary sacrifice arrangement of up to 12 months. The employee is not liable for
<a href="../income_tax/how_your_tax_is_calculated.html">tax, PRSI or the
Universal Social Charge</a> on their repayments.</p>

<p>Your employer does not have to take part in the scheme. However if they do,
they must offer it to all their employees. Self-employed people are not
eligible for the scheme (unless they are paying PRSI as an employee in addition
to their self-employment).</p>

<p><strong>What equipment does the scheme apply to?</strong></p>

<p>The scheme applies to new bicycles and pedelecs (electrically assisted
bicycles which require some effort from the cyclist). It does not cover
motorbikes, scooters or mopeds.</p>

<p>Purchase of the following new safety equipment is also covered:</p>
<ul><li>Cycle helmets which conform to European standard EN 1078</li>
  <li>Bells and bulb horns</li>
  <li>Lights, including dynamo packs</li>
  <li>Mirrors and mudguards to ensure that the rider’s visibility is not
    impaired</li>
  <li>Cycle clips and dress guards</li>
  <li>Panniers, luggage carriers and straps to allow luggage to be safely
    carried</li>
  <li>Locks and chains to ensure cycle can be safely secured</li>
  <li>Pumps, puncture repair kits, cycle tool kits and tyre sealant to allow
    for minor repairs</li>
  <li>Reflective clothing along with white front reflectors and spoke
  reflectors</li>
</ul><p><strong>How do I pay for the bicycle?</strong></p>

<p>Usually your employer pays the supplier for the bicycle and sets up a
‘salary sacrifice’ arrangement from your salary over an agreed time frame
(which cannot be more than 12 months). This generally means that you visit the
shop, select the equipment you wish to buy and have the shop invoice your
employer directly for the cost. Note that the tax exemption does not apply if
you pay for the bicycle and are reimbursed by your employer – they
<strong>must</strong> pay for the bicycle.</p>

<p>The repayment for the bicycle and equipment is then deducted from your gross
salary (this means before income tax, PRSI, pension levies or Universal Social
Charge are deducted). These deductions can be made weekly, fortnightly or
monthly depending on your salary payment arrangement. Your employer can also
buy the bicycle on your behalf and not require you to pay for it. In this
instance, you will be exempt from benefit-in-kind taxation to a cost of
€1,000. If the cost of the bicycle exceeds this amount a benefit-in-kind
charge will apply to the balance.</p>

<p><strong>How often can I use the scheme?</strong></p>

<p>You can only avail of the scheme once in a five-year period. This applies
even if you do not purchase equipment up to the €1,000 limit. The tax year in
which the bicycle or equipment is provided counts as the first year. So, if you
used the scheme in 2014 (regardless of the month) you would be entitled to the
relief again during 2019 (from January).</p>

<p><strong>Qualifying journeys</strong></p>

<p>You must use the bicycle and safety equipment mainly for qualifying
journeys. This means the whole or part (for example between home and train
station) of a journey between your home and your normal place of work.
Employers do not have to monitor this but you will be asked to sign a statement
saying that the bicycle is for your own use and will be mainly used for
qualifying journeys.</p>

<p>There is a limit of €1,000 on the amount that can be spent (this includes
bicycles, safety equipment and delivery charges). If you spend more than this
limit you are liable for a <a href="../income_tax/taxation_of_benefits_from_employment.html">benefit-in-kind
income tax charge</a>.</p>

<p>You can find out more about the scheme on <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/paye/guide/employers-guide-paye-definition.html#section6.6">the
Revenue Commissioner’s website</a>.</p>

<p>You can claim tax relief on certain housing expenses. </p>

<p>There is also a new tax refund scheme, which is designed to help first-time
buyers of newly built homes to assemble the required deposit. Read more in our
document on the <a href="../../../housing/owning_a_home/help_with_buying_a_home/help_to_buy_incentive.html">Help

Renovation Incentive (HRI)</a> provides an income tax credit to homeowners and

<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l7709a">Tax relief for tenants</h2>

<p>If you live in private rented accommodation and pay income tax, you may be
eligible for tax relief on part of your rent. More information is available in
our document on <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/renting_a_home/tax_relief_for_tenants.html">tax issues for
tenants</a>. This scheme only applies to people who were renting on 7 December
2010.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="lcf158">Tax relief for landlords</h2>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it70.html">deduct
the interest on money borrowed to purchase, improve or repair rented
residential property</a> when working out your rental income for tax purposes.
</p>

<p>You must show that you have registered all tenancies in the property with
the <a href="../../../housing/renting_a_home/private_residential_tenancies_board.html">Residential
Tenancies Board (RTB)</a>. Interest can only be deducted during the period in
which the property is let.</p>

<p>For residential properties, this deduction is restricted to 75% of the
interest accruing on loans. Interest is treated as accruing on a daily basis
and the date the loan was taken out is not relevant.</p>

<p><strong>Budget 2017:</strong> this deduction is being increased to 80%.</p>

<h3>Extra relief</h3>

<p>Since January 2016, landlords who rent residential property for 3 years to
tenants getting social housing supports (called qualifying tenants) can deduct
<strong>all</strong> of the interest that accrues during that 3-year period.
Social housing supports include the <a href="../../../housing/renting_a_home/housing_assistance_payment.html">Housing
Assistance Payment</a>, the <a href="../../../housing/local_authority_and_social_housing/rental_accommodation_scheme.html">Rental
Accommodation Scheme</a> and <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_schemes/rent_supplement.html">Rent
Supplement</a>. </p>

<p>Landlords must submit an undertaking to the Residential Tenancies Board
(RTB) stating that they commit to renting a residential property to qualifying
tenants for 3 years. The RTB must register these undertakings in its <a href="../../../housing/renting_a_home/registering_a_tenancy.html">Register
of Tenancies</a>. You can get the form for <a href="http://www.prtb.ie/docs/default-source/registration-docs/declaration-of-undertaking-form-final-3.pdf?sfvrsn=4">registering
an undertaking on the RTB's website (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l3bbee">Tax relief on mortgage interest</h2>

<p><a href="/en/housing/owning_a_home/buying_a_home/mortgage_interest_relief.html">Mortgage
interest relief</a> is a tax relief based on the amount of qualifying mortgage
interest that you pay in a given tax year for your principal private residence
(your home). A tax year means the period from 1 January to 31 December.
Mortgages taken out after 31 December 2012 no longer qualify for mortgage
interest relief. </p>

<p><strong>Budget 2017:</strong> Mortgage interest relief was due to be
abolished entirely after 31 December 2017. It will now be retained beyond this
date, on a tapered basis. Details are to be announced in Budget 2018.</p>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l1af9f">Rent-a-room relief</h2>

<p>If you <a href="/en/housing/owning_a_home/home_owners/rent_a_room_scheme.html">rent out a
room or flat in your home</a> you are exempt from income tax on the amount that
your tenant pays you for rent and other services, up to €12,000 in a tax
year. The relief applies only to residential tenancies, not to short-term guest
arrangements. The relief can also apply to a self-contained unit (such as a
basement flat) if it is part of, or is directly attached to, your home. You are
not eligible for Rent-a-room relief if you are renting the room to a son or
daughter. </p>

<p><strong>Budget 2017:</strong> The ceiling for exemption from income tax
under the Rent-a-room scheme is being increased from €12,000 to €14,000 for
2017 and subsequent years.</p>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="lc3276">Tax when transferring ownership </h2>

<p>When ownership of a property is transferred, the financial gains are usually
liable to tax but some exemptions and reliefs apply. </p>

<p>For instance, when you sell a property, any profit you make over the amount
that you paid for it would usually be liable for <a href="../capital_taxes/capital_gains_tax.html">Capital Gains Tax</a>. There
is however an exemption if the property is the main residence where you live.
See <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/cgt/leaflets/cgt2.pdf">Revenue leaflet CGT2
(pdf)</a> for an introduction to Capital Gains Tax or see the more detailed <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/cgt/leaflets/cgt1.pdf">Guide to
Capital Gains Tax (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>If you receive property as a gift or inheritance, you may have to pay <a shape="rect" href="../capital_taxes/capital_acquisitions_tax.html">Capital
Acquisitions Tax</a>. A number of reliefs and exemptions apply including
transfers between spouses or civil partners or the receipt of a house that has
been your main residence. </p>

<h2>Stamp duty</h2>

<p>Stamp duty is a tax that may be payable when ownership of a property is
transferred. The current rate is 1% for residential property valued up to €1
million and 2% on the balance. <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/owning_a_home/buying_a_home/stamp_duty.html">You can get further
information on stamp duty on property</a>.</p>

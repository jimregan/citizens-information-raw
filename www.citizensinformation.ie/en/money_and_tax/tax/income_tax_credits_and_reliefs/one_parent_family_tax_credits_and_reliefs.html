<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Single Person Child Carer Credit (SPCCC) is a tax credit for people who
are caring for children on their own. It came into effect on 1 January 2014.
The One-Parent Family Credit was abolished from 1 January 2014. </p>

<p>Tax credits reduce the amount of tax that you have to pay. Our document <a shape="rect" href="../income_tax/how_your_tax_is_calculated.html">How your
income tax is calculated</a> explains how tax credits work. </p>

<p>In general, the SPCCC is given to the person with whom the qualifying child
lives for the whole or greater part of the year (more than 6 months) – called
the primary claimant. If you are a primary claimant, you can surrender your
entitlement to the credit, in favour of a secondary claimant (provided the
child (or children) lives with that person for more than 100 days in a year and
the person meets all the other qualifying conditions.)</p>

<p>The main difference between the Single Person Child Carer Credit (SPCCC) and
the One-Parent Family Credit (OPFTC) is that both parents could claim a OPFTC
if the child or children lived with them for part of the year. Only one parent
can claim the SPCCC in a tax year.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The Single Person Child Carer Credit (SPCCC) can be granted to a primary
claimant or a secondary claimant (if it has been surrendered in their favour by
a primary claimant).</p>

<p>You cannot claim the SPCC (as a primary or secondary claimant) if you are:
</p>
<ul><li>Jointly assessed as a married person or civil partner</li>
  <li>Married or in a civil partnership (unless separated)</li>
  <li>Cohabiting</li>
</ul><p>You cannot claim the SPCCC for the year in which you became widowed or a
surviving civil partner (the year of bereavement) during which you were in
receipt of the basic personal tax credit of €3,300. You can claim the SPCCC
in subsequent years if you qualify.</p>

<h3>Primary claimant</h3>

<p>The <em>primary claimant</em> is the person with whom a qualifying child
(see below) or children lives for more than 6 months of the year. The primary
claimant must be either the child’s parent or the person who takes care of
the child and who maintains the child at his or her own expense for the whole
or greater part of the year. If both parents have equal custody (by court
order) entitlement to the credit is decided by which parent gets <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child
Benefit</a> from the Department of Social Protection. A child who is living
away from home while attending college is considered a qualifying child if they
are still maintained by the claimant and return home outside of term-time.</p>

<h3>Secondary claimant</h3>

<p>A primary claimant can <em>surrender</em> (give up) the Single Person Child
Carer Credit (SPCCC) in favour of a <em>secondary claimant</em>. A secondary
claimant must meet exactly the same conditions except for the condition that
the child lives with him or her for the greater part of the year. </p>

<p>The child must live with the secondary claimant for at least 100 days in the
year. For the purpose of this limit a day can include the greater part of a
day. So, for example, if a child stays with the secondary claimant from
Saturday morning until Sunday evening, this can be counted as 2 days. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Qualifying child</h3>

<p>A <em>qualifying child</em> is a child:</p>
<ul><li>Who is born in the tax year, or</li>
  <li>Who is aged under 18 at the start of the tax year, or</li>
  <li>Who is aged over 18 at the start of the tax year but receiving full-time
    instruction at any university, college, school or other educational
    establishment</li>
</ul><p>A qualifying child can also be a person over 18 who is permanently
incapacitated - either before age 21 (or after age 21 while they were receiving
full-time instruction). There is an additional <a shape="rect" href="../tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/incapacitated_child_tax_credit.html">Incapacitated
Child Tax Credit</a>. </p>
</div>
The child may be your own child, an adopted child, a stepchild or any child
that you support and maintain at your own expense. This means having day-to-day
responsibility for the upbringing of the child and responsibility for his or
her charge and care. However, foster children cannot be qualifying children. 

<h4>Surrendering your entitlement</h4>

<p>If you are the primary claimant and you do not wish to claim the credit, you
can <em>surrender</em> (give up) your entitlement to the credit. This surrender
will remain in place until you withdraw it. You will then have the credit
restored to you at the beginning of the following tax year. (For example, if
you withdraw your surrender on 15 May 2014, the SPCCC will be restored for tax
years 2015 onwards).</p>

<h4>Can both parents claim a Single Person Child Carer Credit?</h4>

<p>Only one credit for any qualifying child is available to the primary
claimant. If you have more than one qualifying child you can only get one
Single Person Child Carer Credit (SPCCC) for those children. </p>

<p>However if you are a primary claimant with more than one qualifying child
and you surrender your entitlement to the SPCCC, 2 or more secondary claimants
can claim the credit – provided they are caring for qualified children for
more than 100 days in a year. For example, Jack has 2 children, Susan and Joan,
and is a qualifying primary claimant. Susan lives with her mother Mary for more
than 100 days in a year and Joan lives with her mother Denise for more than 100
days in a year. Children must reside with the secondary claimant for at least
100 days in a year. If Jack surrenders his entitlement to the SPCCC, Mary and
Denise can each claim a SPCCC (provided they satisfy the other criteria).</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The Single Person Child Carer Credit (SPCCC) is €1,650 in 2016.</p>

<p>A person who gets the SPCCC is also entitled to an €4,000 extension in the
standard rate band which increases the rate band from €33,800 to
€37,800.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>The Single Person Child Carer Credit (SPCCC) was introduced from 1 January
2014. In 2014, Revenue automatically allocated the new SPCCC to people who are
getting Child Benefit from the Department of Social Protection and who were due
to receive a One-Parent Family Tax Credit for 2014. This approach was taken on
the assumption that Child Benefit is generally payable to the parent with whom
the child resides for most of the time. Anyone else entitled to the credit will
be required to make a claim for it. </p>

<p></p>

<p>You can claim the SPCCC online using Revenue's PAYE Anytime service which is
accessed through Revenue's <a href="https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html">myAccount</a>. You can also
claim the credit by completing <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/forms/spcc1.pdf">Form SPCC1 (pdf)</a> and
sending it to Revenue. However you cannot surrender the SPCCC to a secondary
claimant using PAYE Anytime. </p>

<p></p>

<p>However there are some situations where Revenue may not allocate the credit
correctly.</p>

<p></p><ol><li>If you are a primary claimant and were not allocated the credit but wish
    to claim it you should complete <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/forms/spcc1.pdf">Form SPCC1 (pdf)</a>
    and submit it to your Revenue office.</li>
  <li>If you are allocated the credit but are not entitled to it because, for
    example, the child is not receiving full-time instruction, then you must
    notify your Revenue office of your change in circumstances as soon as
    possible and request that the credit be withdrawn.</li>
  <li>If you were allocated the credit but wish to surrender it to a secondary
    claimant then you should complete <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/forms/spcc1.pdf">Form SPCC1
    (pdf)</a>, sign the appropriate declaration and submit it to your Revenue
    office.</li>
  <li>If you qualify as a secondary claimant and the primary claimant has
    surrendered the credit in your favour, then the primary claimant should
    complete <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/forms/spcc1.pdf">Form
    SPCC1 (pdf)</a>, sign the appropriate declaration and submit it to his or
    her Revenue office. You should complete <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/forms/spcc2.pdf">Form SPCC2 (pdf)</a>
    and submit it to your Revenue office.</li>
  <li>If you believe you qualify as the primary claimant but the credit has
    been granted automatically to another individual you should complete <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/forms/spcc1.pdf">Form SPCC1 (pdf)</a>
    and submit it to your Revenue office together with any relevant evidence in
    support of your claim that the child lives with you for the whole or
    greater part of the year. The decision on who is the primary claimant will
    be made on the facts in the case. In the event of a dispute you can appeal
    Revenue's determination to the Appeal Commissioners.</li>
</ol><p>Remember that, for a secondary claimant to make a claim, in all cases the
primary claimant must have surrendered their entitlement to the credit. There
is no obligation on the primary claimant to give up the SPCCC.</p>

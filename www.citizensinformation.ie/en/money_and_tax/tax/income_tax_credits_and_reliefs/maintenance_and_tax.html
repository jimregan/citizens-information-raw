<p>The effect of separation on each spouse's tax liability depends chiefly on
whether there are any maintenance payments involved and, if so, whether these
payments are made under a legally enforceable arrangement or not. </p>

<p>If maintenance payments are made, for the benefit of a spouse, under a
legally enforceable arrangement during the year in which the couple separates
then: </p>
<ul><li>The spouse who makes the payments is entitled to a tax deduction for the
    payments </li>
  <li>The spouse to whom the maintenance is paid is taxed on the payments. </li>
</ul><p>Where a couple separates and no maintenance payments are made, each spouse
is taxed as a single person and is responsible for filing his/her own tax
return and paying tax on his/her own income. </p>
</div>
You can read Revenue's leaflet on <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it3.html#section3">What to do
about tax on the breakdown of a marriage, civil partnership or cohabiting
relationship</a> to find out about the tax treatment of civil partners. <div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Tax treatment of voluntary maintenance payments</h3>

<p>Voluntary maintenance payments (i.e., payments that are not legally
enforceable) are <span>not</span> taken into account when calculating either
spouse's tax. This means that:</p>
<ul><li>The spouse who makes the payments is not entitled to a tax deduction for
    them </li>
  <li>The spouse who receives the payments is not taxed on them </li>
  <li>Both spouses are taxed on their own income as single people. </li>
</ul><p>Where a spouse:</p>
<ul><li>Makes voluntary maintenance payments to the other spouse </li>
</ul><p>and</p>
<ul><li>Is not entitled to a tax deduction for the payments because they were not
    made under a legally enforceable arrangement </li>
</ul><p>and </p>
<ul><li>The payments are sufficient to either wholly or mainly maintain his/her
    spouse, </li>
</ul><p>he/she will qualify for the married person's tax credit but only the single
person's standard rate cut-off point is due. The other spouse can also claim
the single person's tax credit against his/her own income (if any). </p>

<p>"Mainly Maintaining" means that the payer's maintenance payments exceed the
recipient's income. </p>

<h3>Legally enforceable maintenance arrangements</h3>

<p>Legally enforceable maintenance arrangements include annual or periodic
maintenance payments made under an order of court, deed of separation, rule of
court, trust, covenant or any other act that gives rise to a <span>legally
enforceable obligation</span>. The maintenance arrangement must be made or
carried out in consideration or in consequence of a separation. </p>

<p>Maintenance payments that are made under a legally enforceable arrangement
entered into on or after 8 June 1983 are payable without deduction of tax. The
following rules apply to maintenance payments made for the benefit of a
spouse:</p>
<ul><li>The payments are made without deduction of tax (gross) </li>
  <li>The spouse who makes the payments is entitled to a tax deduction for them
  </li>
  <li>The spouse who receives the maintenance payments is liable for tax on
    them </li>
  <li>Both spouses are taxed as single people (unless they choose to be taxed
    as a married couple). </li>
</ul><p>A separated couple can choose to be treated as a married couple for income
tax purposes if:</p>
<ul><li>They are both resident in the State </li>
</ul><p>and</p>
<ul><li>Maintenance payments are made under a legally enforceable arrangement.
  </li>
</ul><p>The couple must submit a joint election in writing if they wish to avail of
this option. The election must be made in writing before the end of the tax
year and must be signed by both parties. If such an election is made, the
maintenance payments are ignored, i.e., the spouse making the payments does not
get a tax deduction for them and the spouse who receives the payments is not
liable for tax on them. </p>

<p>Where both spouses possess income, separate assessment will apply, i.e., tax
credits and standard rate cut-off point will be apportioned between the
spouses, subject to a review at the end of the year to ensure that any unused
tax credit or relevant rate bands are given to the other spouse. </p>

<p>Where only one spouse has income, the full tax credits, reliefs and the
maximum standard rate cut-off point (for couples with one spouse working) will
be given to that spouse. </p>

<p>For details and examples of the different types of assessment see <a shape="rect" href="../income_tax/taxation_of_married_people.html">Taxation of
married people and civil partners in Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>Maintenance payments that are made for the benefit of a child or children
are ignored for tax purposes:</p>
<ul><li>The payments are made without deduction of tax (gross) </li>
  <li>The person making the payments is <span>not</span> entitled to a tax
    deduction for the payments </li>
  <li>The payments are <span>not</span> taxable </li>
  <li>The payments are <span>not</span> regarded as income of the child. </li>
</ul><p>Each spouse may be entitled to claim <a shape="rect" href="../tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/incapacitated_child_tax_credit.html">an
Incapacitated Child Credit</a> (or see <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it18.pdf">Leaflet IT18
(pdf)</a>). The <a href="one_parent_family_tax_credits_and_reliefs.html">Single Person Child
Carer Credit (SPCCC)</a> can be claimed by the person with whom the child or
children live for the whole or greater part of the year (more than 6 months)
– called the primary claimant. A primary claimant can surrender his or her
entitlement to the credit, in favour of a secondary claimant (provided the
child (or children) lives with that person for more than 100 days in a year and
the person meets all the other qualifying conditions.)</p>

<p>If you are receiving maintenance payments and you also have income that is
subject to PAYE, it may be possible to collect some or all of the tax due on
the maintenance by reducing your tax credits. </p>

<p>If you are receiving maintenance payments only, the tax due is payable
directly in one lump sum under the self assessment procedures. In calculating
your finances, you should take into account the payment of any tax that is due
and the fact that this amount may have to be paid in one lump sum. </p>

<p>Where a couple obtain an Irish divorce, the provisions as outlined above
will apply to any maintenance arrangements made by order of the court, which
means that: </p>
<ul><li>Maintenance payments are made without deduction of tax </li>
  <li>The spouse who makes the payments is entitled to a tax deduction for them
  </li>
  <li>The spouse who receives the maintenance is taxable on the payments </li>
  <li>Both spouses are taxed as single persons. </li>
</ul><p>A divorced couple also has the option of being treated as a married couple
(the separate assessment provisions will apply) for income tax purposes if:</p>
<ul><li>They are both resident in the State </li>
</ul><p>and</p>
<ul><li>Neither spouse has remarried. </li>
</ul><h3>Annullment of marriage</h3>

<p>If a marriage is annulled, each spouse will be taxed as a single person from
the date of the annullment onwards. The couple cannot make an election for
joint assessment. </p>

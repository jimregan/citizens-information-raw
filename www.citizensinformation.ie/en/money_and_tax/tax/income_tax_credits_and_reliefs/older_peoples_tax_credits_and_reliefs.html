<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>If you are aged 65 or over, you are liable to pay income tax in the normal
way. However, there are tax exemption limits for people aged 65 or over and
there are some extra tax credits.</p>

<p>It is possible to get tax relief for covenants to people aged 65 and
over.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances, you may be able to reclaim any <a shape="rect" href="../tax_on_savings_and_investments/deposit_interest_retention_tax.html">DIRT
(Deposit Interest Retention Tax)</a> paid.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Income tax applies to almost all income. People aged 65 and over are subject
to the same general tax rules as everyone else but they do get tax exemption
limits below which they pay no tax and some extra tax credits. </p>

<p>The way in which pensions and some other social welfare payments are taxed
is described in our documents about <a shape="rect" href="../../personal_finance/pensions/taxation_of_pensions.html">taxation of
pensions</a> and <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">taxation
of social welfare payments</a>. </p>

<p>The tax relief available for pension contributions and the tax treatment of
personal pensions are described in <a shape="rect" href="../../personal_finance/pensions/personal_pensions.html">Personal
pensions</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../../personal_finance/pensions/occupational_pensions.html">Occupational
pensions</a>.</p>

<p>Tax credits for health insurance and long-term care insurance and tax relief
for medical expenses are described in our document about <a shape="rect" href="taxation_and_medical_expenses.html">taxation and medical care</a>. </p>

<p>In general, if you are taxed exclusively under PAYE (this includes people
whose non-PAYE income is taxed by having it coded into their determination of
tax credits) you are not obliged to make an annual return. </p>

<p>If you are not taxed under PAYE (i.e. you are taxed under the
self-assessment system) you are obliged to make an annual return by 31 October
each year.</p>

<h3>Tax exemption limits for people aged 65 and over</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it8.html">Exemption
limits</a> are income limits below which no tax is payable. </p>

<p><strong>Annual exemption limits for people aged 65 and over</strong></p>

<table border="1" width="298" cellpadding="1" summary="Annual tax exemption limits for people aged 65 and over" cellspacing="1"><thead><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>Status </strong></td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>2017</strong></td>
    </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Single or widowed or surviving civil
      partner</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€18,000</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Married or in a civil partnership</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€36,000</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">First two children</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€575 each</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Subsequent children</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">€830 each</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>If you expect that your income for the year will be less than these limits,
you should contact Revenue and they will issue a revised determination of tax
credits to you. If your income is not much above these amounts, you may get
what is called "marginal relief". That means that you do not go back into the
normal tax system - instead you pay tax at a rate of 40% on the amount by which
your income exceeds your relevant exemption. </p>

<p>The point at which marginal relief ceases to be of benefit varies with your
family circumstances and the tax credits to which you are entitled.</p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/tax-chart.html">You
can find more information about income tax exemptions and marginal relief on
Revenue's website</a>.</p>

<h3>Tax credits</h3>

<p>Tax credits are only relevant if you have a taxable income. Tax credits
reduce the amount of income tax that you have to pay. <a shape="rect" href="../income_tax/how_your_tax_is_calculated.html">How your tax is
calculated</a> depends on your income. Your tax credits are deducted from the
gross tax to get the amount of tax that you have to pay. </p>

<p>Everyone is entitled to a personal tax credit at either the married/in a
civil partnership, single or widowed/surviving civil partner rate. People who
pay tax under the PAYE (pay-as-you-earn) system also get a PAYE tax credit.
This PAYE tax credit is also available to pensioners who receive their social
security pension from another EU member state; they do not pay tax at source
but pay tax annually. People aged 65 and over also get an Age Tax Credit. </p>

<p><strong>Age Tax Credit</strong></p>

<p>This is additional to the personal tax credit and may be claimed once you or
your spouse or civil partner reaches the age of 65. </p>

<p></p>

<table border="1"><col><col><tbody><tr><td><strong>Age Tax Credit</strong></td>
      <td><strong>2017</strong></td>
    </tr><tr><td>Single or widowed or surviving civil partner</td>
      <td>€245</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Married or in a civil partnership</td>
      <td>€490</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<p>If you or your spouse or civil partner are 65 or over contact Revenue to
claim this additional tax credit.</p>

<p><strong>Dependent Relative Tax Credit</strong></p>

<p>This credit is granted to if you pay tax and maintain, at your own expense,
any person who comes within any of the following categories:</p>
<ul><li>A relative, including a relative of your spouse or civil partner, who is
    unable to maintain himself or herself as a result of old age or
  ill-health</li>
  <li>A widowed parent / surviving civil partner parent of either yourself or
    your spouse or civil partner, irrespective of the state of his/her
  health</li>
  <li>A son or daughter of either yourself or your spouse or civil partner who
    lives with you and on whose services you must depend as a result of old age
    or ill health </li>
</ul><p>The relative's own income must be below a certain amount to claim this tax
credit. More information is available in our document about <a shape="rect" href="../tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/dependent_relative_tax_credit.html">dependent
relative tax credit</a>. </p>

<h3>Allowance for employing a carer</h3>

<p>If you employ a person to take care of an incapacitated member of your
family, you may get an additional allowance. The maximum allowance is
€75,000. <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/tax_relief_for_employing_a_home_carer.html">Relief
for employing a carer is allowable at your highest rate of tax.</a> </p>

<h3>Covenants</h3>

<p>If you are a higher rate taxpayer and you want to help support a person on a
low income, it may be worthwhile to covenant the money.</p>

<p>The person to whom you covenant must be 65 or over or be permanently
incapacitated. If the conditions are met, you can claim tax relief on an amount
up to 5% of your taxable income; however, there is no limit if the person is
permanently incapacitated.</p>

<p>Covenants are most effective if the recipient does not have a taxable
income. The amount you covenant may be taxable in the hands of the recipient.
It is important to note that money covenanted to people receiving a
non-contributory pension or means-tested allowance may affect their entitlement
to the allowance in question. You can find more information about <a shape="rect" href="deeds_of_covenant.html">deeds of covenant</a>. </p>

<h3>Tax relief for rent</h3>

<p>Tax relief is available for rent paid for private rented accommodation. This
will be phased out over 7 years, starting from 2011. People over 55 can claim
relief at higher rates. <strong>You cannot claim relief if you were not renting
before 7 December 2010.</strong> You can find out more in our document about <a shape="rect" href="../../../../housing/renting_a_home/tax_relief_for_tenants.html">tax
relief for private tenants</a>. </p>

<h3>Deposit Interest Retention Tax</h3>

<p><a shape="rect" href="../tax_on_savings_and_investments/deposit_interest_retention_tax.html">Deposit
Interest Retention Tax (DIRT)</a> is deducted from the interest payable on
savings in banks, building societies, etc. This happens whether or not you
would normally be liable for tax. If you are aged 65 or over or your spouse or
civil partner is aged 65 or over or if you are permanently incapacitated, you
may not be liable for DIRT if you are exempt from income tax. </p>
You can notify your financial institution so that they can pay your interest
without deducting DIRT.<br></div>

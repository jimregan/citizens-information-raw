<p>When a married couple decide to separate and the separation is likely to be
permanent, there are implications for the way in which they are taxed. It is
important to understand the different taxation options available and how
decisions about maintenance payments will affect taxation. </p>

<p>There are a number of <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/separation_and_divorce/legal_options_following_marital_breakdown.html">legal
approaches for married couples who wish to separate</a> and the Revenue
Commissioners recognise that a couple may separate without any formal
arrangements. In that case, the couple should contact Revenue after the actual
separation, so that the necessary tax adjustments can be made for the year in
which the couple separate and for the following tax years.</p>
</div>
You can read Revenue's leaflet on <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it3.html#section3">What to do
about tax on the breakdown of a marriage, civil partnership or cohabiting
relationship</a> to find out about the tax treatment of civil partners. <div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l0f697">Taxation in the year of separation</h2>

<p>How a couple are taxed in the year in which they separate will depend on how
they were taxed as a married couple. They may have been taxed under single
assessment, separate assessment or joint assessment. For more information on
these options, <a shape="rect" href="../income_tax/taxation_of_married_people.html">read about taxation of
married people and civil partners</a>. </p>
<ul><li>If a couple are <strong>assessed as single persons</strong> , there will
    be no change in their tax assessment if they subsequently separate. </li>
  <li>If a couple are taxed under <strong>separate assessment</strong>, their
    income up to the date of separation is assessed in the usual way and they
    can transfer between them any unused <a shape="rect" href="introduction_to_income_tax_credits_and_reliefs.html">tax credits</a>
    and <a shape="rect" href="../income_tax/how_your_tax_is_calculated.html">rate bands</a> that
    apply. For the remainder of the tax year after separation each spouse will
    be treated as a single person and the <a shape="rect" href="../income_tax/how_your_tax_is_calculated.html">single person’s tax
    credit</a> will apply to their income. </li>
  <li>Under <strong>joint assessment</strong>, one spouse is accountable for
    tax purposes, the assessable spouse. </li>
</ul><p>If you are the assessable spouse, you are entitled to the married person’s
tax credit and double rate bands for the full year in which you separate. You
are taxed on your own income for the full year as well as your spouse’s
income for the year up until the date of separation. </p>

<p>If you are the spouse who was not assessable, then you will be taxed on your
own income from the date of separation. You will be entitled to the full single
person’s tax credit and taxed under the single rate bands. If there are
legally enforceable maintenance payments then you may choose instead to
continue to be taxed as a married couple. <br></p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l25a79">Taxation in subsequent years</h2>

<p>Depending on their circumstances, separated/divorced spouses may choose to
be taxed either as a married couple or as single persons after the year in
which they separate. The payment of maintenance and the type of maintenance
payments are important in deciding which tax arrangement will apply.</p>

<h3>Maintenance payments</h3>

<p>Where one spouse provides payments for the support of the other spouse
and/or children, these are known as <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/separation_and_divorce/maintenance_orders_and_agreements.html">maintenance
payments</a>. Maintenance payments may be made under informal voluntary
agreements or they may be legally enforceable. </p>

<h3>Voluntary maintenance payments </h3>

<p>Voluntary maintenance payments are ignored for tax purposes: the spouse who
makes the payment is not entitled to a tax deduction for it and the spouse
receiving the payment is not taxed on it. Both spouses are taxed as single
people on their other income. If you are paying voluntary maintenance and it is
your spouse’s main income, then you may claim the married persons tax credit,
rather than the single person’s credit, but you will still have the tax rate
band for a single person. </p>

<h3>Legally enforceable maintenance payments </h3>

<p>Legally enforceable maintenance payments include those made under a court
order or ruling, a <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/separation_and_divorce/separation_agreement.html">deed
of separation</a>, a covenant or a trust. </p>

<p>If the maintenance payment is for the <strong>benefit of a child</strong>
then it is ignored for tax purposes. The spouse who makes the payment is
<em>not entitled</em> to a tax deduction for it and the spouse receiving the
payment is <em>not taxed</em> on it. </p>

<p>A maintenance payment for the <strong>benefit of a separated spouse</strong>
is taxable for the receiving spouse. The paying spouse does not pay tax on it;
it may be deducted from their taxable income. Both spouses in this case are
taxed as single people. </p>

<p>Separated spouses may choose instead to be taxed as a married couple if
there are legally enforceable maintenance payments. In this case the payments
are ignored for tax purposes; the spouse who makes the payment is not entitled
to a tax deduction for it and the spouse receiving the payment is not taxed on
it. </p>

<p>If they wish to be taxed as a married couple they must both confirm this in
writing before the end of the tax year. To be eligible they must both be
resident in the State and there must be a legally enforceable agreement for
maintenance payments. If they are divorced, they must not have remarried. </p>

<p>The way that maintenance payments are assigned either for the benefit of the
spouse or children effects the way that the payment is taxed. This may make a
difference to the amount of money actually received so it may be important to
seek tax advice before maintenance payments are agreed. </p>

<h3>Divorce</h3>

<p>If you are divorced, your tax situation is the same as in the case of
separation.</p>

<h3>Single Parent Child Carer Credit</h3>

<p>If you are separated or divorced and you have a child that you support and
that resides with you for the greater part of the year, then you may be
eligible for the <a shape="rect" href="one_parent_family_tax_credits_and_reliefs.html">Single Parent Child Carer
Credit</a>.</p>

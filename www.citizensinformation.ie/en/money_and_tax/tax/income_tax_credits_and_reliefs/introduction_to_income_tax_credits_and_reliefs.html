<p>Tax reliefs reduce the amount of tax that you have to pay. The tax reliefs
to which you are entitled depend on your personal circumstances. </p>

<h3>How tax credits work</h3>

<p>Tax is calculated as a percentage of your income. Your tax credits are
deducted from this to give the amount of tax that you have to pay. A tax credit
has the effect of reducing your tax by the amount of the credit.</p>

<p>Everyone is entitled to a personal tax credit. There are personal tax
credits for single people, people who are married or in a civil partnership and
people who are widowed or are surviving civil partners. If you are in
employment, getting a pension or getting a <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">taxable
social welfare payment</a> (such as Jobseeker’s Benefit) you are also
entitled to the PAYE tax credit of €1,650.</p>

<p>So, for example, if you are single and in employment you are entitled to an
annual tax credit of €1,650 and the PAYE tax credit of €1,650. This means
that when the total amount of tax you owe is calculated €3,300 will be
deducted from this. In effect, this means that if you earn €16,500 or less
you do not pay any income tax (because your tax credits of €3,300 are more
than or equal to the amount of tax you are due to pay). However you may be
liable to pay <a href="../income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">Universal
Social Charge (if your income is over €13,000</a> and <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">PRSI</a>
(depending on how much you earn each week).</p>

<p>If you are married or in a civil partnership, you have the option of sharing
tax credits and tax bands between you and your spouse or civil partner. If one
spouse or civil partner works in the home caring for one or more dependent
people you may be able to claim a <a href="home_carers_tax_credit.html">Home
Carer Tax credit</a>. You can read more about <a href="../income_tax/taxation_of_married_people.html">taxation of married
people and civil partners</a>. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>How tax allowances work</h3>

<p>In some cases you can get a tax refund for specific expenses, for example,
medical expenses or mortgage interest. </p>

<p>The value of a tax allowance will depend on whether it is allowed at the
highest rate of income tax that you pay or is restricted to the standard 20%
rate. Take the example of a claim of €100. If you pay tax at 40% and you can
claim it at this rate, then it will reduce your tax by €40 (€100 x 40%). If
the highest rate of tax that you pay is 20%, or the relief is restricted to the
standard rate, then the claim of €100 will reduce your tax by €20 (€100 x
20%).</p>

<p>More information about how tax credits and allowances work is available in
our document about <a shape="rect" href="../income_tax/how_your_tax_is_calculated.html">how your income tax is
calculated</a>.</p>

<h2>Tax credits and allowances for specific circumstances and groups</h2>

<h3>One-parent families</h3>

<p>If you are caring for a dependent child on your own you can claim the <a href="one_parent_family_tax_credits_and_reliefs.html">Single Person Child
Carer Credit</a> in addition to your personal tax credit. There is also an
increase in your standard rate tax band. This means that you can earn more
before you start to pay the higher rate of tax.</p>

<h3>Older people</h3>

<p>If you are aged 65 or over, you are liable to pay income tax in the normal
way. However, there are tax exemption limits for people aged 65 or over and
there are some extra tax credits. It is possible to get tax relief for
covenants to people aged 65 and over. In certain circumstances, you may be able
to reclaim any <a href="../tax_on_savings_and_investments/deposit_interest_retention_tax.html">DIRT
(Deposit Interest Retention Tax)</a> paid.</p>

<h3>Employment-related tax reliefs</h3>

<p>Contributions to a <a shape="rect" href="../../personal_finance/pensions/">pension</a> are eligible for tax relief
at your highest rate of tax. </p>

and workers who commute to work in a different country. You can also read about

<h3>Housing tax reliefs</h3>

<p>If you rent a room in your home to a private tenant you may claim <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/owning_a_home/home_owners/rent_a_room_scheme.html">rent a room
relief</a>. If you rent your home you may be able to claim <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/renting_a_home/tax_relief_for_tenants.html">Rent Tax Credit</a>
if you meet the criteria. If you pay a mortgage, you may claim <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/owning_a_home/buying_a_home/mortgage_interest_relief.html">tax
relief on mortgage interest</a>. </p>

<p>For an overview of tax reliefs relating to housing, and for information on
taxation when transferring the ownership of a home, see <a shape="rect" href="housing_tax_credits_and_reliefs.html">housing tax credits and

<h3>Education</h3>

<p>Tax relief is available on fees paid for approved third-level courses. You

<h3>Medical expenses</h3>

<p>If you pay medical expenses that are not covered by the State or by private
health insurance, you may claim tax relief on some of those expenses. Find out
more about <a href="taxation_and_medical_expenses.html">taxation and medical
expenses</a> and about <a href="../../../health/health_services_for_older_people/tax_relief_on_nursing_home_fees_and_for_dependent_relatives.html">tax
relief on nursing home fees and for dependent relatives</a>.</p>

<p>Tax relief is also available for premiums paid for <a href="../../../health/health_insurance/private_health_insurance.html">health
insurance</a> and for long-term care insurance. The insurance company grants
this tax relief at source.</p>

<h3>Tax following a death</h3>

<p>The treatment of tax reliefs following a death depends on the civil status
of the deceased person and on the way in which he or she was taxed if married
or in a civil partnership. </p>

<p>Additional tax credits are available to widowed persons and surviving civil
partners. Find out more about <a shape="rect" href="income_tax_credits_and_reliefs_following_a_death.html">tax reliefs
following a death</a>. </p>

<h3>Separation, divorce or dissolution</h3>

<p>If a married couple divorce or separate, or civil partners separate or a
civil partnership is dissolved, this has important tax implications. Find out
more about <a shape="rect" href="sep_divorce_income_tax.html">taxation
following separation, divorce or dissolution</a>, including information about

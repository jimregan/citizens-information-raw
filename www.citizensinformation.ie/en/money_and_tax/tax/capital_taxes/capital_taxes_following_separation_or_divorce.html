<h3>Capital Gains Tax</h3>

<p><a href="capital_gains_tax.html">Capital Gains Tax (CGT)</a> is a tax on
the profit made on the disposal of any asset and is payable by the person
making the disposal. Disposal can be by way of gift or sale. </p>

<p>Transfers of assets between spouses or civil partners are exempt from CGT.
Transfers of assets between spouses or civil partners who are separated are
exempt from CGT if they are made under a separation agreement or a court
order.</p>

<p>Transfers of assets between spouses or civil partners on foot of a court
order in a <a href="../../../birth_family_relationships/separation_and_divorce/divorce_decrees.html">decree
of divorce</a> or <a href="../../../birth_family_relationships/separation_and_divorce/dissolution_decrees.html">dissolution</a>
are exempt from CGT but transfer of assets after the granting of the decree
that are not ordered by the court are not.</p>

<p>Separating couples should always seek specialist tax advice before entering
into arrangements that have Capital Gains Tax implications.</p>

<h3>Capital Acquisitions Tax</h3>

<p><a href="capital_acquisitions_tax.html">Capital Acquisitions Tax
(CAT)</a> is a tax on gifts and inheritances received by a person. The person
receiving the gift or inheritance pays the tax. The tax is paid on the open
market value of the asset being received. </p>

<p>Transfers of assets between spouses or civil partners whether by way of gift
or inheritance are exempt from CAT. Separation does not affect this exemption
but divorce or dissolution does. </p>

<p>CAT does not apply to a property transfer, ordered by a court, between
separated or divorced marriage partners but transfers of assets after the
granting of the <a href="../../../birth_family_relationships/separation_and_divorce/divorce_decrees.html">decree
of divorce</a> or <a href="../../../birth_family_relationships/separation_and_divorce/dissolution_decrees.html">dissolution</a>
that are not ordered by the court are not. </p>

<p>Separating couples should always seek specialist tax advice before entering
into arrangements that have Capital Acquisitions Tax implications. </p>

<h3>Stamp duty</h3>

<p>Stamp duty is a tax most often associated with the transfer of property
whether by way of gift or sale. Transfers of property between spouses or civil
partners are exempt from stamp duty. Transfers of property between spouses or
civil partners who are separated or divorced are exempt from stamp duty if they
are made following a court order.</p>

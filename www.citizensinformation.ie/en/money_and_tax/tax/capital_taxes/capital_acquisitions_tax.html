<p>If you receive a gift, you may have to pay gift tax on it. If you receive an
inheritance following a death, it may be liable to inheritance tax. Both these
taxes are types of Capital Acquisitions Tax. </p>

<p>The benefit (the gift or inheritance) is taxed if its value is over a
certain limit or threshold. Different tax-free thresholds apply depending on
the relationship between the disponer (the person giving the benefit) and the
beneficiary (the person receiving the benefit). There are also a number of
exemptions and reliefs that depend on the type of the gift or inheritance.</p>

<p>If you receive a gift or inheritance from your spouse or civil partner, you
are exempt from Capital Acquisitions Tax. </p>

<p>The tax applies to all property that is located in Ireland. It also applies
where the property is not located in Ireland but either the person giving the
benefit or the person receiving it are resident or ordinarily resident in
Ireland for tax purposes. </p>

<p></p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="ld5162">Group thresholds</h2>

<p>Gifts and inheritances can be received tax-free up to a certain amount. The
tax-free amount, or threshold, varies depending on your relationship to the
person giving the benefit. There are three different categories or groups. Each
has a threshold that applies to the total benefits you have received in that
category since 5 December 1991.</p>

<p><strong>Group A</strong> applies where the beneficiary, the person receiving
the benefit, is a child of the person giving it. This includes a stepchild or
an adopted child. </p>

<p>It can also include a foster child if the foster child resided with and was
under the care of the disponer and they provided the care, at their expense,
for a period or periods totalling at least 5 years before the foster child
reached the age of 18. This minimum period does not apply in the case of an
inheritance taken on the date of death of the disponer. In this case the Group
A threshold will apply provided that the foster child had been placed in the
care of the disponer prior to that date.</p>

<p>Group A also applies to parents who take an inheritance from their child but
only where the parent takes full and complete ownership of the inheritance. If
a parent receives an inheritance where he or she does not have full and
complete ownership of the benefit, or if a parent receives a gift, then Group B
applies.</p>

<p>If a parent inherits from their child, and have full and complete ownership
of the inheritance it is exempt from tax if, in the previous five years, the
child took an inheritance or gift from either parent and it was not exempt from
Capital Acquisitions Tax. In this case, no tax needs to be paid even if the
inheritance from the child is over the threshold.</p>

<p><strong>Group B</strong> applies where the beneficiary is the:</p>
<ul><li>Parent - see also Group A above </li>
  <li>Grandparent </li>
  <li>Grandchild or great-grandchild - see below</li>
  <li>Brother or sister </li>
  <li>Nephew or niece of the giver - see below</li>
</ul><p>If a grandchild is a minor (under 18 years of age) and takes a gift or
inheritance from his or her grandparent Group A may apply if the grandchild's
parent is deceased.</p>

<p>Group A may apply to a nephew or niece if he or she has worked in the
business of the person giving the benefit for the previous five years and meets
the following criteria:</p>
<ul><li>The nephew or niece must be a blood relation rather than a nephew or
    niece-in-law </li>
  <li>The gift or inheritance consists of property used in connection with the
    business, including farming, or of shares in the company. </li>
  <li>If the gift or inheritance consists of property then the nephew or niece
    must work more than 24 hours a week for the disponer at a place where the
    business is carried on, or for the company if the gift or inheritance is
    shares. But if the business is carried on exclusively by the disponer,
    their spouse and the nephew or niece then the requirement is that the
    nephew or niece work more than 15 hours a week. </li>
  <li>The relief does not apply if the benefit is taken under a discretionary
    trust. </li>
</ul><p><strong>Group C</strong> applies to any relationship not included in Group A
or Group B.</p>

<p>If you receive a benefit from a relation of your deceased spouse or civil
partner, you can be assessed with the same group as your spouse or civil
partner would be if they were receiving the benefit from their relation. For
example, if you receive a benefit from the father of your spouse or civil
partner, the group threshold would be Group C. But if you receive a benefit
from the father of your spouse or civil partner and your spouse or civil
partner is deceased, then the group threshold that applies to you would be the
same as for a child receiving a benefit from a parent, Group A. </p>

<h2>Valuation</h2>
The valuation date is the date on which the market value of the property
comprising the gift/inheritance is established. 

<p>In the case of a <em>gift</em>, the valuation date is normally the date of
the gift.</p>

<p>In the case of an <em>inheritance</em>, the valuation date is normally the
earliest of the following dates:</p>
<ul><li>The date the inheritance can be set aside for or given to the beneficiary
  </li>
  <li>The date it is actually retained for the benefit of the beneficiary </li>
  <li>The date it is transferred or paid over to the beneficiary </li>
</ul><p>The valuation date will normally be the date of death in the following
circumstances:</p>
<ul><li>Gift made in contemplation of death (Donatio Mortis Causa) </li>
  <li>Where a power of revocation has not been exercised. This could arise
    where a person makes a gift of property but reserves the power to revoke,
    or take back, the gift. If he or she dies and this power ceases, the
    recipient then becomes taxable as inheriting the benefit. If the
    beneficiary had free use of the benefit before this, he or she will be
    taxed as receiving a gift of the value of the use of the property. </li>
</ul><h2>Taxable value</h2>

<p>The gift or inheritance is valued as the market value at the time you become
entitled to the use or benefit of it. </p>

<p>The value that is taxable is the market value minus the following
deductions.</p>

<p>You can deduct 'any liabilities, costs and expenses that are properly
payable. This would include debts that must, by law, be paid and that are
payable out of the benefit or because of it. With an inheritance, these may be
funeral expenses, the costs of administering the estate, or debts owed by the
deceased. For a gift, they could include legal costs or stamp duty.</p>

<p>If you make a payment for the benefit or some other contribution in return
for it, this may also be deducted. This is known as a 'consideration' and could
be, for example, a part payment, an amount paid annually to the donor or other
person, or a payment of debts of the donor.</p>

<p>If you do not receive full ownership but instead receive a benefit for a
limited period, then a number of factors are taken into account to calculate
the value. The calculation of the value of a limited interest is explained in
<a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/cat/leaflets/it39-2003-edition.pdf">Revenue
Guide IT 39 (pdf)</a> (Appendix 7).</p>

<h2>Tax rate</h2>

<p>Capital Acquisitions Tax is charged at 33% on gifts or inheritances made on
or after 5 December 2012 (the rate was formerly 30%). This only applies to
amounts over the group threshold. For example, if you have received gifts from
your parents with a taxable value of €550,000, you only pay tax on the amount
over the appropriate group threshold (Group A threshold from 12 October 2016:
€310,000). So €240,000 is taxed at 33%.</p>

<h2>Exemptions</h2>

<p>The following are exempt from Capital Acquisitions Tax:</p>
<ul><li>Gifts or inheritances from a spouse or civil partner</li>
  <li>Payments for damages or compensation </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/practitioner/ebrief/archive/2011/no-732011.html">Benefits
    used only for the medical expenses of a person who is permanently
    incapacitated due to physical or mental illness</a> </li>
  <li>Benefits taken for charitable purposes or received from a charity </li>
  <li>Winnings from a lottery, sweepstake, game, or betting </li>
  <li>Retirement benefits and pension and redundancy payments are not usually
    liable to Gift Tax</li>
</ul><p>The first €3,000 of the total value of all gifts received from one person
in any calendar year is exempt. This does <strong>not</strong> apply to
inheritances.</p>

<p>If you receive a gift or inheritance of a house that has been your main
residence, it may be exempt from tax if you do not own or have an interest in
any other house. There are conditions on how long you must be resident in the
house before and after receiving the benefit. More information is available on
this website - see 'Dwelling-house exemption' below - or <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/cat/leaflets/cat10.html">Revenue's leaflet
CAT 10.</a></p>

<p>If a parent receives an inheritance from his/her child, and takes full and
complete ownership of the inheritance, it usually taxable under Group A. But it
is exempt if, in the previous 5 years, the child took an inheritance or gift
from either parent and it was not exempt from Capital Acquisitions Tax.</p>

<p>Other exemptions relate to certain Irish Government securities, bankruptcy,
heritage property, and support of a child or spouse. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/cat/guide/exemptions.html">You can get
further information on reliefs and exemptions from Revenue</a>.</p>

<h2>Reliefs</h2>

<p><strong>Business relief</strong> <br>
Tax relief applies to gifts and inheritances of business property and reduces
the taxable value of the property by 90%. More information on business relief
can be found in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/cat/leaflets/cat4.html">Revenue leaflet CAT
4</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Agricultural relief </strong><br>
Tax relief applies to gifts and inheritances of agricultural property and
reduces the market value of the property by 90% for the purposes of Capital
Acquisitions Tax. More information on agricultural relief can be found in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/cat/leaflets/cat5.html">Revenue
leaflet CAT 5</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lfdcc4">Making a return and paying Capital
Acquisitions Tax</h2>

<p>If you have received a gift or inheritance then you are responsible for
paying any Capital Acquisitions Tax that is due. If you are not resident in
Ireland, you must get an agent who is resident in Ireland, such as a solicitor,
to take responsibility for the payment of CAT.</p>

<p>You must make a tax return if the total value of gifts and inheritances you
have received in one of the groups, A, B or C, since 5 December 1991 is more
than 80% of the tax-free threshold for that group.</p>

<p>For example, if you received a gift of €20,000 from a brother and then an
inheritance of €10,000 from a grandparent, both of these benefits would come
under Group B and amount to a total of €30,000. The threshold for Group B is
currently €32,500 and 80% of this is €26,000. Because the benefits you
received exceed 80% of the tax-free threshold for Group B, you are required to
make a tax return even though the total amount received is below the
threshold.</p>

<p><strong>Pay and File dates for CAT</strong></p>

<p>Taxable gifts or inheritances with a valuation date on or after 14 June 2010
have a fixed CAT pay and file date. All gifts and inheritances with a valuation
date in the 12-month period ending on the 31 August must be paid and filed by
31 October. </p>

<p>This means, if the valuation date is between 1 January and 31 August, you
must complete the tax return and pay the tax on or before 31 October in that
year. If the valuation date is between 1 September and 31 December you must
complete the tax return and pay the tax on or before 31 October in the
following year. </p>

<p></p>

<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" border="1" width="600" summary="Example of pay and file dates for CAT"><thead><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>For example</strong></td>
    </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>If your inheritance has a valuation date
        of 21 February 2017, you must complete the tax return and pay the tax
        on or before 31 October 2017.</p>

        <p>If your inheritance has a valuation date of 6 November 2017, you
        must complete the tax return and pay the tax on or before 31 October
        2018.</p>
      </td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>There is a surcharge for late pay and file of CAT. The surcharge is based on
a percentage of the total tax payable for the year the return is late and
graded according to the length of the delay. However, there is an overall cap
on the level of the surcharge which is calculated as follows: </p>
<ul><li>5% surcharge to a maximum of €12,695, if you complete the tax return
    and pay the tax within 2 months of the pay and file date. </li>
  <li>10% surcharge up to a maximum of €63,485, if you do not complete the
    tax return and pay the tax within 2 months of the pay and file date.</li>
</ul><p>Gift and inheritance tax returns must be made electronically using <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/ros/index.html">Revenue’s
Online Service</a>, however there are some exceptions. A new paper gift and
inheritance tax return (Form IT38S) will be available but can only be used by
you, the taxpayer, if you meet the following criteria: </p>
<ul><li>You are not claiming any relief, exemption or credit, apart from small
    gift exemption.</li>
  <li>The benefit taken is an absolute interest without conditions or
    restrictions.</li>
  <li>The property included in the return was taken from only one disponer and
    is not part of a larger benefit.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Special circumstances</strong></p>

<p>In certain circumstances, it is possible to pay the tax by instalments over
a period not exceeding 60 months. This applies to any property where the
beneficiary does not have full and complete ownership.</p>

<p>It also applies if the benefit is full and complete ownership of the
following:</p>
<ul><li>Property which cannot be moved (for example, lands or a house) or </li>
  <li>Property which can be moved and is agricultural or business property </li>
</ul><p>Revenue can consider allowing a postponement of tax due if there is hardship
involved.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Gifts or inheritances with a valuation date before 14 June
2010</strong></p>

<p>You must complete the tax return and pay the tax within 4 months of the
valuation date. You do this by completing <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/cat/forms/it38.pdf">Form IT 38 (pdf)</a>.
Revenue provide <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/cat/leaflets/it39.html">A

<h2>Exemptions</h2>

<p>The following items are exempt from Capital Acquisitions Tax:</p>
<ul><li>Gifts or inheritances from a spouse or civil partner</li>
  <li>Payments for damages or compensation </li>
  <li>Benefits used only for the medical expenses of a person who is
    permanently incapacitated due to physical or mental illness </li>
  <li>Benefits taken for charitable purposes or received from a charity </li>
  <li>Winnings from a lottery, sweepstake, game, or betting </li>
  <li>Reasonable support for the maintenance or education of a child or
    spouse/civil partner. </li>
</ul><p>Houses, gardens or objects that are of national, scientific, historic or
artistic merit and meet certain conditions (see 'Heritage Property Relief'
below).</p>

<p>Pension and redundancy payments are not usually liable to Gift Tax. If the
employee however is a relative of the employer, or the employer is a private
company and the employee is deemed to control the company, Revenue may disallow
this exemption if they consider the payment excessive.</p>

<p>The first €3,000 of the total value of all gifts received from one person
in any calendar year is exempt. This does not apply to inheritances.</p>

<p>If a parent receives an inheritance (with full and complete ownership), from
a child, it is exempt from tax if the child had taken an inheritance or gift
from either parent in the previous five years <em>and</em> that inheritance or
gift was not exempt from Capital Acquisitions Tax.</p>

<p>Payments that reduce the debt of a bankrupt or near-bankrupt are usually
exempt (<a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0001/sec0082.html#partix-sec82">Section
82, Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003</a>).</p>

<p>Other exemptions relate to government securities or unit trusts where the
beneficiary is non-resident. </p>

<p>See Appendix 6 of <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/cat/leaflets/it39-2003-edition.pdf">Revenue
guide IT 39 (pdf)</a> for further information on the above reliefs and
exemptions.</p>

<h2>Dwelling-house exemption</h2>

<p>A gift <strong>or</strong> inheritance of a house which has been your main
residence may be exempt from Capital Acquisitions Tax if you do not own or have
an interest in any other house.</p>

<p>You must have lived in the house as your main residence for the three years
immediately preceding the date of the gift or inheritance. However, in the case
of <strong>gifts</strong> taken on or after 20 February 2007, time you lived in
the house will not be counted if it was also the disponer's only or main
residence, unless, the disponer was dependent on your care because of old age
or illness. Also the house must be owned by the disponer for three years if it
is a gift taken on or after 20 February 2007.</p>

<p>If the house replaced another house as your main residence in that time, you
can still claim the exemption provided that your main residence was in these
houses for a total period of three out of the four preceding years. However, in
the case of <strong>gifts</strong> taken on or after 20 February 2007, each
house must be owned by the disponer for the relevant part of the 3 year period
that it was occupied by you. </p>

<p>You must continue to occupy the house as your main residence for the
following six years but this condition does not apply if you are over 55 years
at the time of receiving the benefit. If you are away because of an obligation
to work abroad you can include this as time resident. </p>

<p>Where the house is replaced by another property as your main residence, the
time for which each house is your main residence must total six of the seven
years commencing on the date of the gift or inheritance. </p>

<p>If you sell the house and the sale does not meet the conditions outlined
above then the relief will be withdrawn. An exception to this is if the
property is sold because you need long-term care in a hospital or nursing
home.</p>

<p>If you sell the house within six years and the value of a replacement
property is less than the value of the original property then there will be a
clawback of the difference. For example, if the original relief was for a
property worth €600,000 and you sell this to buy a property worth €400,000,
you will only be allowed relief on the €400,000 and there will be a clawback
on the €200,000 difference. You will need to complete a revised form IT 38
and pay the additional tax within four months.</p>

<h2>Agricultural relief</h2>

<p>Gifts and inheritances of agricultural property can qualify for relief that
reduces the market value of the property by 90% for the purposes of Capital
Acquisitions Tax.</p>

<p>To qualify for Agricultural Relief the beneficiary must be a farmer. This
means that taking the gift or inheritance into account, agricultural property
must account for at least 80% of the gross market value of your assets on
valuation date. This restriction does not apply if the gift or inheritance is
trees or underwood.</p>

<p>If your principal residence is not situated on the farm it does not qualify
as agricultural property. However borrowings on such a residence can be offset
against its value. This may reduce the value of assets that are
non-agricultural, increasing the proportion of agricultural assets for the 80%
rule.</p>

<p>The relief will be withdrawn:</p>
<ul><li>If the beneficiary is not resident for all of the three tax years
    following the tax year in which the valuation date falls. </li>
  <li>If the property is sold within six years and not replaced by another
    agricultural property with one year </li>
  <li>If the property is compulsorily purchased within six years and not
    replaced within six years. </li>
</ul><p>If a beneficiary does not qualify for Agricultural Relief, then agricultural
property can qualify for Business Relief.</p>

<p>If Agricultural Relief or Business Relief has been granted on the
development value of development land, the relief will be clawed back if the
land is disposed of between six to ten years after the date of the gift or
inheritance. Development land is land with a value that exceeds the current use
value of the land at the date of the gift or inheritance.</p>

<p>In calculating the taxable value of the propery after agricultural relief,
only 10% of the value of the allowable deductions are taken into account (that
is, the deductions are reduced by 90%, in proportion with the relief). </p>

<p>For more information on Agricultural Relief is available in IT 39 (Appendix
2) or <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0001/sec0089.html#partx-chapi-sec89">Section
89 of Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003</a>.</p>

<h2>Business relief</h2>

<p>Gifts and inheritances of relevant business property qualify for relief that
reduces the taxable value of the property by 90% for the purposes of Capital
Acquisitions Tax.</p>

<h3>Relevant business property</h3>

<p>Relevant business property includes the following.</p>

<p>The business or, for a business carried on by a sole trader or by a
partnership, an interest in the business. A "Business" is defined as one which
is carried on for gain and it includes the exercise of a profession or vocation
as well as a trade. Individual assets used in the business, such as a factory
will not qualify for the relief if they are transferred to the beneficiary
without the business.</p>

<p>The unquoted shares or securities of a company carrying on a business
provided that the company is incorporated and that the shares meet certain
requirements specified in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0001/sec0093.html#partx-chapii-sec93">section
93 of Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003</a> and outlined in IT 39
(Appendix 3). </p>

<p>Any land or buildings, machinery or plant in the State that are owned by the
disponer but used wholly or mainly for the purpose of a business carried on by
a company controlled by the disponer or by a partnership of which the disponer
was a partner. The shares in the company or the partnership interest must be
taken by the beneficiary together with the lands, buildings, machinery or plant
in order for those assets to qualify for the relief.</p>

<p>Quoted shares or securities of a company if the shares were unquoted before
23 May 1994 or if later, were unquoted at the time the disponer became the
beneficial owner. Quoted shares or securites must meet the same requirement
specified for unquoted shares in order to qualify for relief.</p>

<h3>Exclusions</h3>

<p>Businesses are excluded from the relief if they wholly or mainly consist of
dealing in currencies, securities, stocks, shares, land or buildings, or making
or holding investments</p>

<h3>Conditions</h3>

<p>The relevant business property must have been in continuous ownership by the
disponer for a minimum period of two years in the case of an inheritance which
was taken on the death of the disponer or five years in any other case.</p>

<p>This period can include a period of ownership by the disponer's spouse or a
trustee. A replacement of a relevant business property can be included in the
ownership requirement, in which case the minimum periods are extended to three
and six years respectively. </p>

<p>In the case where a beneficiary receives a gift or inheritance that meets
the minimum period requirement but they then die before they in turn have owned
it for the minimum period, the subsequent inheritor of the benefit can still
qualify business relief under the minimun period condition.</p>

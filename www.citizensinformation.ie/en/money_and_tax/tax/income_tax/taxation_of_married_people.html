<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you get married, both you and your spouse continue to be treated as
single people for tax purposes in that year. If, however, the tax you pay as
two single people is greater than the tax that would be payable if you were
taxed as a married couple, you can claim the difference. (In other words, you
can claim a tax refund). Refunds are only due from the date of marriage and
will be calculated after the following 31 December. So, for example, if you get
married in 2017, any tax refund due to you will be calculated after 31 December
2017.</p>

<p>Refunds are normally only due where a couple are taxed at different rates
and one spouse could benefit from the unused standard rate cut-off point or for
some of the unused tax credits of the other spouse. </p>

<p>When you get married therefore, it is important to advise the tax office of
the date of your marriage. You will also need to quote your own and your
spouse's <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">Personal
Public Service Number (PPS number)</a>. </p>

<p>For the years following your marriage, there are three options for taxation.
All of the options and the outcomes of choosing them are outlined below. The
three options are: </p>
<ul><li>Assessment as a single person (i.e. you are both still taxed as single
    people) </li>
  <li>Separate assessment </li>
  <li>Joint assessment/aggregation. </li>
</ul><h3>Taxation of civil partners</h3>

<p>Following <a href="../../../birth_family_relationships/getting_married/getting_married.html">the
commencement of the Marriage Act 2015 on 16 November 2015</a>, civil
partnership is no longer available to new couples.</p>

<p>Couples who entered into a civil partnership before the enactment of the
Marriage Act 2015 can continue as civil partners. Their rights and obligations
are not affected by the Marriage Act 2015 and they can continue to be taxed in
the same way as married couples.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Assessment as a single person</h3>

<p>Under assessment as a single person, each spouse/civil partner is treated as
a single person for tax reasons. With this option:</p>
<ul><li>Both spouses/civil partners are taxed on their own income </li>
  <li>Both spouses/civil partners get tax credits and the same standard rate
    cut-off point due to a single person </li>
  <li>Both spouses/civil partners pay their own tax </li>
  <li>Both spouses/civil partners complete their own return of income form and
    claim their own tax credits. One spouse/civil partner cannot claim relief
    for payments made by the other. There is no right to transfer tax credits
    or standard rate cut-off point to each other. </li>
</ul><p>To claim assessment as a single person, you will have to contact your tax
office. Either spouse/civil partner can make the claim and the option remains
until the person who claims it changes his or her mind. If you wish to claim
assessment as a single person, you must apply within the tax year (preferably
at the start of the year). </p>

<p>Choosing to be assessed as a single person when you are married or in a
civil partnership is unfavourable in some circumstances. This is mainly because
you cannot transfer any unused tax credits or standard rate cut-off point. You
cannot claim <a shape="rect" href="credits_and_reliefs/home_carers_tax_credit.html">Home Carer's Tax
Credit</a> if your spouse/civil partner is caring for a dependent person and
would otherwise qualify for the relief.</p>

<h3>Separate assessment</h3>

<p>Under the separate assessment option, the tax affairs of spouses/civil
partners are independent of each other. The difference between separate
assessment and the previous option (assessment as a single person) is that
under this option, some tax credits are divided equally between you. These tax
credits are:</p>
<ul><li>Married or Civil Partner's Tax Credit </li>
  <li>Age Tax Credit </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/tax_reliefs_for_people_with_a_visual_impairment.html">Blind
    Person's Tax Credit</a> </li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="../tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/incapacitated_child_tax_credit.html">Incapacitated
    Child Tax Credit</a>. </li>
</ul><p>The balance of the tax credits is given to each of you in proportion to the
cost borne by you. The PAYE tax credit and expenses (if any), are allocated to
the appropriate spouse/civil partner. Any tax credits other than the PAYE tax
credit and employment expenses that are unused by one partner can be claimed by
the other spouse/civil partner. The tax credits are not usually adjusted until
after the end of the tax year.</p>

<p>Any tax credits that are unused (other than the PAYE tax credit and
employment expenses) and the standard rate cut-off point up to €42,800 in
2017 can be transferred to the other spouse/civil partner but only at the end
of the tax year. The increase in the standard rate tax band of up to €24,800
in 2017 is not transferable between partners. If you think you have unused tax
credits or standard rate cut-off point, contact your tax office for a review
after the end of the tax year. Overall, the amount of the tax that is payable
under this option (separate assessment) is the same that is payable under the
joint assessment option discussed below. </p>

<p>The claim for separate assessment must be between 1 October of the preceding
year and the 31 March in the year of the claim. Either spouse or civil partner
can request this form of assessment. To withdraw the option, you must contact
your tax office. Each spouse or civil partner can complete a separate return of
his or her own income. </p>

<h3>Joint assessment</h3>

<p>The joint assessment (or "<em>aggregation</em>") option is usually the most
favourable basis of assessment for a married couple or civil partners. This
option is automatically given by the tax office when you advise them of your
marriage or civil partnership but this does not prevent you from choosing any
of the options examined earlier. Under this option, the tax credits and
standard rate cut-off point can be allocated between spouses to suit their own
circumstances. </p>

<p>If only one spouse/civil partner has taxable income, all tax credits and the
standard rate cut-off point will be given to the spouse/civil partner with the
income. </p>

<p>If both of you have taxable income, you can decide which of you is to be the
assessable spouse/nominated civil partner. You then ask the tax office to
allocate the tax credits and standard rate cut-off point between you in
whatever way you wish. (The PAYE tax credit, employment expenses and the
increase in standard rate cut-off point of €24,800 in 2017 are not
transferable). </p>

<p>If your tax office does not get a request from you to allocate your tax
credits in any particular way; the tax office will normally give all the tax
credits (other than the other partner's PAYE and expense tax credits) to the
spouse/civil partner being assessed. The spouse/civil partner being assessed
must complete the return of income for the couple and is chargeable to tax on
the joint income of the couple. </p>

<p>If one spouse/civil partner is self-employed, joint assessment can still
apply. The flexibility this option brings can be very convenient - especially
if one of you pays tax under the PAYE system and the other pays tax under the
self-assessment system. Under joint assessment, you let your circumstances
determine if most of the tax should be paid under PAYE or in a lump sum on
assessment. This is determined by the way in which the tax credits are
allocated. If you choose to pay most of your tax under PAYE, the tax credits
(apart from the PAYE tax credit and employment expenses), should be offset
against the self-assessment income. </p>

<p>The choice about who becomes the assessable spouse or nominated civil
partner is made by both of you. All you need to do is to inform Revenue which
of you is to be the assessable spouse or nominated civil partner. If you have
not made your nomination, the spouse or civil partner with the higher income in
the latest year for which details of both spouses' incomes are known becomes
the assessable spouse or nominated civil partner. This person continues to be
the assessable spouse/nominated civil partner until both of you jointly elect
that the other spouse/civil partner is to be the assessable spouse/nominated
civil partner or until either of you opts for either separate assessment or
assessment as a single person. </p>

<h3>Repayments of tax</h3>

<p>Repayments that arise from an end of year review will in general be
apportioned and repaid on the basis of the tax paid by each spouse/civil
partner. </p>

<p>If both of you are in employment, then a Certificate of Tax Credits is
issued to each of you. All of the tax credits and reliefs due to a married
couple or civil partners where joint assessment applies are shown on the
assessable spouse/nominated civil partner's notice - the amount "allocated to
other employments" is also shown. This amount ("<em>allocated to other

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The standard rate cut-off point for married couples/civil partners is
€42,800 in 2017. This amount is taxed at 20% and the balance is taxed at 40%.
Where both spouses/civil partners have income, this standard rate cut-off point
can be increased by the <strong>lower</strong> of the following:</p>
<ul><li>€24,800 in 2017 <strong>or</strong> </li>
  <li>The amount of the income of the spouse/civil partner with the smaller
    income. </li>
</ul><p>The increase in the standard rate cut-off point interacts with the Home
Carer's Tax Credit. If the increased standard rate cut-off point is more
beneficial than the Home Carer's Tax Credit, you can claim the increase
instead. As a matter of course, the tax office will grant you whichever is more
beneficial to you. More information is available about the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it66.pdf">Home Carer's Tax
Credit (pdf)</a>. </p>

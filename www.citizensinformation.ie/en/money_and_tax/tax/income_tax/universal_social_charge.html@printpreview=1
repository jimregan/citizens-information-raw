<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Universal Social Charge (USC) is a tax on income that replaced both the
income levy and the health levy (also known as the health contribution) since 1
January 2011. </p>

<p>You pay the USC if your gross income is more than €13,000 per year. (This
limit was €4,004 in 2011, €10,036 from 2012 to 2014 and €12,012 in 2015).
Once your income is over this limit, you pay the relevant rate of USC on all of
your income. It is calculated on a weekly or monthly basis. </p>

<p>It does not apply to social welfare or similar payments, and there are
certain other exceptions: see 'Income exempt from the USC' below.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Budget 2016</h3>

<p>Incomes of €13,000 or less are exempt from USC in 2016. Once your income
is over this limit, you pay the relevant rate of USC on all of your income.
Note that the threshold for the lowest (1%) rate continues to be €12,012. If
you have income of €13,000 you pay no USC. If you have income of €13,001
you pay 1% on income up to €12,012 and 3% on income between €12,012 and
€13,001. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Income liable for the USC</h3>

<p>The Universal Social Charge is payable on gross income, including notional
pay (notional pay is the value of a non-cash benefit, such as benefit-in-kind),
after any relief for certain capital allowances. The Universal Social Charge is
payable on pension contributions.</p>

<p>You pay the Universal Social Charge if your gross income is more than
€13,000 per year. Once your income is over this limit, you pay the USC on all
of your income. For married couples or civil partners, each spouse or civil
partner is treated individually by their employer or pension provider
throughout the year.</p>

<p>Liability for the USC depends on the date of the payment rather than on when
the income was earned.</p>

<p>Although you may have no liability to income tax based on your entitlement
to tax credits or by use of losses or capital allowances you may still have a
liability to pay the Universal Social Charge on your income.</p>

<p>Some sources of income, for example, from occupation of certain woodlands,
profits from stallion fees, stud greyhound services fees and farmland leasing,
patent royalty income and <a href="artists_exemption_from_income_tax.html">earnings of certain writers,
artists and composers</a>, are exempt from income tax but are liable to the
Universal Social Charge.</p>

<h3>Income exempt from the USC</h3>

<p>You do not pay the Universal Social Charge if your total income for a year
is under €13,000. (If you are aged 70 or over or a medical card holder aged
under 70 and your aggregate income for the year is €60,000 or less you pay a
reduced rate of USC.)</p>

<p>All Department of Social Protection payments, including <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/maternity_benefit.html">Maternity
Benefit</a> and <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/older_and_retired_people/">State
pensions</a>, are exempt from the Universal Social Charge. Similar payments,
such as payments made as part of <a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/community_employment_scheme.html">Community
Employment schemes</a> or the <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/back_to_education/back_to_education_allowance.html">Back
to Education Allowance</a>, are exempt. Social welfare or similar payments made
from abroad are exempt. Student grants and scholarships are also exempt.</p>

<p>Income where <a href="../tax_on_savings_and_investments/deposit_interest_retention_tax.html">DIRT
(Deposit Interest Retention Tax)</a> has already been paid is exempt from the
USC.</p>

<p>There are a number of other exemptions. These include:</p>
<ul><li>Certain salary sacrifice schemes, such as the <a href="../../../travel_and_recreation/public_transport/public_transport_commuter_tickets_and_tax.html">TaxSaver
    Commuter Ticket Scheme</a> and the <a href="../income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/cycle_to_work_scheme.html">Cycle
    to Work scheme</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/redundancy_payments.html">Statutory
    redundancy payments</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../../birth_family_relationships/adoption_and_fostering/fostering.html">Foster
    care payments</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child
    Benefit</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../../housing/owning_a_home/home_owners/rent_a_room_scheme.html">Rent
    a Room Relief</a></li>
</ul><p>There is a full list of exceptions in <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/usc/universal-social-charge-faqs.pdf">Revenue's
Frequently Asked Questions document (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h3>Redundancy payments</h3>

<p><a href="../../../employment/unemployment_and_redundancy/redundancy/redundancy_payments.html">Statutory
redundancy payments</a> are exempt from the charge. Statutory redundancy
payments amount to 2 weeks’ pay per year of service plus a bonus week subject
to a maximum payment of €600 per week. In addition, redundancy payments above
the statutory redundancy amount are exempt from the Universal Social Charge, up
to certain limits. These limits are up to €10,160 plus €765 per complete
year of service in excess of the statutory redundancy. This basic exemption can
be further increased by up to €10,000 if the person is not a member of an
occupational pension scheme.</p>

<p>The Universal Social Charge is charged on liable income after the statutory
exemptions above, and after any additional deduction for <a href="../../../employment/retirement/income_tax_in_retirement/retirement_lump_sum_taxation.html">Standard
Capital Superannuation Benefit (SCSB)</a>.</p>

<h3>Maintenance payments</h3>

<p>How <a href="../../../birth_family_relationships/separation_and_divorce/maintenance_orders_and_agreements.html">maintenance
payments</a> are treated for Universal Social Charge purposes depends on
whether they are voluntary payments or legally enforceable payments.</p>

<p>Voluntary maintenance payments (payments paid under an informal
arrangement):</p>
<ul><li>The spouse making the payments does not receive exemption from the
    Universal Social Charge on the portion of their income which they pay as
    maintenance.</li>
  <li>The spouse who receives the payments is not subject to the Universal
    Social Charge on the maintenance payments they receive.</li>
</ul><p>Legally enforceable maintenance payments (payable under legal
obligation):</p>
<ul><li>The spouse making the payments is entitled to receive an exemption from
    the Universal Social Charge on the portion of their income on the
    maintenance they pay either directly or indirectly to their spouse. There
    is no exemption for any portion of the maintenance payments paid towards
    the maintenance of children.</li>
  <li>An employee wishing to claim Universal Social Charge exemption in respect
    of legally enforceable maintenance payments throughout the year may either
    give the information required to their payroll office, or alternatively
    they can apply to Revenue at the end of the year to claim any refund of
    Universal Social Charge due.</li>
  <li>The spouse who receives the payments is subject to the Universal Social
    Charge on the portion of the maintenance payments they receive in respect
    of themselves. Any portion of the maintenance payments paid towards the
    maintenance of children is not subject to the Universal Social Charge.</li>
</ul><p>In the case of a legally enforceable maintenance arrangement, where a
separated couple has jointly elected to be treated as a married couple for
income tax purposes, the spouse making the payments does not receive exemption
from the Universal Social Charge on the portion of their income which they pay
as maintenance. The spouse who receives the payments is not subject to the
Universal Social Charge on the maintenance payments they receive.</p>

<h3>Pension contributions</h3>

<p>An employer’s or pension provider’s contribution to an approved
retirement benefit scheme is not liable to the Universal Social Charge, but an
employee's contributions are. From 1 January 2016, employer contributions to
your <a href="../../personal_finance/pensions/personal_retirement_savings_accounts.html">Personal
Retirement Savings Account (PRSA)</a> are no longer subject to USC. Up to 31
December 2015, these contributions were subject to USC.</p>

<h3>Pensions</h3>

<p>Occupational pensions are subject to the Universal Social Charge, but
Department of Social Protection pensions or similar pensions from abroad are
not. The USC is only payable on lump sum pension payments on the portion over
€500,000.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>If your income is less than €13,000 you pay no Universal Social Charge
(USC). (This limit was €4,004 in 2011, €10,036 from 2012 to 2014 and
€12,012 in 2015.) Once your income is over this limit, you pay the relevant
rate of USC on <em>all</em> of your income. For example, if you have income of
€13,000 you will pay no USC. If you have income of €13,001 you will pay 1%
on income up to €12,012 and 3% on income between €12,012 and €13,001. </p>

<p>Reduced rates of USC apply to:</p>
<ul><li>People aged 70 or over whose aggregate income for the year is €60,000
    or less</li>
  <li>Medical card holders aged under 70 whose aggregate income for the year is
    €60,000 or less</li>
</ul><p><em>Aggregate</em> income for USC purposes does not include payments from
the Department of Social Protection.</p>

<p>You must hold a full medical card (including a Health Amendment Act Card) to
qualify for the reduced rate. People who hold a GP visit card, a Drugs Payment
Scheme Card, a European Health Insurance Card or a Long-term Illness Scheme
Card do not qualify for the reduced rate. If a person reaches 70 years at any
stage during the year they will benefit from the maximum 3% rate for the whole
year. </p>

<p>People who hold Northern Ireland medical cards will no longer be treated as
holding a full medical card and will therefore not qualify for a reduced
rate.</p>

<h4>Self-employed income over €100,000</h4>

<p>A surcharge of 3% applies people who have income from self-employment above
€100,000, regardless of age.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Bonuses paid to employees of the 5 financial
institutions that have received financial support from the State are chargeable
to the USC at the rate of 45% on the full amount if the bonus is more than
€20,000 in a single tax year.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>An person who is earning €50,000 per year will pay the Universal Social
Charge at a rate of 1% on the first €12,012 (which comes to €120.12), 3% on
the next €6,656 (which comes to €199.68) and 5.5% on the balance of
€31,332 (which comes to €1,723.26). This person will pay €2,043.06 in
2016. </p>

<p>You do not pay the Universal Social Charge if your total income for a year
does not exceed €13,000. For example, a person who is earning €13,000 per
year will not pay any Universal Social Charge, while a person who is earning
€13,100 per year will pay 1% on €12,012 (which comes to €120.12) and 3%
on the remaining €1,088 which comes to €32.64). This person will pay a
total of €152.76 in the year.</p>

<p>A person who has self-employed income of €112,000 per year, will pay the
Universal Social Charge at a rate of 1% on the first €12,012 (which comes to
€120.12), 3% on the next €6,656 (which comes to €199.68) 5.5% on the next
€51,376 (which comes to €2,825.68), 8% on the next €29,956 (which comes
to €2,396.48) and 11% on the next €12,000 (which comes to €1,320). In
total this person will pay €6,861.96 in the year.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l47180">Administration of the Universal Social
Charge</h2>

<h3>Employees</h3>

<p>Universal Social Charge is deducted on a cumulative basis - similar to the
way in which PAYE is deducted. Employers and pension providers are responsible
for deducting the Universal Social Charge from their employees’ salaries.
They deduct and pay it to Revenue on behalf of employees. </p>

<p>Employer Tax Credit Certificates (P2Cs), as well as displaying PAYE rates
and cut-off points, also show USC rates and cut-off points. You should inform
Revenue of any changes in your circumstances (for example, if you get a medical
card) so your Tax Credit Certificate can be amended. </p>

<p>Details of the Universal Social Charge should be recorded separately on your
payslip. The total amount of USC paid should be shown on your P60 each year.
</p>

<p>If you change jobs your employer will give you a form P45. This will show
your pay, tax, USC, and PRSI details for the year up to the date you leave. You
should give this P45 to your new employer so that the correct amount of tax and
USC is deducted from your pay.</p>

<h3>Self-employed people</h3>

<p>Self-employed people make a payment of USC along with their preliminary tax
payment, and any balance will be collected when the final assessment issues.</p>

<h3>Refunds of overpayments</h3>

<p>For PAYE taxpayers, USC is deducted on a cumulative basis, similar to the
way PAYE is deducted. This means that your USC deductions are spread out evenly
over the year and the correct amount of USC is deducted at the end of the year.
Overpayments of USC should not arise. If, however, at the end of the year you
think you have overpaid USC, you can review your USC and tax on PAYE Anytime.
This service is now available through <a href="https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html">Revenue's myAccount
Service</a>. You can also contact <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/contact/index.html">your local Revenue
office</a> for a review of your USC deductions. </p>

<p>If you have become unemployed during the year you can <a href="tax_refund_when_unemployed_or_out_of_work_sick.html">reclaim any
overpayments of income tax and USC</a> using <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/forms/p50.pdf">Revenue's tax repayment
Form P50 (pdf)</a>. </p>

<p>The tax provisions that apply to married couples are available to civil
partners. Since 16 November 2015, no new civil partnerships can be registered
unless the couple have notified the registrar of their intention to enter a
civil partnership before that date. More information is available in our
document: <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/civil_partnerships/civil_partnership_and_same_sex_couples.html">Civil
partnership and same-sex couples</a>.</p>

<p>Civil partners are entitled to the same rights as married couples in
financial matters such as inheritance, property, pensions and maintenance if
the relationship breaks down. Your civil partnership does not have to be
registered in Ireland. Some legal relationships between same sex couples that
are recognised by a foreign state (such as marriage, civil union, civil
partnership) are recognised by the Minister for Justice and Equality. Any <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/SI-649-of-201">partnerships on the
Minister’s list</a> are recognised by Revenue for taxation purposes.</p>

<p>You can find out more about how people in a civil partnership are taxed in
our document <a href="../housing_taxes_and_reliefs/tax/income_tax/taxation_of_married_people.html">Taxation
of married people and civil partners</a>. If your <a href="../birth_family_relationships/separation_and_divorce/legal_options_following_civil_partnership_breakdown.html">civil
partnership breaks down and is dissolved</a>, protection orders, maintenance
orders and pension adjustment orders may be made in the course of court
proceedings for the dissolution of civil partnerships in the same way as such
orders may be made in judicial separation and divorce proceedings. Currently
only payments made under maintenance agreements ordered by a Court are
allowable as a deduction against your income tax liability. Maintenance
payments made to children are not deductable.</p>

<h3>Cohabitants and tax</h3>

<p>The Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act
2010 gives protection to a financially dependent person at the end of a <a href="../birth_family_relationships/cohabiting_couples/property_rights_and_unmarried_couples.html">long-term
cohabiting relationship</a>. It also gives a cohabiting partner rights over a
deceased person’s estate. <strong>However the Act does not give any
cohabiting couples the same tax treatment as married couples or civil
partners.</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>only income tax provision </strong><strong>for cohabiting
couples</strong> is tax relief for court-ordered maintenance payments made to a
financially dependant former cohabitant on the ending of a long-term cohabiting
relationship. It is important to note that to qualify for tax relief the
maintenance order must have been determined by the court rather than being an
informal arrangement between the former cohabitants.</p>

<p>In addition if a former cohabitant is granted redress by the courts through
the transfer of an asset, this transaction is not liable to stamp duty or
capital acquisitions tax and the donor of the property does not have a capital
gains tax liability. Previously the former cohabiting couple would have been
deemed unconnected and subject to full acquisitions tax, stamp duty and capital
gains tax.</p>

FAQ document</a>.</p>

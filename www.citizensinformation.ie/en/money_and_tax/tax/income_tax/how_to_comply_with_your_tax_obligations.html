<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Whether you are employed as a PAYE worker or pay <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/taxation_of_self_employed_people.html">tax
as a self-employed person</a> you must make sure that you pay any tax that is
due to Revenue. This document focuses on information for PAYE workers or
pensioners who have another source of income. </p>

<p>If you work for an employer and pay tax under the PAYE system income earned
from employment is taxed at source by your employer. However the amount
deducted can vary depending on your personal circumstances and your tax
credits. For example, if you are <a href="taxation_of_married_people.html">married or in a civil partnership</a>,
this may affect your tax bands and tax reliefs. </p>

<p>People who work for an employer may also have additional income from other
sources. You must tell Revenue about such income. However, depending on the
amount, you declare the income in different ways. In some cases income from
other sources (such as a social welfare payment) can be <em>coded in</em>
against your tax credits and cut off point. Coding in means that Revenue will
reduce both your tax credits and your standard rate cut-off point, by an amount
equal to your other income. Your other income is then effectively taxed under
PAYE.</p>

<h2>Compliance Code for PAYE tax payers</h2>

<p>You should make sure that Revenue is aware of the factors that may affect
the amount of tax deducted from your earnings. Do not assume that Revenue has
access to up-to-date information about your circumstances. Revenue’s <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/personal/compliance-code-for-paye-taxpayers.pdf">Compliance
Code for PAYE Tax Payers (pdf)</a> advises you to:</p>
<ul><li>Check your Tax Credit Certificate each year and make sure that you are
    entitled to the tax credits that have been allocated to you and that you
    are claiming any tax credits you may be entitled to. You can use
    Revenue’s PAYE Anytime online system to view or print your Tax Credit
    Certificate or phone Locall 1890 306 706 to request one.</li>
  <li>Tell Revenue about any changes in basic personal details such as a change
    of address as well as changes in your circumstances that may affect your
    entitlement to a tax credit(s). In particular you should tell Revenue about
    significant life events such as marriage or civil partnership or
    bereavement as soon as possible.</li>
  <li>Keep all relevant documentation (such as medical receipts) to support
    your claims for tax credits, reliefs and allowances. You must keep all
    supporting documentation for 6 years from the end of the year to which the
    claim or liability refers.</li>
  <li>Inform Revenue of any non-PAYE sources of income you have such as rental
    income, dividends, Department of Social Protection payments and pensions.
    Any additional non-PAYE income may be subject to tax, <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">PRSI</a>
    or <a href="universal_social_charge.html">Universal Social Charge
    (USC)</a> and it is important that you pay any tax that is due to avoid
    building up a tax liability.</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l88efd">Self-assessment </h2>

<p>If you are a <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/practitioner/tax-briefing/archive/62/tb05.htm">chargeable
person</a> you must <em></em><em>self-assess</em>. Self-assessment is where you
are responsible for making your own assessment of tax due. </p>

<h3>Who is a chargeable person?</h3>

<p>You are a chargeable person if you have a PAYE source of income and,
either:</p>
<ul><li>Net assessable non-PAYE income (including income subject to DIRT) of
    €5,000 or more in a year 
    <p><em>or</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>Total gross income from non-PAYE sources (including income subject to
    DIRT), of €30,000 or more in a year. This applies even if you have no tax
    liability on this income because it is covered or largely covered by
    losses, capital allowances and other reliefs.</li>
</ul><p>If you are a chargeable person you must self-assess and file a Form 11 for
the relevant year. From 2014 <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Information-on-the-Extension-of-PRSI-Liability-to-Unearned-Income.aspx">if
you are a chargeable person you must also pay PRSI at Class K</a> on your
assessable income.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Who is not a chargeable person?</h3>

<p>If you have a PAYE source of income and your net assessable non-PAYE income
is less than €5,000, and this income is coded against PAYE tax credits or
fully taxed at source, you are not regarded as a chargeable person (provided
your gross non-PAYE income before expenses does not exceed €30,000).</p>

<p>However you must inform Revenue of this income. You can do this using PAYE
Anytime, by contacting your local Revenue office or by filing a Form 12. You do
not have to pay PRSI on this income. Form 12 allows you to complete a return of
your income and claim tax credits, allowances and reliefs (including any health
expenses) for a year. You do not have to file a Form 12 unless Revenue have
asked you to do so. </p>

<p>If you have a State pension and another pension or form of income which
brings your income over the exemption limit for people aged over 65 you must
file a Form 12 if you are not already being taxed on this income. The limits
are currently €18,000 for a single person and €36,000 for a married couple
or civil partners. </p>

<p></p>

<h3>Pay and File system</h3>

<p>Under self-assessment there is a common date for the payment of tax and
filing of tax returns. This is 31 October each year. This system, which is
known as <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/self-assessment.html">Pay
and File</a> allows you (or an agent) to file your return and pay the balance
of tax outstanding for the previous year at the same time. Under this system
you must:</p>
<ul><li>Pay preliminary tax for the current tax year on or before 31 October each
    year – this may be extended for people who use Revenue’s Online Service
    (ROS).</li>
  <li>Make your tax return after the end of the tax year but not later than the
    following 31 October.</li>
  <li>Pay any balance of tax due for the previous tax year on or before 31
    October.</li>
  <li>Pay any Capital Gains Tax on disposals made between 1 January and 30
    September of the current tax year.</li>
</ul><p></p>

<h3>Full-self assessment</h3>

<p>Note that the rules about self-assessment changed for the year 2013. In
previous years Revenue would assess your liability for tax on the basis of the
information you entered in your income tax return. </p>

<p>From 2013, your annual return of income form – Form 11 - includes a
self-assessment section which you (or your agent) must complete and sign. If
you do not make this self-assessment you will be liable to a penalty of €250.
However, you do not have to make a self-assessment if you returned the
completed Form 11 on or before 31 August in the year following the year of
assessment If you filed your completed return on or before that date Revenue
will make the self-assessment on your behalf. If you use ROS, the system can
calculate your tax liability based on the information you input and you can
then choose to use this in your self-assessment.</p>

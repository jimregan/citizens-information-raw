<p>The main legal obligation when becoming self-employed is that you must
register as a self-employed person with Revenue. You pay tax on the profits
from your business and on any other income that you have.</p>

<p>If you make a late payment of any taxes due by you, you will be charged
interest from the due date to the date when your payment is received.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>As a self-employed person you pay income tax under <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/self-assessment.html">the
self-assessment system</a>, once a year. Self-assessment means that you are
responsible for making your own assessment of tax due. </p>

<p>You pay Preliminary Tax (an estimate of tax due for your current trading
year) on or before 31 October each year and make a tax return for the previous
year not later than 31 October.</p>

<p>For example, if your accounting year is from 1 January to 31 December each
year, you pay Preliminary Tax for 2017 by <strong>31 October 2017</strong>,
based on an estimate of your liability for the full year. At the same time you
make a tax return for 2016 and pay any taxes outstanding for that year. If you
file your tax return online using the <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/ros/index.html">Revenue Online Service
(ROS)</a>, you may be able to file your return slightly later. You are entitled
to the normal income tax credits and reliefs. For 2017, you may claim an <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/about/foi/s16/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-44.pdf">Earned
Income tax credit of €950</a> (pdf) (increased from €550 in 2016). However,
if you also qualify for the PAYE tax credit, the combined value of these 2 tax
credits cannot exceed €1,650. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>You must keep proper records which include:</p>
<ul><li>All purchases and sales of goods and services and</li>
  <li>All amounts received and all amounts paid out</li>
</ul><p>You must keep supporting records (for example, invoices, bank and building
society statements, cheque stubs and receipts). You do not have to send them in
to Revenue, but you must keep them in case of a Revenue audit, that is, an
inspection.</p>

<p>You can claim certain business expenses against tax, such as purchase of
goods for re-sale, wages, rent, rates, repairs, lighting and heating, running
costs of vehicles or machinery used in the business, accountancy fees, interest
paid on business loans, leasing payments on vehicles or machinery used in the
business. as well as contributions to your personal pension (up to certain
limits).</p>

<p>If you are working from home you may be able to claim a proportion of
household bills such as telephone, heating, lighting etc.</p>

<p>You can find more information on self-employment in <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it10.html">Revenue’s A Guide
to Self Assessment IT10</a>, which includes information how to fill in your tax
return and important deadlines. <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/running/registering-tax.html">Revenue
also has information on registering for tax</a> and about the business expenses
that you can claim against income. Your local Revenue office can also help you
with any questions that you may have.</p>

<p><strong>Subcontractors:</strong> If you are a self-employed subcontractor
working in construction, forestry or meat processing there is <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/rct/index.html">detailed information about
Relevant Contracts Tax</a> on Revenue's website.</p>

<h3>Universal Social Charge, PRSI and VAT</h3>

<p><strong>USC:</strong> Everyone is liable to pay the <a href="universal_social_charge.html">Universal Social Charge (USC)</a> if
their gross income is over €13,000 in a year.</p>

<p>An extra charge of 3% applies to any self-employed income over €100,000
regardless of age. This means that self-employed people pay a total of 11% USC
on any income over €100,000. The USC does not apply to social welfare or
similar payments. You pay your USC with your preliminary tax payment.</p>

<p><strong>PRSI:</strong> Self-employed people pay <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/class_S_prsi.html">Class
S PRSI</a> on their income. </p>

<h4>Value Added Tax (VAT) </h4>

<p>You must <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vat/guide/registration.html">register for
Value Added Tax (VAT)</a> if your annual turnover is more than or is likely to
be more than €75,000 for supply of goods or €37,500 for supply of service.
As a trader you pay <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vat/guide/general.html">VAT on goods and
services</a> acquired for the business and charge VAT on goods and services
supplied by the business. The difference between the VAT charged by you and the
VAT you were charged must be paid to the Revenue. If the amount of VAT paid by
you exceeds the VAT charged by you, Revenue will repay the excess. This ensures
that VAT is paid by the ultimate customer and not by the business.</p>

<p>If you are registered for VAT Revenue will send you a form VAT3 which must
be returned with the payment not later than a specified date. Normally, VAT
returns are made every 2 months, but there are special arrangements for small
businesses who can pay at less frequent intervals.</p>

<h3>Form 11</h3>

<p>If you are self-employed you (or an agent) must make your income tax return
and self-assess your tax liability. You have the following options:</p>
<ul><li>You can fill out a paper Form 11 and send to Revenue</li>
  <li>You can use a shorter Form 11E which is an extract of the main personal
    Tax Return form</li>
  <li>You can also file your Form 11 using Revenue’s Online System (ROS). <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/ros/mandatory-e-filing.html">Certain
    people <strong>must</strong> e-file using ROS.</a></li>
</ul><p>You can access the <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/popular-forms.html">forms on the
Revenue website</a>. Revenue also provide <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/guide-pay-file.pdf">A Guide to
Completing Pay and File Tax Returns (pdf)</a></p>

<p></p>

<h3>Full-self assessment</h3>

<p>Note that the rules about self-assessment changed for the year 2013. In
previous years Revenue would assess your liability for tax on the basis of the
information you entered in your income tax return.</p>

<p>From 2013, your annual return of income form – Form 11 - includes a
self-assessment section which you (or your agent) must complete and sign. If
you do not make this self-assessment you will be liable to a penalty of €250.
However, you do not have to make a self-assessment if you returned the
completed Form 11 on or before 31 August in the year following the year of
assessment If you filed your completed return on or before that date Revenue
will make the self-assessment on your behalf. If you use ROS, the system can
calculate your tax liability based on the information you input and you can
then choose to use this in your self-assessment.</p>

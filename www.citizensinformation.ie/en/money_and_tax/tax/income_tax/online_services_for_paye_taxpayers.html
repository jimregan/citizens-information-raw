<p>If you are a PAYE taxpayer, that is if you have tax deducted from your
income by your employer, you can use the PAYE Anytime service and the Jobs and
Pensions service from Revenue. </p>

<p>This service is now available through <a href="https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html">Revenue's myAccount
Service</a>. These services are now available through Revenue's myAccount
Service which is a single access point for secure online services (excluding
ROS). Revenue’s myAccount Service is for people who are not registered for
ROS.</p>

<p>You can change your contact details, including your address, using
myAccount.</p>

<p>If you are a PAYE taxpayer who is not registered for ROS, you can use the <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/paye-anytime.html">PAYE Anytime
service</a>. Once you have registered, you can:</p>

<p></p><ul><li>View your tax record</li>
  <li>Claim a wide range of <a href="credits_and_reliefs/">tax credits</a></li>
  <li>Apply for refunds of tax including health expenses</li>
  <li>Declare additional income</li>
  <li>Request a review of tax liability for previous years</li>
  <li>Re-allocate credits between <a href="taxation_of_married_people.html">yourself and your spouse or civil
    partner</a></li>
  <li>Track correspondence submitted to Revenue</li>
</ul><p>PAYE Anytime is available to customers who merely want access to their tax
details. You do not have to submit transactions electronically if you do not
wish to. </p>

<p>You do not have to submit paper claims when you submit a transaction through
PAYE Anytime. However you are obliged to retain receipts for 6 years as Revenue
may ask to view them at a later stage.</p>

<p>When a transaction is submitted using PAYE Anytime, it will be immediately
acknowledged and a permanent record of the transaction will be put in Your
Requests History. </p>

<p>PAYE Anytime is available for the current and previous 4 years.</p>

<p>If you are <a href="../../../employment/starting_work_and_changing_job/starting_work/tax_and_starting_work.html">starting
work</a>, the <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/jobs-pensions.html">Jobs
and Pensions online service</a> allows you to register your new job with
Revenue. It is also available in ROS. It is for people who are:</p>
<ul><li>Starting their first job in the current tax year (including their first
    ever job in Ireland</li>
  <li>Changing job and their previous job is no longer on Revenue records </li>
  <li>Starting another in addition to their main job</li>
  <li>Starting to receive payments from a private pension (that is, not a
    Department of Social Protection pension)</li>
</ul><p>When you have registered the details of your new job or private pension,
Revenue will send your employer a tax credit certificate showing the tax
credits that your employer deducts from your tax bill. </p>

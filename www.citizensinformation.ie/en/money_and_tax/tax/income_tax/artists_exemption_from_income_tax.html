<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Income earned by writers, composers, visual artists and sculptors from the
sale of their works is exempt from tax in Ireland in certain circumstances. </p>

<p><a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0039/sec0195.html#zza39y1997s195">Section
195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997</a> allows the Revenue Commissioners
to determine that certain artistic works are original and creative works
generally recognised as having cultural or artistic merit. Earnings derived
from these works are exempt from income tax from the year in which the claim is
made. </p>

<p>Guidelines have been drawn up by for determining whether a work is an
<em>original and creative</em> work and whether it has or is generally
recognised as having <em>cultural or artistic merit</em>. </p>

<p>The Revenue Commissioners can make determinations in respect of artistic
works in the following categories: </p>
<ul><li>Books or other forms of writing </li>
  <li>Plays </li>
  <li>Musical compositions </li>
  <li>Paintings or other similar pictures </li>
  <li>Sculptures</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>People who are claiming an Artist's Exemption must be resident, or
ordinarily resident and domiciled, in an EU member State or in an EEA State and
not resident elsewhere. However, the Revenue Commissioners are prepared to give
advance opinions regarding the exemption to claimants who are resident outside
the EU or EEA. If these claimants receive a favourable advance opinion, they
are given a formal determination in respect of Artist's Exemption once they
take up residence in the EU or EEA.</p>

<p>Section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides that a work for
the purpose of the Section is an original and creative work if it is in one of
the following categories: </p>
<ul><li>Books or other forms of writing </li>
  <li>Plays </li>
  <li>Musical compositions </li>
  <li>Paintings or other similar pictures </li>
  <li>Sculptures. </li>
</ul><p>In broad terms, therefore, to be exempt under Section 195, your work has to
be both original and creative and to have either cultural merit or artistic
merit. It is not necessary for your work to have both cultural and artistic
merit - the presence of either quality is sufficient. </p>

<h3>Cultural or artistic merit</h3>

<p>A work has cultural merit if:</p>
<ul><li>Its contemplation enhances the quality of individual or social life as a
    result of its intellectual, spiritual or aesthetic form and content. </li>
</ul><p>A work has artistic merit when:</p>
<ul><li>Its combined form and content enhances or intensifies the aesthetic
    apprehension of those who experience or contemplate it. </li>
</ul><h3>Original and creative work</h3>

<p>For the purpose of a determination under Section 195 of the Taxes
Consolidation Act, 1997, the term <em>original and creative</em> encompasses
any unique work that is brought into existence for the first time as an
independent entity by the use of its creator's imagination. </p>

<p>A non-fiction book or other piece of writing will be considered original and
creative only if: </p>
<ul><li>It is an example of one of the following categories of literature (and
    any combination thereof) coming fully within the terms of the reference of
    the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.artscouncil.ie/">Arts Council</a>
    encompassing the subjects of fiction writing, drama, music, film, dance,
    mime or visual arts and any related commentaries by bona fide artists: </li>
  <li>Arts criticism </li>
  <li>Arts history </li>
  <li>Arts subject works </li>
  <li>Arts diaries </li>
  <li>Autobiography </li>
  <li>Belles-lettres essays </li>
  <li>Biography </li>
  <li>Cultural dictionaries </li>
  <li>Literary translation </li>
  <li>Literary criticism </li>
  <li>Literary history </li>
  <li>Literary diaries </li>
</ul><p><span>And</span></p>
<ul><li>The essence of the work is the presentation of the author's own ideas or
    insights in relation to the subject matter and these ideas or insights are
    so significant that the work would be regarded as a pioneering work casting
    new light on its subject matter or changing the generally accepted
    understanding of the subject matter. </li>
</ul><p><span>Or</span></p>
<ul><li>The publication comes fully within the terms of reference of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.heritagecouncil.ie">Heritage Council</a>,
    including work that, in its entirety, is a work of archaeology or a
    publication associated with items or areas of significant heritage value
  </li>
</ul><p><span>Or</span></p>
<ul><li>The work is a publication that comes fully within the terms of reference
    of the National Archives Advisory Council and is a work that relates to
    archives concerning Ireland that are more than 30 years old and are based
    largely on research from such archives. </li>
</ul><h3>Works that are not considered to be original and creative</h3>

<p>The following types of work will <strong>not</strong> be regarded as
<em>original and creative</em>: </p>
<ul><li>A book or other piece of writing that is published primarily for or that
    is or will be used primarily by students pursuing a course of study or
    people engaged in any trade, profession, vocation or branch of learning as
    an aid to professional or other practice in connection with the trade,
    profession, vocation or branch of learning. </li>
  <li>An article or series of articles published in a newspaper, magazine, book
    or elsewhere - except a book that consists of a series of articles by the
    same author connected by a common theme and that is therefore capable of
    existing independently in its own right. </li>
  <li>Types or kinds of plays that are written for advertising purposes and do
    not exist independently in their own right by reason of quality or
    duration. </li>
  <li>Types or kinds of musical compositions that are written for advertising
    purposes and do not exist independently in their own right by reason of
    quality or duration. </li>
  <li>Adaptations, arrangements, and versions of musical compositions by a
    person other than a bona fide composer who is also actively engaged in
    musical composition. </li>
  <li>Types or kinds of photographs or drawings (other than a set or sets of
    photographs or drawings that are collectively created for an artistic
    purpose) that are mainly of record, that serve a utilitarian function or
    that would not exist independently in their own right by reason of quality
    or by reference to their potential for inclusion as part of an art
    exhibition. </li>
  <li>Types or kinds of objects that are primarily functional in nature,
    objects produced by processes other than by hand or objects produced by
    hand by people other than those actively engaged as bona fide artists in
    the field of visual arts. </li>
</ul><h3>Payments to artists that are exempt from tax</h3>

<p>The following payments are exempt from tax from when they are made to an
artist who has received an Artist's Exemption: </p>
<ul><li>Arts Council bursaries </li>
  <li>Residencies when paid directly to the individual by the Arts Council for
    the purpose of producing a qualifying work </li>
  <li>Cnuas payments made under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.artscouncil.ie/en/homepage.aspx">Aosdana Scheme</a> </li>
  <li>Payments from the sale of works that are considered eligible under the
    Artists Exemption scheme </li>
  <li>Advance royalties. </li>
</ul><h3>Advance royalties </h3>

<p>Where an artist receives advance royalties that are attributable to the
subsequent publication of a book or other piece of writing, he or she must
lodge a claim with the Revenue Commissioners in the tax year in which the
royalties are paid if the royalties are to be exempt from tax. The artist must
provide confirmation from the publisher that the book will be published with
his or her claim. A draft copy of the work must also be submitted. </p>

<p>Where a claim is received in the tax year in which the advance is received
but a determination has not been granted, any tax liability arising on the
advance must be paid. If a determination is subsequently granted, the Inspector
of Taxes will review the artist's liability and make any appropriate refund if
tax has been overpaid. </p>

<p>Advance royalties that paid before the year of claim are <span>not</span>
exempt from tax. </p>

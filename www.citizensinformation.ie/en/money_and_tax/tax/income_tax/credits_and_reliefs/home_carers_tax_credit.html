<p>A Home Carer’s Tax Credit is a tax credit given to married couples or
civil partners (who are jointly assessed for tax) where one spouse or civil
partner works in the home caring for a dependent person.</p>

<p>The tax you are liable to pay is calculated as a percentage of your income.
A tax credit is deducted from this to give the actual amount of tax that you
have to pay. A tax credit has the effect of reducing your payable tax by the
amount of the credit.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>A Home Carer’s Tax Credit can be claimed when:</p>
<ul><li>The married couple or civil partners are jointly assessed for tax </li>
  <li>One spouse or civil partner works in the home caring for one or more
    dependent people </li>
  <li>The home carer’s own income is under €7,200. A reduced tax credit
    applies if the carer's income is between €7,200 and €9,400.</li>
</ul><p><a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/carers/carers_allowance.html">Carer’s
Allowance</a> or <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/carers/carers_benefit.html">Carer's
Benefit</a> are <strong>not</strong> taken into account when determining the
home carer’s income but they are taxable sources of income. This means that
if you are claiming Carer's Allowance or Carer's Benefit, it will make up part
of your jointly assessed income.</p>

<h3>Who is a dependent person?</h3>

<p>A dependent person is a:</p>
<ul><li>Child for whom <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child
    Benefit</a> is payable </li>
  <li>Person aged 65 or over </li>
  <li>Person with a disability who requires care</li>
</ul><p>A dependent person you are caring for <strong>cannot be a spouse or civil
partner.</strong> They can however, be a relative by marriage, or someone for
whom you act as a legal guardian.</p>

<h3>Does a relative have to live with us to be a dependent person?</h3>

<p>The dependent person normally has to live with you and your spouse or civil
partner in the tax year in order to quality for Home Carer's Tax Credit. </p>

<p><strong>A dependent person who is a relative can be cared for outside your
home.</strong> However, if the person is not living with you they must live
next door in a neighbouring residence, or on the same property, or within 2 km
of your home. In addition, there must be a direct communication link between
you (for example, a telephone line or alarm system). </p>

<p>The Home Carer’s Tax Credit for 2017 is €1,100.</p>

<p>If the home carer earns income of up to €7,200 in their own right for the
tax year, the full tax credit may be claimed.</p>

<p><strong>Reduced tax credit</strong> </p>

<p>However, if the income exceeds €7,200, the difference between the actual
income and €7,200 is calculated and then halved. The Home Carer's Tax Credit
is then reduced by that amount. The following table gives examples of how the
tax credit is calculated for different levels of income. </p>

<p>If the home carer's income is €9,400 or more during 2017 then you cannot
claim the tax credit.</p>

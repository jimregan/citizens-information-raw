<p>You can get a refund of tax you have already paid if you were employed and
find yourself unemployed. You may also get a tax refund if you are out of work
due to illness. You can also get tax back if you are still employed but have
paid more tax than you were liable for.</p>

<p>Another way to get tax back is through tax relief on services or products
that you have bought. Some of the cost of certain services and products can be
recouped from the tax you have already paid to Revenue, for example, <a shape="rect" href="../tax_credits_and_reliefs_for_people_with_disabilities/tax_relief_for_employing_a_home_carer.html">tax
relief for employing a carer</a> and <a shape="rect" href="../../../education/third_level_education/fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/tax_relief_for_third_level_fees.html">tax
relief for third level education fees</a>. The amount of relief you get depends
on the amount of tax you have paid.</p>

<p>This document explains how to get a tax refund if you have worked and are
now unemployed, getting <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">Illness
Benefit</a> or short-term <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/injury_benefit.html">Occupational
Injury Benefit</a>, or if you are still employed but think you have paid more
tax than you were liable to pay.</p>

<h3>Why would I get a tax refund?</h3>

<p>There are a number of reasons why you may now be liable to pay less tax than
previously thought and due a refund. Your tax liability may be reduced because
you are on unpaid sick leave or have become unemployed. </p>

<p>For <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/starting_work_and_changing_job/starting_work/tax_and_starting_work.html">PAYE</a>
workers your tax liability is spread out evenly over the year. To ensure that
this is achieved, your tax liability is normally calculated on a cumulative
basis. Any <a shape="rect" href="how_your_tax_is_calculated.html">tax credits
and standard rate cut-off point</a>, which is not used in a pay period, is
carried forward to the next pay period within that tax year.</p>

<p>This means that when an employer calculates your tax liability, they
actually calculate the total tax due from 1 January to the date which your most
recent wages are paid. This means if your income is reduced, for example, by
sickness or unemployment, you will have unused tax credits and may be due a tax
refund.</p>

<p>You may also get a refund if your tax liability has been incorrectly
calculated by your employer and you have overpaid tax.</p>

<p>A tax refund may also be paid if you have purchased goods or services for
which you can claim <a shape="rect" href="credits_and_reliefs/">tax
relief</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>If you are unemployed or out of work sick</h3>

<p>If tax has been deducted from your pay since 1 January last and you are now
unemployed, you may be entitled to a tax refund. If you have not paid any tax,
you will not be due a refund.</p>

<p>Jobseeker’s Benefit (JB), Illness Benefit (IB) and payments under the
Occupational Injury Benefit (OIB) Scheme (including Injury Benefit, Disablement
Benefit and Incapacity Supplement) are all taxable sources of income. However,
the first €13 per week of Jobseeker’s Benefit is not taxable. Any Increase
for a Qualified Child paid with Illness Benefit or a payment under the OIB
scheme is not taxable. </p>

<p>If you are getting <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_benefit.html">Jobseeker’s
Benefit</a>, Illness Benefit, or a payment under the Occupational Injury
Benefit Scheme and make a claim for a tax refund, the taxable proportion of
your JB, IB or OIB payment and your wages are added together to determine if
you are entitled to a refund. </p>

<h3>If you are employed and think you may have overpaid tax</h3>
</div>
If you think your employer has incorrectly calculated your tax liability you
must submit your <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/no_p45_no_p60.html">P60</a>
and written details of your claim. If your spouse or civil partner is working
you must also submit their P60. A P60 is given to you by your employer at the
end of each year.<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<h3>Unemployed or out of work sick</h3>

<p>The amount of tax refund depends on:</p>
<ul><li>The length of time you have been unemployed </li>
  <li>The amount of tax you have paid </li>
  <li>The amount of tax credits you have used </li>
  <li>The amount of your weekly <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/">social welfare payment</a>
  </li>
</ul><h3>How your tax refund is paid</h3>

<p>Revenue will issue a cheque if you are unemployed and due a tax refund. </p>

<p>If you are out of work sick, when you return to work your employer usually
refunds your tax in your first week's wages. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<h3>Unemployed <br></h3>

<p>You should apply 4 weeks from the date you become unemployed, however, if
emergency tax was being deducted by your former employer you should apply
<strong>immediately</strong>.</p>

<p>You should apply <strong>8 weeks</strong> from the date you became
unemployed, if you are getting another income which is taxable. This includes
<a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/taxation_of_social_welfare_payments.html">taxable
social welfare payments</a>. </p>

<p>Your application for a tax repayment because you are unemployed or out of
work sick, must be made on <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/forms/p50.pdf">tax repayment Form P50</a>
and sent to your tax office with Parts 2 and 3 of your <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/no_p45_no_p60.html">P45</a>.</p>

<h3>Unpaid sick leave</h3>

<p>When you return to work from unpaid sick leave, you should notify your tax
office of the amount of Illness Benefit paid during your illness. Revenue will
then issue you with your correct Tax Credit Certificate. Your employer will
also get a copy (showing totals only) and refund any tax you are due, when you
return to work. </p>

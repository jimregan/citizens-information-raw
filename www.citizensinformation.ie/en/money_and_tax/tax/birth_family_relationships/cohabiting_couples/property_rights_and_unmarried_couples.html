<h3>Buying a home together</h3>

<p>If you are buying (or thinking about buying) a home with your partner, you
should consider in advance which is the best home ownership option for you. In
Ireland, joint ownership of property for cohabiting couples can be held in one
of two ways;</p>
<ul><li>Joint tenancy </li>
  <li>Tenancy in common </li>
</ul><p>Considering which is the best option for you, means being prepared for what
you wish to happen in in the event of the <a href="inheritance_rights_and_unmarried_couples.html">death of either
partner</a>, or the <a shape="rect" href="../problems_in_marriages_and_relationships/property_rights_and_the_breakdown_of_a_non_marital_relationship.html">breakup
of your relationship</a>. </p>

<h3>Joint tenancy</h3>

<p>This means the whole property is owned by two people with the intention
that, when one dies, the other person will automatically own all of the
property. In situations where one person has paid for the property, the other
person may not get 50% of the proceeds if the house is sold. In situations such
as this, you need to check your situation with a solicitor. </p>

<h3>Tenancy in common</h3>

<p>This means the property is owned in defined shares by two people. For
example, 50/50, 75/25, 60/40, etc. Each person can leave their share of the
property to whomever they wish. (They may leave their share to their partner
for example, but they <span>must</span> <a shape="rect" href="/en/death/before_a_death/making_a_will.html">make a will</a> stating this
fact). If no will is made, the share becomes part of the estate of the deceased
partner and the other partner does not have any automatic right to the share.
Instead, the family (or even a separated spouse or civil partner) of the
deceased person can claim this share. You can read more about <a shape="rect" href="/en/death/the_deceaseds_estate/dealing_with_the_deceaseds_estate.html">dealing
with a deceased person's estate</a> here. </p>

<h3>The family home</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="../separation_and_divorce/family_home_protection_act.html">Family Home
Protection Act 1976</a> gives a spouse the right to veto any sale or lease of
the family home by the other spouse. In order to sell or lease the family home,
the written consent of both spouses must first be obtained. Under Part 4 of the
<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Civil
Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010</a>
similar provisions apply to the shared home of a couple in a civil
partnership.</p>

<p>These provisions do not apply to cohabiting couples. If you are living with
your partner in his/her house, there is no need for your partner to obtain your
written consent before he or she can sell or lease the house. </p>

<h3>Local authority housing</h3>

<p>The question of whether or not you may be allocated local authority housing
is generally based on your need for housing and whether you could afford to pay
for your own accommodation. Cohabiting couples may apply to be allocated local
authority housing. </p>

<p>Usually when married couples are allocated local authority accommodation,
the lease is in both their names as joint-tenants. This means that if one
spouse dies or leaves, the remaining spouse can take over the lease. It is also
possible for cohabiting couples to apply for the allocation of a house to be
held in joint-tenancy. </p>

<p>If you move in to a local authority house where your partner is already the
sole tenant, you may apply for joint tenancy after two years. </p>

<h3>Private rented accommodation and the private housing market</h3>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0008/index.html">Equal
Status Act 2000</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Equality
Act 2004</a>, a landlord cannot refuse to rent accommodation to you because of
your civil status. He or she also cannot discriminate against you in relation
to any of the services or amenities relating to the accommodation or end your
lease simply because you are not married or in a civil partnership. </p>

<p>Cohabiting couples are entitled to <a href="../../housing/owning_a_home/buying_a_home/">buy private houses</a> and
lending institutions will not refuse to give you a <a shape="rect" href="/en/housing/owning_a_home/help_with_buying_a_home/paying_for_a_home.html">mortgage</a>
simply because you are cohabiting. The main concern of lending institutions is
your ability to repay the loan.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If you feel that you and your partner have been discriminated against in the
area of housing, you should bring your complaint to the <a shape="rect" href="../../justice/law_and_rights/irish_human_rights_commission.html">Irish
Human Rights and Equality Commission</a> within two months of the
discriminatory act or decision. </p>

<p>If you are buying or considering buying property with your partner, you
should seek legal advice on the best option for you. </p>

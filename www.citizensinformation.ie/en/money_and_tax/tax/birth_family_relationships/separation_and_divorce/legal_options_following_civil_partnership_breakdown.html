<p>When a civil partnership first breaks up, the civil partners can informally
separate and live apart. A civil partnership breakdown can affect all areas of
a person' s life and most people will go on to regulate matters between them in
a legal context. There are two different ways of doing this:</p>
<ul><li><a shape="rect" href="separation_agreement.html">Separation
  agreement</a></li>
  <li><a shape="rect" href="dissolution_decrees.html">Dissolution</a></li>
</ul><p>A separation agreement is reached through agreement between the parties and
agreement can be achieved in a number of ways. However, only a decree of
dissolution dissolves the civil partnership and allows each party to marry.</p>

<p>In specific circumstances, a court can grant a <a shape="rect" href="../civil_annulment/nullity_of_civil_partnership.html">nullity
decree</a>. The effect of a nullity decree is that the court determines that no
civil partnership ever existed. The law in relation to nullity is complex, and
you should always seek legal advice to assess whether the circumstances exist
for a nullity application.</p>

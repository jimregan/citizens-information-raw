<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Budget 2016 was announced on 13 October 2015.</p>

<p>The main Budget changes that may affect people living in Ireland are set out
below. </p>

<p>This document sets out changes in the areas of taxation, social welfare,
health, housing, education, employment and other areas. It is an overview and
not a complete statement of the measures announced in Budget 2016.</p>

<p><strong>This document will be updated throughout the week as more details
become available.</strong></p>

<p>Some of the changes announced in the Budget come into effect immediately.
Others take effect from the beginning of January 2016 or later in 2016. Many
others have to be finalised before coming into effect. </p>

<p>Some elements of these measures may change when the legislation required to
bring them into effect is enacted. </p>

<p>For a full list of the Budget changes, please see the Department of Finance
website, <a href="http://www.budget.gov.ie">budget.gov.ie</a>. You can find a
summary of the social welfare changes on the Department of Social Protection's
website, <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Budget-2016.aspx">welfare.ie</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l01933">Taxation</h2>

<h3>Income tax</h3>

<p>The <strong>Home Carer's Tax Credit</strong> that is given to married
couples or civil partners where one spouse or civil partner works in the home
caring for a dependent person is increasing from €810 to €1,000 for 2016.
The home carer’s income threshold is increasing from €5,080 to €7,200.</p>

<p>A <strong>new Earned Income Credit</strong> of €550 is being introduced
for taxpayers earning self-employed trading or professional income in certain
cases and to business owner/managers who are ineligible for a PAYE credit on
their salary income.</p>

<h3>Universal Social Charge (USC)</h3>

<p>Incomes of €13,000 (was €12,012) or less will be exempt from USC in
2016. Once your income is over this limit, you will pay the relevant rate of
USC on all of your income. The rates and thresholds for USC will change as
follows: </p>

      <td>11%</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>Medical card holders and people aged 70 years and over whose aggregate
income does not exceed €60,000 will pay a reduced rate as follows:</p>
<ul><li>The first €12,012 @ 1% </li>
  <li>Income over €12,012.01 @ 3% </li>
</ul><h3>PRSI</h3>

<h4>Employee PRSI</h4>

<p>A new <strong>weekly tapered PRSI credit of €12</strong> is being
introduced for employees insured at Class A whose earnings are between
€352.01 and €424 in a week. A similar PRSI credit will apply to Class E and
Class H employees with weekly earnings between €352.01 and €422 or €424,
respectively.</p>

<p>The maximum PRSI credit of €12 per week applies to gross weekly earnings
of €352.01. A person earning €352.01 pays €14.08 PRSI (4%). After the
€12 credit is deducted they will pay PRSI of €2.08. </p>

<p>For people earning between €352.01 and €424, the credit of €12 is
reduced by one-sixth of earnings over €352.01. For example, a person earning
€377 would get a PRSI credit of €7.83 – this is one-sixth of the
difference between €377 and €352.01 subtracted from the maximum credit of
€12. There is no PRSI credit once earnings exceed €424 (January 2016). This
provision will reduce the weekly PRSI bill for over 88,000 employees.</p>

<h4>Employer PRSI</h4>

<p>The lower 8.5% Class A rate of employer PRSI will apply to weekly earnings
up to €376. This threshold will increase from the current €356 (January
2016). This provision will benefit 26,000 employers. These PRSI provisions will
cost €21 million in 2016. </p>

<h3>Excise duties</h3>

<p>The excise duty on <strong>a packet of 20 cigarettes</strong> is increasing
by 50 cent (including VAT) with a pro-rata increase on other tobacco products,
with effect from midnight on 13 October 2015.</p>

<p>The rate of <strong>Motor Tax</strong> is being reduced for all vehicles
above 4,000kgs, with a new annual rate of €500 for vehicle between 4,000kgs
and 12,000kgs and €900 for vehicles over 12,000kgs.</p>

<h3>Capital Acquisitions Tax</h3>

<p>The Group A tax-free threshold, which applies primarily to gifts and
inheritances from parents to their children, is being increased from €225,000
to €280,000. This increase applies in respect of gifts or inheritances
received on or after 14 October 2015.</p>

<h3>Stamp duty</h3>

<p>The current €2.50 per annum <strong>charge on ATM cards</strong> and €5
on combined (ATM and debit) cards is being abolished from 1 January 2016.</p>

<p>A <strong>new 12 cent fee per ATM withdrawal</strong> is being introduced
from 1 January 2016. The total fee paid per annum per card will be capped at
€2.50 on ATM cards and €5 on combined (ATM and debit) cards.</p>

<h3>Contactless payments</h3>

<p>The transaction limit on contactless payments is being increased from €15
to €30 on 31 October 2015.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Local Property Tax (LPT)</h3>

<p>Following a review of the Local Property Tax, it is proposed that the
revaluation date for the Local Property Tax should be postponed from 2016 to
2019. The postponement of the date means that home owners will continue to pay
LPT based on the original valuations that applied for 2013-2016.</p>

<p>The review also proposes some changes as regards exemptions from LPT for
properties significantly affected by pyrite.</p>

<h3>Other income tax measures</h3>

<p>The <strong>Home Renovation Incentive</strong> is being extended until 31
December 2016.</p>

<p>The changes announced to the <strong>Employment and Investment Incentive
scheme</strong> in Budget 2015 are being commenced and the scheme is being
amended to include expansion works on existing nursing homes.</p>

<p><strong>General Stock Relief</strong>, <strong>Stock Relief for Young
Trained Farmers</strong>, <strong>Stock Relief for Registered Farm
Partnerships</strong> and the <strong>Stamp Duty Exemption for Young Trained
Farmers</strong> are being extended until 31 December 2018.</p>

<p>A <strong>new farm succession transfer partnership model</strong> is being
introduced, subject to EU State Aid approval.</p>

<p>Profits or gains from the occupation of <strong>woodlands</strong> are being
removed from the high earners’ restriction.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lae27e">Social Welfare</h2>

<p>The total social protection budget in 2016 will increase by over €250
million. Total expenditure in 2016 will be €19.638 billion.</p>

<h3>Payments to families and children</h3>

<p>An extra €98 million is being provided to support families with children
in 2016. </p>

<h4>Paternity Benefit</h4>

<p>A new Paternity Benefit is being introduced for fathers availing of the new
2 weeks’ statutory paternity leave. It will be paid at €230 per week in
respect of births from September 2016. The PRSI contribution conditions will be
the same as those for Maternity Benefit (September 2016). </p>

<h4>Child Benefit</h4>

<p>The rate of Child Benefit will increase by €5 to €140 per month for each
child (January 2016). Families with twins receive one and a half times the
normal monthly rate for each child. Families with multiple births receive Child
Benefit at double the normal monthly rate for each child.</p>

<h4>Family Income Supplement (FIS)</h4>

<p>Family Income Supplement thresholds will be increased by €5 for each of
the first two children per week. The threshold for the third and all other
children will increase by €10 (January 2016). </p>

<p>The level of FIS payment will continue to be based on 60% of the shortfall
between net weekly family income and the applicable weekly family threshold.
This measure will cost €18 million. It will benefit nearly 60,000 families
and over 131,000 children. It will also result in an additional 1,500
households and 3,365 children becoming eligible for FIS. </p>

<h4>School Meals Programme</h4>

<p>An additional €3 million is being provided towards the School Meals
Programme, increasing the funding to €42 million in 2016.</p>

<h3>Older people and carers</h3>

<h4>State pensions</h4>

<p>The <strong>weekly rate for people getting State pensions</strong> will
increase by €3 per week. Payments to carers and widowers, widows and
surviving civil partners aged over 66 will also increase by €3 per week

<p><strong>Increases for Qualified Adults</strong> aged under 66 years will go
up by €2 and increases for qualified adults aged 66 years or over will go up
by €2.70 (January 2016). These changes will benefit 583,000 recipients of
payments and 93,500 dependants. </p>

<h4>Carers</h4>

<p>The name of the <strong>Respite Care Grant</strong> will be changed to the
<strong>Carer’s Support Grant</strong> to better reflect how it is used by
recipients. The grant will increase by €325 to €1,700 per year for each
person being cared for (June 2016). This will benefit 86,000 carers. </p>

<p><strong>Carer’s Allowance</strong> will be paid for 12 weeks (currently 6
weeks) after the death of the person being cared for (January 2016). </p>

<h4>Free travel</h4>

<p>There is €3 million in additional funding for the Free Travel Scheme in
2016. This provision will provide for the increased numbers of people eligible
for the scheme.</p>

<h3>People of working age</h3>

<h4>Jobseeker’s Transitional payment</h4>

<p>The earnings disregard for Jobseeker’s Transitional payment will increase
from €60 to €90 per week for existing and new recipients. All earnings
above €90 will be assessed at 50% rather than the current assessment of 60%
(January 2016). This measure will cost €8 million a year and will benefit
5,900 people in 2016. </p>

<h4>Employment activation</h4>

<p>There will be an increase of €2.50 per week in top-up payments paid
towards meals and travel costs for Community Employment (CE), Rural Social
Scheme (RSS), Gateway, Job Initiative, Tús and JobBridge participants (January
2016). This will benefit 43,000 people across these five activation schemes.</p>

<h3>Fuel Allowance</h3>

<p>Fuel Allowance will increase by €2.50 per week to €22.50 per week. Fuel
Allowance is paid to people getting long-term social welfare payments -
including pensioners, people with disabilities, people parenting alone and
jobseekers (January 2016). This provision will benefit 381,000 households. </p>

<h3>Christmas Bonus</h3>

<p>A 75% Christmas Bonus will be paid in December 2015 to people getting a
long-term social welfare payment (minimum payment of €20). </p>

<p>People getting the following payments will receive the Christmas Bonus: </p>
<ul><li>State Pensions and Widow's/Widower's/Surviving Civil Partner's
  Pensions</li>
  <li>Invalidity Pension, Blind Pension, Disability Allowance, Carer's
    Allowance, Domiciliary Care Allowance and guardian's payments</li>
  <li>Long-term Jobseeker's Allowance including Jobseeker's Transition payment,
    Pre-Retirement Allowance, One-Parent Family Payment, Deserted Wife's
    Benefit and Allowance and Farm Assist </li>
  <li>Back to Work Allowance, Back to Work Family Dividend, Community
    Employment, Rural Social Scheme, Tús, Gateway and Job Initiative</li>
</ul><p>This will benefit 1.23 million people at a cost of €197 million.</p>

<h3>Pay-Related Social Insurance (PRSI)</h3>

<h4>Employee PRSI</h4>

<p>A new <strong>weekly tapered PRSI credit of €12</strong> is being
introduced for employees insured at Class A whose earnings are between
€352.01 and €424 in a week. A similar PRSI credit will apply to Class E and
Class H employees with weekly earnings between €352.01 and €422 or €424,
respectively.</p>

<p>The maximum PRSI credit of €12 per week applies to gross weekly earnings
of €352.01. A person earning €352.01 pays €14.08 PRSI (4%). After the
€12 credit is deducted they will pay PRSI of €2.08. </p>

<p>For people earning between €352.01 and €424, the credit of €12 is
reduced by one-sixth of earnings over €352.01. For example, a person earning
€377 would get a PRSI credit of €7.83 – this is one-sixth of the
difference between €377 and €352.01 subtracted from the maximum credit of
€12. There is no PRSI credit once earnings exceed €424 (January 2016). This
provision will reduce the weekly PRSI bill for over 88,000 employees.</p>

<h4>Employer PRSI</h4>

<p>The lower 8.5% Class A rate of employer PRSI will apply to weekly earnings
up to €376. This threshold will increase from the current €356 (January
2016). This provision will benefit 26,000 employers. These PRSI provisions will
cost €21 million in 2016. </p>

<h3>Housing</h3>

<p>A total of €811 million is allocated for housing programmes and the
continued delivery of the <strong>Social Housing Strategy 2020</strong>. In
addition, local authorities will directly provide some €112 million in
funding to meet housing needs.</p>

<p><strong>NAMA is to work with developers to deliver a target of 20,000
residential units before the end of 2020</strong>. 90% of these units will be
in the Greater Dublin Area and approximately 75% of them will be houses, mainly
starter homes. This will require funding of the order of €4.5 billion.</p>

<p>Funding for the <strong>Seniors Alert programme</strong> is increased by
10%, to provide 10,000 monitored alarms for older people.</p>

<p>A new <strong>affordable rental pilot scheme</strong> will be funded by
€10 million from the proceeds of the sale of Bord Gáis Eireann.</p>

<h4>Social housing</h4>

<p>The current allocation for <strong>social housing</strong> is being
increased by €69 million to €414 million, with a view to securing
accommodation for an additional 14,000 households. </p>

<p>It is planned to provide <strong>over 9,500 social housing units</strong> by
2018, funded through direct investment and public/private partnership, with
over 3,100 of these social housing units to be provided in 2016. </p>

<p>Local authorities are to provide <strong>more than 1,000 new housing
units</strong> through a programme of construction and acquisitions.</p>

<p>Under the <strong>Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS)</strong> some 450 units
are to be provided for people with specific needs in 2016. </p>

<p>€47.7 million is allocated for the <strong>Housing Assistance Payment
(HAP)</strong> in 2016, with a target of 10,000 households for transfer to
HAP.</p>

<p>€135 million is allocated for the <strong>Rental Accommodation Scheme
(RAS)</strong> with a target of 1,000 new RAS transfers.</p>

<p>€70 million is provided for <strong>upgrading the energy efficiency of
social housing stock</strong>. </p>

<p>It is expected that 1,500 vacant <strong>social housing units will be
refurbished</strong> and brought back to productive use. A total of €85
million will be provided for regeneration/remedial works in disadvantaged
communities in 2016.</p>

<p>€17 million is allocated for the <strong>mortgage-to-rent
scheme</strong>.</p>

<h4>Traveller accommodation and support</h4>

<p>€4.3 million is being provided for <strong>Traveller accommodation and
support services</strong> and €5.5 million is being provided for a range of
<strong>Traveller-specific accommodation schemes</strong>.</p>

<h4>Homelessness</h4>

<p>The current allocation for <strong>addressing homelessness</strong> is
increased by €17 million to €70 million.</p>

<p>Funding is available under the Capital Plan to provide <strong>500 modular
housing units</strong> for homeless families. </p>

<p>Rent limits for the <strong>Homeless HAP Pilot</strong> in Dublin will be
increased.</p>

<h4>Adaptations and remediation</h4>

<p>€45 million is provided for approximately 8,500 <strong>housing adaptation
grants for older people and people with a disability</strong>.</p>

<p>€19 million is provided for the <strong>Pyrite Remediation
Scheme</strong>.</p>

<p>€5 million is provided towards a new <strong>Lead Remediation Grant
Scheme</strong> to help homeowners in addressing the issue of lead in their
drinking water.</p>

<h4>Local Property Tax (LPT)</h4>

<p>Following a review of the Local Property Tax, it is proposed that the
revaluation date for the Local Property Tax should be postponed from 2016 to
2019. The postponement of the date means that home owners will continue to pay
LPT based on the original valuations that applied for 2013-2016.</p>

<p>The review also proposes some changes as regards exemptions from LPT for
properties significantly affected by pyrite.</p>

<h4>Housing tax reliefs</h4>

<p>The <strong>Home Renovation Incentive</strong> is being extended until 31
December 2016.</p>

<p><strong>Rent Tax Relief</strong> will continue to be reduced, as announced
in Budget 2011:</p>

<table style="width: 100%"><caption><strong>Maximum qualifying amounts for 2016</strong></caption>
  <col><col><tbody><tr><td>Single under 55 years</td>
      <td>€400</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Single over 55 years</td>
      <td>€800</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Married or in a Civil Partnership, Widowed or a Surviving Civil
        Partner, under 55 years</td>
      <td>€800</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Married or in a Civil Partnership, Widowed or a Surviving Civil
        Partner, over 55 years</td>
      <td>€1,600</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<p>No new changes were announced to <strong>Mortgage Interest Relief</strong>,
which only applies to mortgages taken out by 31 December 2012. The previously
announced rates and ceilings will apply in 2016 in accordance with the <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/tax-relief-source-mortgage-rates.html">tables
published by Revenue</a>.</p>

<h3>Employment</h3>

<h4>Minimum wage</h4>

<p>From 1 January 2016, the statutory minimum wage will increase to €9.15
from €8.65 per hour.</p>

<h4>Paternity leave</h4>

<p>Statutory paternity leave of 2 weeks is to be introduced, together with a
new Paternity Benefit, in respect of births from September 2016.</p>

<h3>Small and medium businesses</h3>

<h4>Extension of 3-year corporation tax relief for start-up companies</h4>

<p>This measure provides relief from corporation tax on trading income (and
certain capital gains) of new start-up companies in the first 3 years of
trading. This relief is being extended to 2018. </p>

<h4>Earned Income Credit</h4>

<p>An Earned Income Credit of €550 is being introduced for taxpayers earning
self-employed trading or professional income and for business owners or
managers who are ineligible for a PAYE credit on their salary income.</p>

<h4>Revised CGT entrepreneur’s relief</h4>

<p>A reduced rate of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is being introduced for
individuals who propose to sell their business. A lower CGT rate of 20% will
apply to the net chargeable gains arising on disposals of assets comprising the
whole or a discrete part of a trade or business, subject to a lifetime limit of
€1 million on such gains, with effect from 1 January 2016. </p>

<h4>Reduced fees for card payments</h4>

<p>Interchange fees are charged to retailers for both debit and credit card
transactions. To reduce the costs to retailers of accepting card payments, a
maximum fee limit is now being set on interchange for both debit and credit
cards. Both of these limits will come into force on 9 December 2015. Some
smaller schemes will be exempted from these new limits until 9 December 2016,
to give them time to restructure their business models as required. </p>

<h4>Employment And Investment Incentive (EII) and Start Up Relief For
Entrepreneurs (SURE)</h4>

<p>The EII and SURE are being amended to comply with State aid rules. In
addition, expansion works to existing nursing homes will qualify for the EII
and the changes announced to the EII in Budget 2015 are being commenced from 13
October 2015. </p>

<h4>Knowledge Development Box</h4>

<p>The Knowledge Development Box (KDB) is being introduced to encourage
companies to develop intellectual property in Ireland. The KDB will provide
that a corporation tax rate of 6.25% will apply to the profits arising to
certain intellectual property assets which are the result of qualifying
research and development activity that is carried out in Ireland.</p>

<h4>Excise duty relief for microbreweries</h4>

<p>The tax relief reducing the standard rate of Alcohol Products Tax by 50% on
beer produced in microbreweries will now be available upfront as well as
through a rebate.</p>

<h4>Valued Added Tax (VAT)</h4>

<p>The 9% rate of VAT is being retained for tourism-related activities.</p>

<h3>Supports for unemployed people</h3>

<h4>Employment schemes</h4>

<p>Participants on Community Employment, Rural Social Scheme, Tús, Gateway and
JobBridge will receive a top up payment of €2.50 per week towards meals and
travel costs from January 2016.</p>

<h3>Education and Training </h3>

<h4>Childcare</h4>

<p>From September 2016, the <strong>Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE)
Scheme</strong> will be extended to children aged between 3 years and 5 years 6
months, or until they start primary school. Children will be able to enroll in
pre-school at three different points in the year (September, January and April)
in order to access the scheme. </p>

<p>The number of places available under the <strong>Community Childcare
Subvention Programme</strong> will increase to 8,000. </p>

<p>A number of <strong>supports to enable children with disabilities to fully
participate in pre-school care and education</strong> will be phased in during
2016 at a cost of €15 million. Supports will include grants for equipment,
appliances, minor alterations, access to therapeutic intervention and training
for childcare staff.</p>

<p>€3.5 million is to be provided for <strong>measures to improve quality in
childcare</strong>. </p>

<p>A new <strong>single affordable childcare programme</strong> will be

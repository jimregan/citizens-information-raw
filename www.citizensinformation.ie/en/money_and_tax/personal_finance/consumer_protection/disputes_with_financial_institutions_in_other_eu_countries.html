<p>FIN-NET (the cross-border out-of-court complaints network for financial
services) is a mechanism that allows unresolved disputes between you and a
financial services provider that is based in another European country to be
settled out of court. FIN-NET is a network made up of the existing national
complaint schemes for financial services in Europe. FIN-NET aims to:</p>
<ul><li>Provide you with easy and informed access to out-of-court redress in
    cross-border disputes </li>
  <li>Ensure the efficient exchange of information between European schemes so
    that your cross-border complaints can be handled as quickly, efficiently
    and professionally as possible </li>
  <li>Ensure that out-of-court dispute settlement schemes from different <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/eu-eea-countries">European
    Economic Area</a> countries apply with a common set of minimum guarantees
    for consumers. </li>
</ul><p>FIN-NET is only an alternative to judicial redress and decisions or
recommendations of out-of-court bodies are not enforceable in the same way as
court decisions. However, in the majority of cases, financial institutions do
follow the recommendations of the complaint body even if they are not binding.
</p>

<h3>How FIN-NET can help you</h3>
</div>
FIN-NET is designed to allow you to contact the out-of-court complaint body
<span>in your home country</span> even when you have a complaint against a
foreign financial firm. This helps you to identify the relevant complaint
scheme and gives you the necessary information about the scheme and its
complaint procedure. You can find comprehensive information about each
participating national scheme on the <a shape="rect" href="http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/fin-net/members_en.htm">FIN-NET
website</a>. You can also receive information about relevant foreign complaint
schemes in your own language from FIN-NET members in your home country. <div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l9021d">How your complaint is handled by FIN-NET</h2>

<p>When you receive all the necessary information about the relevant complaints
scheme and you have decided to file a complaint with it, you can leave your
complaint with the FIN-NET member in your home country. If the FIN-NET member
in your home country does not deal with the complaint itself, it will transfer
it to the relevant scheme in your financial service provider's country. In some
cases, it may be more efficient to contact the relevant complaints scheme
directly and in these cases, the FIN-NET member in your home country will ask
you to do so. </p>

<p>FIN-NET schemes aim to allow you to make your complaint at least in the
language of your financial contract or the language in which you have usually
dealt with your financial service provider. </p>

<p>Member schemes of FIN-NET handle cross-border complaints with the same
efficiency and the same level of care as they handle domestic complaints. If
the complaints scheme needs any further information or documentation from you,
it will contact you directly. If the scheme needs more general information,
that is, information about the legislative framework for consumer protection in
your country, it will co-operate directly with the FIN-NET member in your home
country. </p>

<p>Member schemes of FIN-NET are linked through a Memorandum of Understanding
which lays down the procedural framework for cross-border co-operation and
basic principles for out-of-court dispute settlement. The Memorandum of
Understanding includes a declaration of intent from participating complaints
bodies to apply the quality standards set out in European Commission
Recommendation 98/257/EC on principles applicable to bodies responsible for
out-of-court settlement of consumer disputes. </p>

<p>This Recommendation consists of 7 principles, which include: </p>
<ul><li>Independence of the dispute settlement body to ensure the impartiality of
    its actions </li>
  <li>Transparency of the scheme to ensure that you have all the necessary
    information about the procedure and that the results obtained can be
    objectively assessed </li>
  <li>An adversarial procedure to ensure that you can present all your views
    and are informed about the arguments of the other party to the dispute </li>
  <li>Effectiveness of the procedure to ensure that you will benefit from the
    advantages of an alternative dispute settlement, that is, you have access
    without being obliged to use a legal representative, a procedure that is
    free of charge or of moderate cost, a procedure that is swift and a dispute
    settlement body that assumes an active role, thereby enabling it to take
    into consideration any factors conducive to a settlement of the dispute
  </li>
  <li>Legality to guarantee that the decision taken by the dispute settlement
    body does not deprive you of the protection afforded to you by the relevant
    consumer protection legislation </li>
  <li>Freedom to ensure that the decision taken may be binding on you only if
    you are informed of its binding nature in advance and specifically accept
    this after the dispute in question has arisen </li>
  <li>Representation to ensure that you can be represented in the procedure by
    a third party if you wish. </li>
</ul><p>Only schemes that the <a href="../../../government_in_ireland/european_government/eu_institutions/european_commission.html">European
Commission</a> has been notified about by their member states can participate
in FIN-NET. </p>

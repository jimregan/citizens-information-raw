<p>Financial institutions such as banks, credit unions and building societies
use different terms for the interest you are charged or earn on their financial
products.</p>

<p>The four most common terms you will see are:</p>
<ul><li>Annual Percentage Rate (APR) </li>
  <li>Equivalent Annual Rate (EAR) </li>
  <li>Annual Equivalent Rate (AER) </li>
  <li>Compound Annual Return (CAR) </li>
</ul><p>APR and EAR are used for the interest you are charged on money you
<strong>borrow</strong>. </p>

<p>AER, CAR and EAR can be used for the interest you earn on money you
<strong>save</strong>. </p>

<h3>APR and EAR</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="comparing_interest_on_savings_and_investments.html">Annual Percentage
Rate (APR)</a> is a calculation of the overall cost of your loan. It is
expressed as an annual rate that represents the actual yearly cost of the funds
borrowed. It takes into account all the costs during the term of the loan
including any set up charges and the interest rate. This means that fees and
charges are added to the loan amount before interest is calculated. </p>

<p>APR is calculated each year on the declining principal of a loan. The
declining principal is the amount you still owe, not the original amount you
borrowed. The higher the APR the more it will cost you to borrow money.</p>

<p>All lenders are required to quote the interest rate on a loan or credit card
as an APR. These requirements are set down in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0024/sec0021.html#zza24y1995s21">Section
21 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995</a>. </p>

<p>You can use the APR to compare loans as long as they are for the same amount
and the same term. For example, a loan with an APR of 15% is more expensive
than one with an APR of 11%. You cannot use APR to compare loans of different
terms – if the terms are different you should look at the <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/choosing-a-loan#costofcredit">cost of
credit</a>. The cost of credit is the real cost of borrowing. It is the
difference between the amount you borrow and the total you repay.</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/loan-calculator">consumerhelp.ie loan
calculator</a> to work out the monthly repayments and cost of credit for loans
depending on:</p>
<ul><li>How much you want to borrow or</li>
  <li>How much you can afford to pay back each month</li>
</ul><p>The <strong><em>Equivalent Annual Rate</em> (EAR)</strong> is used to
calculate interest on accounts that can either be in credit or overdrawn. (If
you have money in your account, your account is in credit). EAR shows you the
rate of interest charged or earned. For example, a current account with an
overdraft facility can have 2 EAR rates – one for interest paid when the
account is in credit and another for interest charged when the account is
overdrawn. If only one EAR is quoted you should find out whether it applies to
your credit balance or your overdraft. Always check the interest rate charged
on your overdraft facility with your bank.</p>

<p>EAR takes into account when the interest is charged or earned, and any
additional charges. Additional charges could include quarterly fees, set-up
charges, and so on.</p>

<p>EAR calculates the interest as if it is paid once a year, even if it is paid
twice or three times per year. This allows you to use EAR rates to compare an
account where the interest is paid or charged monthly with one where the
interest is paid or charged annually.</p>

<p>The higher the EAR, the more interest you will be charged or earn. </p>

<h3><strong>AER and CAR</strong></h3>

<p><em>Annual Equivalent Rate</em> (AER) and <em>Compound Annual Return</em>
(CAR) both show you the real interest you will have gained on savings or
interest-based investments at the end of a year. </p>

<p>AER is the amount of interest earned in a year. AER is useful for comparing
the return on savings accounts because it shows how much is earned regardless
of how often interest is credited to an account. It is standard practice in
Ireland to list interest in AER form for savings accounts. You may earn less
than the AER because your money may not be invested for as long as a year. AER
is usually quoted without taking DIRT into account.</p>

<p>Sometimes firms use <em>Compound Annual Rate (CAR)</em> instead of AER on
savings and investment products. CAR is a measure of the rate of return on a
deposit or investment. You can use it to compare different accounts. If there
is €110 in an account, a year after €100 was lodged in it the return, or
CAR, is 10%.</p>

<p>AER and CAR both take into account how often interest is paid because when
the interest is added to your savings your savings increase. As a result, the
next time the interest on your savings is calculated this increases too. This
called compound interest.</p>

<p><strong>An example of compound interest:</strong></p>

<p>If a financial institution quotes an interest rate of 4% per year compounded
every 6 months the financial institution pays 2% compound interest every 6
months. The interest paid at the end of 6 months, actually earns interest for
the second 6 months of the year. For this reason, 4% compounded every 6 months,
is not the same as 4% compounded annually.</p>

<p>You invest <strong>€500</strong> with your financial institution at a rate
of <strong>4%</strong> each year, compounded every 6 months. The €10 interest
for the first 6 months is simply 2% of €500. This is then added to the
initial investment to give a running total of €510. The interest for the
second six months of the year is 2% of €510 = €10.20. The effective annual
interest rate is therefore 20.20 /500 x 100 = 4.04%.</p>

<p>If a financial institution, quotes an AER or CAR rate for an account, there
may also be terms and conditions attached to that account which can stop you
from getting the full rate. For example, you may not get the full rate if you
withdraw your savings before a certain date.</p>

<p>AER and CAR do not take into account fees or charges.</p>

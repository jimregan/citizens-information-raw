<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2003/act/2/enacted/en/html">Unclaimed
Life Assurance Policies Act 2003</a> requires insurance companies to identify
and contact the owners of unclaimed life insurance policies. If the owners
cannot be traced, the proceeds of the policies will be transferred to the <a shape="rect" href="../financial_institutions/dormant_bank_accounts_in_ireland.html">Dormant
Accounts Fund</a>, which is managed by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ntma.ie">National Treasury Management Agency</a>. </p>

<p>The contents of the Dormant Accounts Fund are invested and the surplus
disbursed by the Dormant Accounts Disbursement Fund to be used on programmes or
projects to help people with disabilities and people who are economically,
socially or educationally disadvantaged. </p>

<h3>When is a life insurance policy considered to be dormant?</h3>

<p>The dormancy period depends on whether the life assurance policy has a
specified term or not. If the policy has a specified term, it will be
considered dormant if the customer has not been in contact with the insurance
company for 5 years from the date the policy matured or the company's last
communication with the customer, whichever is later. If the policy does not
have a specified term, it will be considered to be dormant if there has been no
communication between the company and the customer for 15 years.</p>

<p>Dormant life assurance policies must be transferred to the Dormant Accounts
Fund in April of each year.</p>

<p>You have the right to claim the funds contained in your dormant life
assurance policy at any time.</p>

<p>There is no time-bar on account holders or their next of kin reclaiming
dormant funds, as their rights are preserved. This means that even if the funds
have been transferred to the Dormant Accounts Fund, you or your next of kin
still have a claim on your funds.</p>

<h3>What life insurance policies are covered?</h3>

<p>The Unclaimed Life Assurance Act applies to all insurance undertakings in
Ireland and all life assurance policies that have been taken out by Irish
residents, with the exception of policies that form part of the assets of <a shape="rect" href="../pensions/occupational_pensions.html">occupational pension
schemes</a>, group <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/health_insurance/private_health_insurance.html">health
insurance</a> or <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">disability
benefit</a> schemes and sponsored superannuation schemes. </p>

<h3>What do insurance companies have to do under the terms of the Unclaimed
Life Assurance Act?</h3>

<p>Insurance companies must personally contact customers whose life insurance
policies are worth €500 or more and tell them how to claim the proceeds of
the policies. Companies must also place advertisements in the national press
twice yearly to inform customers whose policies are worth less than €500. </p>

<p>Insurance companies must keep a register of unclaimed policies. </p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>The insurance companies must calculate the cash value of unclaimed life
insurance policies on the date that they are transferred to the Dormant
Accounts Fund. Companies must only transfer the investment value of the policy
and must retain the insurance element. </p>

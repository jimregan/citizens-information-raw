<p>Insurance is a way of protecting yourself from any costs that may arise from
damage to your property or your health. A premium is the amount of money you
pay to an insurance company to have an insurance policy to cover you for all or
part of these costs. Insurance companies assess the risk on a particular policy
and then calculate the premium to be charged. You can pay a premium monthly or
annually. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has
published <a href="http://www.nca.ie/nca/choosing-insurance">a range of guides
that explain how different types of insurance work</a>.</p>

<p>Insurance policies are generally renewed once a year. Coming up to renewal
date, you should shop around to see if you are getting the best value for your
money. The CCPC has also developed <a href="http://www.nca.ie/compare">a range
of insurance cost surveys that help you find the best value insurance</a>.</p>

<p>Different policies have different terms and conditions so make sure you know
what the terms and conditions of your policy are. It is important to understand
exactly what your insurance policy covers when you buy it.</p>

<h3>Home insurance </h3>

<p>You are not obliged by law to insure your home but if you have a mortgage,
most lenders will insist that your house is appropriately insured. In general,
your insurance should cover contents as well as the structure of your home. The
CCPC has <a href="http://www.nca.ie/nca/home-insurance#home_insurance">detailed
information on home insurance</a>.</p>

<h3>Mortgage protection insurance</h3>

<p>When taking out a mortgage, you need to consider how it will be paid off in
the event of your death and you will generally be required to take out mortgage
protection insurance. You may also consider how to continue repayments if your
income falls, due to illness, unemployment or other reasons. You can find out
more about <a href="../../../housing/owning_a_home/buying_a_home/mortgage_protection.html">insurance
protection on mortgages</a>.</p>

<h3>Motor insurance </h3>

<p>It is a criminal offence for drivers to drive uninsured on public roads in
Ireland. <a shape="rect" href="../../../../travel_and_recreation/motoring_1/motor_tax_and_insurance/motor_insurance.html">You
can find out more about motor insurance</a>. </p>

<h3>Health insurance</h3>

<p>Health insurance is used to pay for private care in hospital or from various
health professionals in hospitals or in their practices. There are a number of
health insurers in Ireland. <a shape="rect" href="/en/health/health_insurance/private_health_insurance.html">You can find out
more about health insurance</a>.</p>

<h3>Travel insurance</h3>

<p>Travel insurance can cover you if you become ill or have an accident while
you are on holidays or travelling. If you are travelling within the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/eu-eea-countries">EEA</a> or
Switzerland, you should have a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.ehic.ie/">European Health Insurance Card</a> which allows you
to access health care services. In general, travel insurance should supplement
the services available to people with a European Health Insurance Card. You can
find out more about <a shape="rect" href="/en/travel_and_recreation/travel_abroad/health_issues.html">travel insurance
and other health issues when travelling abroad</a>.</p>

<h3>Life insurance </h3>

<p>A <a href="http://www.nca.ie/nca/life-insurance">life insurance</a> policy
provides money for dependants if you die. Life insurance policies are important
if you have dependants (such as your spouse, partner or children). <br></p>

<p>If you have any problems with an insurer you should first take this up with
the customer service department of the insurer (or your broker/agent if you are
using one). The <a href="../financial_institutions/central_bank_and_financial_services_authority_of_ireland.html">Central
Bank of Ireland</a> enforces the <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/processes/consumer-protection-code/Pages/codes-of-conduct.aspx">Consumer
Protection Code</a> for financial services providers (including insurers and
intermediaries). The code sets out how they deal with their customers.</p>

<p>If you are not satisfied with how a financial services provider is dealing
with you, or you believe that they are not following the principles or rules of
the Code, you should first complain to the provider. Under the Code, financial
services providers must have a complaints procedure in place and must handle
your complaint speedily, efficiently and fairly. There are detailed rules in
the Code about how often a firm should contact you to keep you updated on your
complaint.</p>

<p>If you cannot resolve your problem or if you are not satisfied with how your
complaint is being handled, you can take your complaint to the <a href="http://www.financialombudsman.ie/">Financial Services Ombudsman</a>. The
Ombudsman is an independent, statutory body that can investigate your
complaint.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.insuranceireland.eu/">Insurance Ireland</a> provides
consumer information and <a href="http://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-information/insurance-information-service">a
free Insurance Information Service (IIS)</a> for members of the public. The IIS
can help you if you want information about insurance, or if you need help in
resolving a problem with your insurance company. This service will also
investigate complaints that fall outside the scope of the Financial Services
Ombudsman.</p>

<p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission gives information and
advice about <a href="http://www.nca.ie/nca/making-a-claim#how%20an%20insurer">making claims</a>
and <a href="http://www.nca.ie/nca/financial-complaints">financial
complaints</a>.</p>

<p>The Pensions Authority (formerly known as the Pensions Board) provides for
the proper administration of pension schemes and the protection of pension
rights for people living in Ireland. </p>

<p>The Authority is the regulatory body for <a shape="rect" href="occupational_pensions.html">occupational pension schemes</a> and <a shape="rect" href="personal_retirement_savings_accounts.html">Personal
Retirement Savings Accounts</a> (PRSAs) and also has a role in the development
of pension policy in general. </p>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2013/act/20/enacted/en/html">Social
Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013</a> the Pensions Board
was renamed the Pensions Authority and its Chief Executive become the Pensions
Regulator. <a href="http://www.pensionsauthority.ie/en/News_Press/News_Press_Archive/The_Pensions_Board_is_renamed_the_Pensions_Authority.html">These
changes took effect from 7 March 2014.</a></p>

<p>Oversight of the Pensions Authority will be provided by a three-person
board. The Pensions Regulator will continue to perform the Chief Executive
functions of the Pensions Authority. A separate <a href="http://www.pensionscouncil.ie/en/">Pensions Council</a> was set up to
advise the Minister for Social Protection on matters relating to policy on
pensions and protect the consumer interest. </p>

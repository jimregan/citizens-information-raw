<p>The Pensions Ombudsman has the power to investigate and determine your
complaints concerning disputes of fact or law and errors in relation to
occupational pension schemes and <a shape="rect" href="personal_retirement_savings_accounts.html">Personal Retirement Savings
Accounts (PRSA)</a>. The Ombudsman has the power to give any directions
necessary to resolve the complaint or dispute and can give financial
compensation (redress) but this cannot exceed the actual loss of benefit under
the occupational pension scheme or Personal Retirement Savings Account. The
Ombudsman does not have the power to award legal costs. All decisions made by
the Ombudsman are binding between the parties subject to a right of appeal by
either party to the <a shape="rect" href="../../../../../justice/courts_system/high_court.html">High Court</a>. </p>

<p>The Government has announced the intended amalgamation of the Office of the
Pensions Ombudsman with the Financial Services Ombudsman’s Bureau. The
legislation to give effect to this amalgamation is not in yet in place.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>There are certain time limits for bringing cases to the Pensions Ombudsman:
</p>

<p></p><ul><li>6 years from the date of the act that has given rise to your
    complaint/dispute </li>
  <li>3 years from the date that you became aware of or should have become
    aware of the Act </li>
</ul><p>The Pensions Ombudsman has discretion to consider a complaint or dispute
outside these timeframes but cannot go back further than 13 April 1996. The
Pensions Ombudsman can carry out an investigation if the act or event that gave
rise to the complaint or dispute took place between 13 April 1996 and 28 April
2003, even if more than 6 years have passed since the event. </p>

<h3>What to do if you have a complaint</h3>

<p>If you have a complaint or dispute, you should begin by trying to sort it
out at a local level with those responsible for the management of the pension
scheme or Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA). </p>

<p>Where the pension scheme or PRSA has an Internal Disputes Resolution (IDR)
procedure, the Pensions Ombudsman cannot as a rule investigate the complaint or
dispute unless and until the matter has gone through that procedure and the
trustees or managers have issued their notice of decision. </p>

<p>Under the Pensions Act, all pension schemes and PRSAs must operate an IDR
procedure. Parties are not bound by recommendations arising out of an IDR
procedure. </p>

<p>If the matter has not been resolved to your satisfaction having gone through
the IDR procedure, or if the procedure has not been completed within 3 months,
you can apply to the Pensions Ombudsman to investigate your complaint.</p>

<h3>How to make a complaint</h3>

<p>You should check that your complaint or dispute is one that the Pensions
Ombudsman can investigate and that you are eligible to complain. You should
then write to the Pensions Ombudsman explaining your complaint or dispute and
saying what you think the persons responsible for the management of the pension
scheme should do to put matters right. </p>

<p>There is a standard complaints form, approved by the Minister for Social
Protection, that you must use. This form is available from the Office of the
Pensions Ombudman or from the Pensions Authority. You can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.pensionsombudsman.ie/cms/index.php?q=forms">download the
form</a> here. </p>

<p>You should enclose all relevant documents and correspondence (copies will be
sufficient), including any correspondence with your pension scheme, employer or
administrator. </p>

<p>Complaints may be made by post. Complaints <span>cannot</span> be made by
telephone. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>In general, large employers in Ireland have occupational pension schemes,
but many smaller employers throughout the country do not.</p>

<p>Each pension scheme has its own set of rules. Pension schemes nationally are
generally regulated by the Pensions Authority. Members of schemes have certain
rights in respect of such matters as information. Contibutions to approved
occupational pension schemes may attract tax relief. Regulation for tax
purposes is supervised by the Retirement Benefits District of the Revenue
Commissioners. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>There is <span>no legal obligation</span> on employers to provide
occupational pension schemes for employees. However, more and more employers
are putting schemes in place and there is positive government encouragement to
do so.</p>

<h3>Occupational pensions and personal pensions</h3>

<p>Occupational pensions are organised by employers to provide pensions to one
or more employees on retirement or to surviving dependants on the death of an
employee. </p>

<p>A <a shape="rect" href="personal_pensions.html">personal pension scheme</a>
(properly known as a Retirement Annuity Contract- RAC) is an arrangement by a
self-employed person or an employee, generally a person who is not a member of
an occupational pension scheme, to provide a pension on retirement or to
surviving dependants on death. RACs are governed by tax legislation and
financial services legislation. They are not regulated by the Pensions
Authority.</p>

<p>You may be a member of an occupational pension scheme and also arrange a
personal pension. However, it may not be possible to avail of the tax benefits
in respect of both. You may not contribute to an occupational pension scheme
and a personal pension arrangement at the same time in relation to the same
employment. However, you may make a personal pension arrangement in respect of
earnings from another employment or from self-employment. </p>

<p>A person becoming an employee and joining an occupational pension scheme can
now continue to contribute to the RAC schemes where they join an occupational
pension scheme. However, tax relief will not be given to continued
contributions.</p>

<p>From 2003 onwards, <a shape="rect" href="personal_retirement_savings_accounts.html">Personal Retirement Savings
Accounts (PRSAs)</a> became available. These are designed to be used instead of
occupational pension schemes by employers who do not wish to sponsor such
schemes. They may also be used to supplement occupational scheme benefits, as
Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) and as a substitute for personal
pension schemes. Employers must offer access to at least one standard PRSA to
any employee who is not eligible to join an occupational pension scheme within
6 months of joining employment and must offer a PRSA for AVC purposes if there
is no facility for AVCs within the scheme. <a href="http://www.pensionsboard.ie/en/Publications/Information_Booklets/PRSAs_-_a_consumer_and_employers'_guide.pdf">Further
information on PRSAs (pdf)</a> is available from the Pension Authority's
website.</p>

<h3>Kinds of occupational pensions</h3>

<p>Occupational pension schemes may be contributory or non-contributory, funded
or unfunded, defined benefit or defined contribution. </p>

<p>In contributory schemes, both you and your employer pay contributions
towards the scheme. </p>

<p>In non-contributory schemes, you do not contribute but your employer
does.</p>

<h3>Funded schemes</h3>

<p>Virtually all occupational schemes are funded - the contributions are put
into a designated fund and the benefits are paid from that fund. The most
notable exception is the public service pension arrangement where there is no
fund and benefits are paid out of current government funds.</p>

<p>A National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) has been established to provide a
fund that can be drawn upon for future payments of public service and social
welfare pensions. This is different from funded pension schemes. In a funded
scheme, you are a member of the scheme and you have a direct interest in the
fund. You have no direct claim on the NPRF.</p>

<h3>Defined benefit schemes</h3>

<p>A defined benefit scheme is one where the benefit entitlement is defined in
some way by reference to your earnings, your length of service, an index or a
fixed amount. So, you know in advance that your pension will be, for example,
half of your final salary if you have 40 years service or that it will be a
certain amount each week. In defined benefit schemes, the contributions may
have to be varied from time to time in order to make sure that the fund can
meet the level of benefits. Some schemes have provisions for the employer to
top up the fund if necessary.</p>

<h4>Limit on overall value of fund</h4>

<p>The Finance Act 2006 introduced a limit on the value of an individual's
pension fund which may attract tax relief and this may vary from year to year.
This is called the Standard Fund Threshold. From 7 December 2010 to 31 December
2013 the maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes was
€2.3 million. If the fund is greater than the limit then tax at 41% will be
charged on the excess when it is drawn down from the fund. From 1 January 2014
the absolute value of the Standard Fund Threshold reduced to €2 million. From
the same date the value of a defined benefit differs depending on the age at
which the pension is drawn down. </p>

<h4>New rules on wind-up of defined benefit schemes</h4>

<p>From 25 December 2013 the rules about the distribution of assets in defined
benefit pension schemes which are being wound up changed. When a defined
benefit pension scheme is being wound up, its assets are distributed in a
specific order of priority. If the scheme is fully funded then all liabilities
are met. If the pension scheme is underfunded or insolvent, then people with a
lower order of priority do not get what they expected from the scheme. </p>

<p>The new rules which apply to the winding up of schemes after 25 December
2013 reduce the rights of current pensioners and improve the priority given to
future pensioners. These new rules differ depending on whether or not the
employer is solvent. </p>

<p><strong>Single insolvency order - If the employer is solvent</strong></p>

<p>This order applies to cases where the pension scheme is insolvent but the
employer is solvent. The first priority is additional voluntary contributions
and defined contribution benefits.</p>

<p>The second priority is the pensions payable to current pensioners but there
are now limits on the amounts to which priority is attached as follows:</p>
<ul><li>The first €12,000 annually of pension</li>
  <li>90% of pensions between €12,000 and €60,000 with a minimum of
    €12,000</li>
  <li>80% of pensions over €60,000 with a minimum of €54,000</li>
</ul><p>The next priority is 50% of the pensions of future pensioners. After that,
the priority is:</p>
<ul><li>The remaining pension of current pensioners</li>
  <li>Remaining pensions of future pensioners</li>
  <li>Any other remaining benefits</li>
</ul><p>This means that existing pensioners could have their current pensions
reduced. Pensions under €12,000 may not be reduced. The maximum reduction is
then 10% of pensions under €60,000 (but they cannot be reduced to less than
€12,000) and 20% of pensions over €60,000.</p>

<p><strong>Double insolvency order - Employer insolvent</strong></p>

<p>The priority in the winding up of a defined benefit pension scheme in cases
where the employer is insolvent is as follows:</p>
<ol><li>Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) and defined contribution
    benefits</li>
  <li>50% of current pensioner and future pensioner benefits</li>
  <li>Pensioner benefits up to €12,000 a year</li>
  <li>Remaining benefits for current pensioners</li>
  <li>Remaining benefits for future pensioners</li>
</ol><p>Where the scheme does not have enough funds to pay 50% of pensioner and
future pensioner benefits and pensioner benefits up to €12,000 a year, the
Minister for Finance must provide the necessary funding.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Defined contribution scheme</h3>

<p>A defined contribution scheme is one where the contribution is fixed by
agreement but the benefits are decided by reference to the value of the
contributions paid under the scheme and are not fixed in advance. So, you do
not know what level of pension you will get.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Occupational pensions and social welfare pensions</h3>

<p>Occupational and personal pensions operate independently of the social
welfare pension system (Social welfare pensions include <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/older_and_retired_people/state_pension_contributory.html">contributory</a>
and <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/older_and_retired_people/state_pension_non_contributory.html">non-contributory</a>
pensions) and there is no statutory link between the two. However, it is common
for occupational pensions to take into account the level of social welfare
pension received in calculating the level of benefit. For example, some schemes
provide for a benefit, which, together with the social welfare pension, will
give you a half or two-thirds of your final salary. This may be done when you
start to receive your pension but your occupational pension may not be
subsequently reduced because your social welfare pension is increased.</p>

<p>Such schemes are sometimes called integrated or co-ordinated schemes.</p>

<h3>Tax relief on pension contributions</h3>

<p>If you are a member of an approved pension scheme, you can get tax relief at
your highest rate on your contributions to the scheme. There are various rules
that pension schemes must meet in order to get the tax relief and there is a
limit to the amount of the relief. Since 1 January 2011 you pay <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/social_insurance_in_ireland.html">PRSI</a>
and the <a href="../../tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">Universal Social
Charge</a> on your pension contributions.</p>

<p>The maximum pension contributions, in any one year, for which you are
entitled to tax relief, is related to your age and is expressed as a percentage
of your gross income. The maximum gross income figure for relief purposes is
€115,000. The percentage relief limits are: </p>

self-employed, <em>earnings</em> means net relevant earnings, that is, earnings
less allowable expenses. </p>

<p>You pay tax on the pension when you receive it.</p>

<p><strong>Taxation of retirement lump sum</strong></p>

<p><strong></strong>Since 1 January 2011 there is a limit of €200,000 on the
amount of the tax-free retirement lump sum. Lump sum payments above that limit
will be taxed as follows (in 2014 and 2015): </p>

<table border="1" style="width: 100%"><col><col><tbody><tr><td><strong>Amount of lump sum</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Income tax rate</strong></td>
    </tr><tr><td>Up to €200,000</td>
      <td>0%</td>
    </tr><tr><td>€200,001 - €500,000</td>
      <td>20%</td>
    </tr><tr><td>Over €500,000</td>
      <td>Taxpayer's marginal rate</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><h4>Levy on private pension funds</h4>

<p>There is a levy of 0.6% on the market value of assets which are managed in
pension funds and pension plans approved under Irish tax legislation. (These
include occupational pension schemes, Retirement Annuity Contracts and Personal
Retirement Savings Accounts). This levy applied until the end of 2014. In 2014
an extra levy of 0.15% was introduced. This meant that the total pension levy
in 2014 is 0.75% and the levy in 2015 was 0.15%. It was announced in Budget
2016 that this levy will be abolished. </p>

<h3>The Pensions Authority</h3>

<p>The Pensions Authority is the regulatory body for occupational pensions. </p>

<p>The Authority consists of representatives nominated by trade unions,
employers, the Government, the pensions industry and professional groups
involved with occupational pension schemes. </p>

<p>The main functions of the Authority are:</p>
<ul><li>To monitor and supervise the operation of the Pensions Act and pension
    developments generally; </li>
  <li>To issue guidelines on the duties and responsibilities of pension scheme
    trustees and Codes of Practice on specific aspects of their responsibility;
  </li>
  <li>To encourage the provision of appropriate training for trustees </li>
  <li>To advise the Minister on standards for trustees; </li>
  <li>To investigate complaints concerning possible non-compliance with the
    pensions legislation and to resolve disputes that may arise in relation to
    some aspects of the legislation and </li>
  <li>To advise the Minister for Social Protection on pensions matters
    generally. </li>
</ul><p>Occupational pension schemes are obliged to register with the Authority. </p>

<h3>Ombudsman for Pensions</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="ombudsman_for_pensions.html">Ombudsman for
Pensions</a> has the power to investigate and determine your complaints
concerning disputes of fact or law and errors in relation to occupational
pension schemes and PRSAs. The Ombudsman has the power to give any directions
necessary to resolve the complaint or dispute and can give financial
compensation (redress) but this cannot exceed the actual loss of benefit under
the occupational pension scheme or PRSA. The Ombudsman does not have the power
to award legal costs. All decisions made by the Ombudsman are binding between
the parties subject to a right of appeal by either party to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/high_court.html">High Court</a></p>

<h3>Your rights as a pension scheme member</h3>

<p>The Pensions Authority has produced a number of leaflets on the operation of
the Pensions Act. It provides information to members of pension schemes about
their rights under the legislation. If you have a complaint, the Authority will
advise you about your rights. </p>

<p>If necessary, the Authority has extensive powers to inspect the scheme's
books and records, to enter premises and to require people to give
explanations. It may apply to the High Court to have pension scheme trustees
replaced in order to protect the interests of the members.</p>

<p>Among the more important rights you have as a member of a pension scheme
are:</p>

<p><strong>The right to information</strong></p>

<p>The trustees of the scheme must provide information to members, prospective
members, their spouses, people entitled or prospectively entitled to benefits
under the scheme and to representatives of trade unions. </p>

<p>You are entitled to get information about the scheme, about how it is
administered, what rights you have and what obligations you have. The trustees
are obliged to tell you if more than 5% of the scheme's assets are invested in
the employer's business or in any one investment.</p>

<p><strong>The right to be involved in the scheme</strong></p>

<p>In certain cases, you are entitled to be involved in the selection of
trustees. This is the case if your scheme has 50 or more qualified members or
12 or more qualified members of a directly invested scheme. A qualified member
is a member of the scheme currently in employment or a pensioner, but does not
include a member who is covered only for death in service or a non-member (e.g.
a dependant) who is receiving benefits from the scheme. </p>

<p>Members can elect half the total number of trustees (excluding the
chairperson), subject to a minimum of two.</p>

<h3>Rules about pension schemes</h3>

<p>Pension schemes can, to a considerable extent, set their own rules about
contributions and benefits. There are some rules set out in legislation to
which <span>they must adhere.</span> </p>

<h3>Preservation and Transfer of Benefits</h3>

<p>There are specific rules about what happens if you leave the pension scheme
for whatever reason, for example, if you change jobs or you become
self-employed or retire early without a pension. Your benefits from the pension
scheme may be preserved within the scheme or transferred to another scheme. If
you have at least 2 years service, you are entitled to a preserved benefit if
you leave before the normal retirement age. A preserved benefit means that you
get a pension when you reach the scheme's normal retirement age. (Prior to 2
June 2002, 5 years service was needed to qualify for preservation). </p>

<p>Alternatively, you can ask the trustees to transfer your pension rights to a
new pension scheme.</p>

<p>You can find out more about the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.pensionsboard.ie/en/LifeCycle/Benefits_payable_on_leaving/">preservation
and transfer of benefits.</a></p>

<h3>Funding standards</h3>

<p>The trustees are obliged to meet the minimum standards of funding for funded
occupational schemes. </p>

<h3>Providing for dependants</h3>

<p>Pension schemes usually have benefits for you when you retire and for your
widowed spouse and dependent children after your death. Not all schemes have
arrangements for dependants. </p>

<p>Under an occupational pension scheme, the maximum benefit that can be
provided for a spouse or dependent has been increased from 2/3 of the full
pension to 100% of the provision.</p>

<p>Some schemes may allow you to designate the person who should benefit under
the scheme so it is possible, in some cases, to nominate a person other than a
spouse. </p>

<h3>Occupational pensions and marriage breakdown</h3>

<p>In judicial separation and divorce proceedings, the court may make various
types of financial settlements. Among these is a Pension Adjustment Order.</p>

<p>The Pension Adjustment Order designates a part of the pension for payment to
a spouse (usually the wife) and dependant children. The judge decides how much
of the pension should be designated. The effect of such an order is that the
designated part of the pension remains in the pension scheme but is payable to
your spouse and children when you reach pension age or die.</p>

<p>Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (<acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Accounts">PRSA</acronym>s) were first
introduced in Ireland through the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2002/a1802.pdf">Pensions
(Amendment) Act 2002</a>. A Personal Retirement Savings Account is a long-term
personal retirement account designed to enable you to save for retirement in a
flexible manner. (This is especially important for people with no pension
provision). Your <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Accounts">PRSA</acronym> is a contract
between you and a <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Accounts">PRSA</acronym> provider in the
form of an investment account. <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Accounts">PRSA</acronym>s allow you to
change employment and continue to use the same PRSA. You can also switch from
one <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Accounts">PRSA</acronym> to
another at any time, free of charge. </p>

<p>Tax relief based on your age will be given by the Government for the
contributions you pay into your <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Accounts">PRSA</acronym>. Since 2003
employers that do not provide an <a shape="rect" href="occupational_pensions.html">occupational pension scheme</a> for their
employees are obliged to provide access to at least one Standard <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Accounts">PRSA</acronym>. Employers are
required to have provided access to a <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Accounts">PRSA</acronym> to employees who
are not entitled to join a pension scheme within 6 months of existing service.
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.pensionsauthority.ie/en/Employers/Pension_guides/Personal_Retirement_Savings_Accounts.pdf">Read
more about employers' obligations and PRSAs here (pdf)</a> </p>

<p>There are two types of <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Accounts">PRSA</acronym>: </p>
<ul><li>Standard <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym> and </li>
  <li>Non-Standard <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym>. </li>
</ul><p>The main difference between the two is that the maximum charges under a
Standard <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym>
cannot exceed 5% of contributions paid and 1% per annum of the <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym> assets. There are
some restrictions on the kind of assets a standard <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym> can invest in. You
can read more about the differences between Standard and Non-Standard <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym>s in a <a href="http://www.pensionsauthority.ie/en/Employers/Pension_guides/Personal_Retirement_Savings_Accounts.pdf">Consumer's
Guide to PRSAs (pdf)</a> produced by the Pensions Authority. </p>

<p>Standard <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym>s are likely to meet
the requirements of most people. The level of charges imposed is very
important; the charges imposed reduce the fund you can build up. On your
retirement, the size of your fund will depend on your contributions and the
investment performance less charges deducted. It is not possible to predict
investment performance. Charges on non-Standard <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSAs</acronym> are not capped and
in most cases, are higher than Standard <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym>s. If you are
considering a Non-Standard <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym>, <span>ask for a
full explanation of the differences between this product and the Standard
product.</span> You <span>should beware of promises of better returns on
Non-Standard PRSA products</span> - predicting investment performance is
extremely difficult. </p>

<h3>Do you need a PRSA?</h3>

<p>If you are considering whether to invest in a <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym> or are weighing up
your options, you should ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul><li><span>Is there an existing pension scheme available to me in my
    job?</span> If not, you should consider making provision for your
    retirement and a <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym> may be the
    option for you. If you already have a good pension arrangement, you may not
    need to make any additional provision, or you may be able to "top up" your
    benefits through making Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs). If there
    is no <acronym title="Additional Voluntary Contribution">AVC</acronym>
    facility, your employer must provide access to a <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym>. </li>
  <li><span>Should I start a PRSA if I already have a personal pension plan?
    </span>You should seek professional advice based on your circumstances.
    Contact a broker or your pension provider for more information. </li>
  <li><span>Do I need a PRSA if I already have a defined benefit scheme?</span>
    Defined benefit pension schemes promise a pension related to your salary
    (e.g. two-thirds of final salary on retirement). You may not need to make
    any further pension provisions. Transferring from a defined benefit scheme
    into a PRSA involves a risk. Assess your financial position and weight up
    the advantages/disadvantages. </li>
  <li><span>Do I need a PRSA if I have a defined contribution scheme?</span>
    You are already carrying the investment risk - your pension will depend on
    the contributions you make, together with the investment performance of
    your fund, less charges involved. If your employer is making a contribution
    to your existing scheme, you should find out whether this will continue if
    you transfer to a PRSA. </li>
</ul><h3>Investment of your money</h3>

<p>Standard <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym>s invest only in
pooled funds where the risk is spread across a large number and variety of
investments. Non-Standard <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym>s can offer wider
investment choices. However, you need to be sure that you understand the
investment choices and the reasons why you should opt for them. If you do not
understand how your pension will be invested, then you should consider if this
product is best for you. </p>

<p>You should also be sure that you can afford the monthly payment suggested
and that this is the most effective payment for tax relief purposes - read more
about tax relief and <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym>s below. </p>

<h3>Approval of PRSA products</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://www.pensionsboard.ie">Pensions
Authority</a> and the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie">Revenue
Commissioners</a> are jointly responsible in Ireland for approving <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym> products. The
Pensions Authority supervises the activities of providers in relation to their
approved products and monitors compliance with the legislation regarding
<acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym>s. As part
of the Pension Authority's role, a register of <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym> providers and their
products is available. </p>

<h3>Ombudsman for Pensions</h3>

<p>The <a shape="rect" href="ombudsman_for_pensions.html">Ombudsman for
Pensions</a> has the power to investigate and determine your complaints
concerning disputes of fact or law and errors in relation to occupational
pension schemes and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts. The Ombudsman has the
power to give any directions necessary to resolve the complaint or dispute and
can give financial compensation (redress) but this cannot exceed the actual
loss of benefit under the occupational pension scheme or Personal Retirement
Savings Account. The Ombudsman does not have the power to award legal costs.
All decisions made by the Ombudsman are binding between the parties subject to
a right of appeal by either party to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/justice/courts_system/high_court.html">High Court</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Tax relief and PRSAs</h3>

<p>If you pay a contribution into a <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym>, you will benefit
from tax relief at your marginal income tax rate. Since 1 January 2011 you have
to pay social insurance (PRSI) contributions and the <a href="../../tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">Universal Social
Charge</a> on your PRSA contribution. Where your contribution to your PRSA is
deducted from your salary by your employer, net pay arrangements will apply,
that is, your tax relief is given at the time you pay the contribution. </p>

<p>Maximum annual tax deductible is based on a percentage of your earnings. The
allowable percentage rises with age. (So for example, someone over 40 years of
age will obtain a higher rate of tax relief than someone aged under 30 years).
</p>

<p>Tax relief is allowed against your relevant earnings (that is, earnings from
employment, from a profession, from a trade or from an office). If you have
earnings as a proprietary directory or employee of an investment company, these
are discounted. "Net relevant earnings" are relevant earnings less losses,
capital allowances and certain payments that reduce a person's income for tax
purposes such as tax effective covenants. </p>

<p>If you are a member of an occupational pension scheme or of a statutory
pension scheme, you may pay to an Additional Voluntary Contributions <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym>. (Separate rules
apply here - see <acronym title="Additional Voluntary Contribution">AVC</acronym> below). </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p><acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym>
providers cannot impose a <span>minimum</span> contribution greater than the
following:</p>
<ul><li>€300 per annum </li>
  <li>€10 per electric transaction or </li>
  <li>€50 per transaction for other methods of payment. </li>
</ul><p>Contributions received by <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym> providers must be
held in a custodian account. </p>

<p>Maximum allowable contributions for tax relief purposes are as follows: </p>

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Age</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Percentage (%) of earnings*</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Under 30 years</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">15%</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">30-39 years</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20%</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">40-49 years</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">25%</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">50-54 years</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">30%</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">55-59 years</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">35%</td>
    </tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">60 and over</td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">40%</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p>*In the case of employees, "earnings" means gross pay for tax purposes. In
the case of self-employed people, "earnings" is defined as "net relevant
earnings" (see above). From 2011 the annual earnings limit that may be taken
into account is €115,000 (€150,000 in 2010).</p>

<p>This means for example, that someone aged 35 years can gain tax relief on
the lower of 20% of their earnings or on the contributions paid in that year.
</p>

<p>Contributions made by an employer to a <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym> on behalf of an
employee, are treated as a <a shape="rect" href="../../tax/income_tax/taxation_of_benefits_from_employment.html">"benefit
in kind"</a> of the employee. These contributions are treated for relief
purposes for the employer as they are for the employee. For example, an
employee aged 29 contributes 5% of their earnings to a <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym> and the employer
contributes a further 10%, the employee as treated as making a total
contribution of 15%. The employee is charged on the employer's contribution as
a benefit in kind and must include this on their return of income to the
Revenue Commissioners. This tax treatment makes no practical difference unless
the total contribution limits shown are exceeded. </p>

<p><span>From April 2006</span> contributions to PRSAs have been disregarded
from assessment in <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/means_test_for_social_welfare_payments/means_test.html">means-tested
social welfare schemes</a> except Supplementary Welfare Schemes.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If your employer does not operate an occupational pension scheme or where
there are certain restrictions applying to the occupational pension scheme,
your employer is required by law to ensure they provide access to at least one
Standard <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym>.
This rule applies to all employers, irrespective of the number of employees and
the status of those employees (i.e., whether they are full-time, fixed-term,
part-time, contract, etc.). </p>

<p>Contact the HR manager or Payroll Section at your employment to find out
about more about the Standard <acronym title="Personal Retirement Savings Account">PRSA</acronym>(s) they have
provided. </p>

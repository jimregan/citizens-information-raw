<p>Financial institutions such as banks, credit unions and building societies
provide a range of accounts. There are generally 2 main categories of account;
a current account and a deposit account: </p>
<ul><li>A current account allows you to make day-to-day transactions (for
    example, paying a bill or getting your salary paid directly to the
    account). These are offered only by banks and building societies </li>
  <li>A deposit account allows you to build up savings and you may earn
    interest on this money. These are offered by most financial
  institutions.</li>
</ul><p>Some accounts offer you free services, but this depends on the type of
account you have. For example, with some banks, you may have to keep an amount
of money in your account at all times.</p>

<p>If you earn interest on savings then you may have to pay a tax on the
interest called <a href="../../tax/tax_on_savings_and_investments/deposit_interest_retention_tax.html">Deposit
Interest Retention Tax (DIRT)</a>.</p>

<p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has a useful tool which
<a href="http://www.nca.ie/compare">compares the costs and benefits of various
financial products</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Opening a bank account</h3>

<p>When you open a current account you should be aware of the services the
account offers. You should also find out what the fees and charges for the
account are. You can get more detailed information on what to ask about when
deciding on <a href="http://www.nca.ie/nca/current-accounts">a current account
from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission</a> – see 'Where to
apply' below. </p>

<p>When you open a deposit account you should know what rate of interest you
may earn on your savings. You should also find out how you can access your
money should you need it. A deposit account is not your only option – you can
save money in other ways, for example, through An Post.</p>

<p>A financial institution must <a href="financial_institutions_and_identification.html">establish your
identity and verify your address</a> before you can open a bank account.</p>

<h3>Switching your account</h3>

<p>You may want to switch your account to another financial institution
because:</p>
<ul><li>Your circumstances may have changed and you may have different needs from
    an account</li>
  <li>You may have found an account that offers you a better deal</li>
  <li>You may be unhappy with the level of service that your bank is
  providing</li>
  <li>You may be unhappy with the fees your bank is charging</li>
</ul><p>If you decide to switch your account you can get information to help you
decide and there are rules governing the process. </p>

<p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has <a href="http://compare.nca.ie/CurrentAccount">a personal current account cost
comparison</a> that may help you to see whether you can get a better deal from
another financial institution. </p>

<p>If you decide to switch your account, the Central Bank has issued a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/processes/consumer-protection-code/documents/code%20of%20conduct%20on%20the%20switching%20of%20current%20accounts%20with%20credit%20institutions%201%20october%202010.pdf">code
of conduct on the switching of current accounts with credit institutions
(pdf)</a>. All credit institutions (banks and building societies) in Ireland
must comply with the code.</p>

<p>Under the code all banks and building societies must provide a switching
pack to their customers. This contains a description of all of the current
accounts currently being offered to new customers, as well as a step-by-step
guide to what you need to do when switching.</p>

<p>Your new bank or building society must have your new account up and running
within 10 working days of the <em>switching date</em> - this is the date agreed
between you and your new bank or building society for the process to start. You
will be given the option to keep your old account, or to close it. You must let
your new bank know before you switch.</p>

<p>If you keep your old account open you may have to pay charges on this
account and stamp duty on your cards, even if you no longer use that
account.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>A <em>dormant account</em> is an account that has had no customer-initiated
transactions for 15 years. Life assurance policies with a specified term are
considered dormant 5 years after the end of that term.</p>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2001/act/32/enacted/en/html">Dormant
Accounts Acts 2001–2012</a> and the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0002/index.html">Unclaimed
Life Assurance Policies Act 2003</a>, balances on dormant accounts with banks,
building societies and An Post, as well as the net encashment value of certain
life assurance policies are paid into the Dormant Accounts Fund. This fund is
managed by the <a href="http://www.ntma.ie/">National Treasury Management
Agency (NTMA)</a>.</p>

<p>Financial institutions must contact you if you have not carried out a
transaction on your account in 15 years or more. If the institution cannot
contact you, the money in the account will be transferred to the Dormant
Accounts Fund. The rights of original account holders (or their heirs) are not
affected by the transfer to the Fund and they can always reclaim the money
(including interest) - see 'How to apply' below for information on how to
reclaim funds.</p>

<p>If someone dies without <a href="../../../death/before_a_death/making_a_will.html">making a will</a>
and their relatives cannot be found, the State is the ultimate beneficiary of
their estate. The proceeds of sale of property and any other assets are placed
in an Intestate Estates Fund Deposit Account, which may also be paid into the
Dormant Accounts Fund.</p>

<h3>What kind of dormant accounts are covered by the Acts?</h3>

<p>The Acts apply to a deposit, share or current account in a bank or building
society; an account, saving certificate, savings bond or instalment saving
scheme with An Post; and certain life assurance policies. The legislation does
not apply to accounts held in <a href="credit_unions.html">credit
unions</a>.</p>

<h3>What is the dormancy period?</h3>

<p>The dormancy period means a period of 15 years from 30 September of each
year. An account is designated dormant when on 30 September there have been no
transactions by the account holder in the previous 15 years. </p>

<p>Institutions must write to all customers identified as being holders of
dormant accounts (unless there is under €100 in the account or the person has
instructed the institution not to send correspondence or correspondence to the
last address has been returned). If an account has been designated as being a
dormant account– the account holder has until 31 March of the following year
to reactivate the account by contacting their institution and carrying out a
transaction on the account. After 31 March of the following year, the funds are
transferred to the Dormant Accounts Fund. Even if the funds or property have
been transferred to the Dormant Accounts Fund, you or your next of kin still
have a claim on your funds or property.</p>

<h2>Dormant accounts disbursement schemes</h2>

<p>While the legislation guarantees the right of account holders to reclaim
funds at any time, it also provides for disbursement of funds that are not
likely to be reclaimed.</p>

<p>Allocations from the Dormant Accounts Fund are focussed on programmes or
projects that support the following objectives and groups:</p>
<ul><li>The personal and social development of people who are economically or
    socially disadvantaged</li>
  <li>The educational development of people who are educationally
  disadvantaged,</li>
  <li>People with a disability (within the meaning of the Equal Status
  Acts)</li>
</ul><p>You can get further information on dormant accounts disbursement schemes
from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs or
Pobal – see 'Where to apply' below.<br></p>

<p>If you have been notified by your credit institution, or if you have reason
to believe that you have dormant funds in a branch of a credit institution, you
should complete the Dormant Account Claim Form and send it directly to the
credit institution concerned. The Dormant Account Claim Form is in the Banking
and Payments Federation Ireland booklet, <a href="http://www.bpfi.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/A-Guide-to-Dormant-Accounts-Oct-2014-Web-Final.pdf">A
Guide to Dormant Accounts (pdf)</a>, which is available in credit
institutions.</p>

<p>If the credit institution no longer exists, you can find <a href="http://www.bpfi.ie/customer-assist/personal-customers/dormant-accounts/">information
on dormant accounts</a> on the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland website,
bpfi.ie.</p>

<p>You should send the completed Dormant Account Claim Form directly to the
credit institution concerned.</p>

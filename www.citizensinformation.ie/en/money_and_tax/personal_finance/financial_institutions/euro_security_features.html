<p>The Central Bank of Ireland is responsible for providing euro banknotes and
coins to strict quality standards that have been established for the
Eurosystem.</p>

<p>This document looks at the security features of euro bank notes and coins
and what to do if you suspect a counterfeit.</p>

<p>The Central Bank website also has answers to <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/paycurr/notescoin/Pages/FrequentlyAskedQuestions.aspx">frequently
asked questions about using the euro in Ireland</a>. </p>

<h2>Banknotes</h2>

<p>There are 7 different euro banknotes: €500, €200, €100, €50, €20,
€10 and €5. All euro banknotes include some high-tech security features. If
you are not sure whether a bank note is genuine you should always check several
features. If in doubt, compare the banknote with one you know to be genuine.</p>

<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) suggests that you carry out 3 checks on euro
bank notes:</p>

<h3>Feel</h3>

<p><strong>Paper:</strong> All euro banknotes are printed on pure cotton paper
which feels crisp and firm (not limp or waxy).</p>

<p><strong>Raised print:</strong> Special printing makes the ink feel raised or
thicker in the main image, the lettering and the value numerals on the front of
the banknotes. To feel the raised print, run your finger over it or scratch it
gently with your fingernail.</p>

<p>Additional tactile marks for the visually impaired are included on the
bottom edge of the €200 banknote and on the right-hand edge of the €500.</p>

<h3>Look</h3>

<p><strong>Watermarks:</strong> All euro banknotes contain a watermark that is
visible when held up to the light. This watermark shows a picture and displays
the value of the banknote.</p>

<p><strong>Security thread:</strong> The security thread is embedded in the
banknote paper. If you hold the banknote against the light, the thread will
appear as a dark stripe. The word "EURO" and the value can be seen in tiny
letters on the stripe.</p>

<p><strong>Perforations:</strong> Hold the banknote against the light. In the
hologram you will see perforations which form the € symbol. You can also see
small numbers showing the value.</p>

<h3>Tilt</h3>

<p><strong>Holograms and colour-changing numbers:</strong> Low value notes (5,
10 and 20 euro) have a hologram foil stripe on the front. Higher value notes
(50, 100, 200 and 500 euro) have a hologram patch on the front and a colour
changing number on the back.</p>

<p>When you tilt a low value note, the euro symbol and the value of the
banknote appear and a glossy stripe on the back. When the banknote is tilted
under a bright light, the stripe shines and slightly changes colour.</p>

<p>When you tilt the front of a high value note an image of the architectural
motif and the value of the banknote appear. When you tilt the back of the
banknote, the value numerals change colour from purple to olive green or
brown</p>

<h3>Additional security features</h3>

<p><strong>Microprinting:</strong> On some areas of the banknote you can see
tiny writing, for example, inside the "EYPΩ" (EURO in Greek characters) on the
front. You will need a magnifying glass to see it. The microprinting is sharp
(not blurred).</p>

<p><strong>Check with an ultraviolet lamp:</strong> Under UV light</p>
<ul><li>The paper itself does not glow.</li>
  <li>Fibres embedded in the paper appear, coloured red, blue and green.</li>
  <li>The flag of the European Union looks green and has orange stars.</li>
  <li>The signature of the ECB President turns green.</li>
  <li>The large stars and small circles on the front glow. The map, bridge and
    value numeral on the back appear in yellow.</li>
</ul><p>You can view <a href="http://www.ecb.int/euro/banknotes/security/html/index.en.html">images of
genuine bank notes and explore interactive displays of security features on the
European Central Bank website</a>.</p>

<h2>Coins</h2>

<p>There are 8 different euro coins (1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 cent or 1, 2 euro
coins). One euro is divided into 100 cent. The coins vary in size, colour and
thickness according to their values.</p>

<p>All euro bank notes look exactly the same, however, while all euro coins
have a common 'European' side, they also have a 'national' side. The European
side features designs common to all euro countries showing different maps of
Europe, surrounded by the 12 stars of the European Union. <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/cash/national/index_en.htm">The
reverse side of each coin shows an individual design relating to each member
state</a>. The Irish national side depicts the harp. All euro coins are legal
tender throughout the euro area, irrespective of which national side the coins
have.</p>

<p>The edge of each coin has been milled (specially marked), which makes it
easier to recognise different values. This is very important for people with
visual impairments. Special bi-metal technology is incorporated into the larger
1 and 2 euro coins to prevent counterfeiting.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ecb.int/euro/coins/html/index.en.html">The ECB</a> and
the <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/paycurr/notescoin/coin/Pages/default.aspx">Central
Bank website have more information about euro coins</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l47f63">Counterfeit notes and coins</h2>

<p>It is a criminal offence to keep or pass on a banknote which you believe or
know is a counterfeit. You should check your change regularly for suspect notes
and coins.</p>

<h3>What should I do if I suspect a bank note or coin is counterfeit?</h3>

<p>If you believe you are in possession of a counterfeit you must submit it to
your local financial institution (for example, your bank), the Gardaí, or the
Central Bank National Analysis Centre/Coin National Analysis Centre (NAC/CNAC)
(see address below). Please include your details along with details of the
suspect counterfeit and any details of the source of the banknote or coin.</p>

<p>Financial institutions are obliged by law to retain suspect counterfeit
notes or coin and submit them to the Central Bank NAC/CNAC. You can also
contact <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/pages/contact.aspx?DeptID=40">the
National Analysis Centre online</a>.</p>

<p>If you submit a suspect note or coin to your local financial institution you
should get a receipt to confirm your submission as no refund will be given at
this time. If the banknote or coin is deemed genuine you will be given the
value of the note (through your bank). If you send suspect notes or coins to
NAC or CNAC you will be sent a letter acknowledging the submission and if
deemed genuine a replacement will be sent to you by post. </p>

<p>However if the banknotes or coins are counterfeit you will get no refund.
</p>

<h3>What should I do at work if I am given a banknote I suspect to be fake?</h3>

<p>The ECB recommends the following steps for people working in shops or places
that deal with cash:</p>
<ul><li>Do not get into an argument with the customer</li>
  <li>Tell him/her that you need to speak briefly to your supervisor or a
    security officer, but ensure that the customer can always see the banknote,
    to avoid any complaints</li>
  <li>Get your supervisor or the security officer to speak to the customer</li>
  <li>Make a mental note of the customer’s appearance</li>
  <li>If at all possible, do not return the banknote to the customer</li>
  <li>If he/she leaves by car, make a note of his/her number plate and the
  car</li>
  <li>Contact the police</li>
  <li>Hand over the suspect banknote without delay to your supervisor or
    security officer for forwarding to the police</li>
  <li>Do not try to be a hero – make sure you are safe at all times</li>
  <li>Since counterfeit banknotes are completely worthless, be vigilant</li>

<p>Money laundering is the processing of criminal proceeds (cash and assets
obtained from criminal activities) to disguise their illegal origin. It is a
world-wide problem and governments have been taking major steps in recent years
to combat it.</p>

<p>Money laundering has been treated as a very serious offence since the
passing of the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0015/index.html">Criminal
Justice Act in 1994.</a> The <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/en_act_2010_0006.htm">Criminal
Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Acts 2010 and 2013</a>
update Irish anti-money laundering and terrorist financing legislation and
brings it in line with the requirements of the third EU Anti-Money Laundering
Directive (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=cellar:3aa3f6e7-74dd-4a02-84c7-d3af2531e10b">2005/60/EC</a>).
Ireland will be required to transpose the fourth EU Anti-Money Laundering
Directive (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32015L0849">2015/849/EU</a>)
into Irish law.</p>

<p>Ireland is also obliged to implement certain recommendations of the <a href="http://www.fatf-gafi.org/">Financial Action Task Force (FATF)</a> the
international anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing body.<br></p>

<h3>What is a money laundering offence?</h3>

<p>Section 7 of the Act defines a <em>money laundering offence</em> in terms of
property that is the "proceeds of criminal conduct".</p>

<p>Money laundering offences are committed where a person knows or believes (or
is reckless as to whether or not) that the property represents the proceeds of
criminal conduct and the person is involved in:</p>
<ul><li>Concealing or disguising the true nature, source, location, disposition,
    movement or ownership of the property</li>
  <li>Converting, transferring, handling, acquiring, possessing or using the
    property or</li>
  <li>Removing the property from, or bringing the property into, the State</li>
</ul><h3>What is a “designated person”?</h3>

<p>The Act places obligations on <em>designated persons</em> to guard against
their businesses being used for money laundering or terrorist financing
purposes.</p>

<p>Section 25 of the Act defines the term ‘‘designated person’’ as any
person working in Ireland in any of the following capacities:</p>
<ul><li>A credit or a financial institution (this includes funds and fund service
    providers, money lenders and money transmission or bureaux de change
    businesses) unless specifically excepted</li>
  <li>An auditor, external accountant or tax adviser</li>
  <li>A relevant independent legal professional</li>
  <li>A trust or company service provider</li>
  <li>A property service provider</li>
  <li>A casino*</li>
  <li>A person who directs a private members club at which gambling activities
    are carried out</li>
  <li>A person trading in goods in respect of transactions involving the
    receipt of cash of at least €15,000</li>
  <li>Any other person of a prescribed class</li>
</ul><p>*Casinos are currently illegal in Ireland but they have been included on the
list above as a result of judgements of the European Court. These judgements
found that even though casinos are illegal in Ireland, EU member states must
still ensure all provisions of the money laundering directive are set down in
national law.</p>

<p>The Act also establishes a number of <em>competent authorities</em> who
monitor designated persons and secure compliance with the requirements of the
Act.</p>
<ul><li>The <a href="central_bank_and_financial_services_authority_of_ireland.html">Central
    Bank of Ireland</a> for credit institutions or financial institutions</li>
  <li>The designated accountancy bodies for auditors, external accountants or
    tax advisers</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.lawsociety.ie/">Law Society of Ireland</a> for
    solicitors</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.lawlibrary.ie/">General Council of the Bar of
    Ireland</a> for barristers</li>
  <li>The Minister for Justice and Equality for any other designated person
    (administered by the Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Unit – see
  below)</li>
</ul><h3>What are the obligations of designated persons?</h3>

<p>Designated persons must:</p>
<ul><li>Apply <em>customer due diligence</em> (for example, identify customers or
    beneficial owners),</li>
  <li>Report suspicious transactions to An Garda Síochána and Revenue and</li>
  <li>Have specific procedures in place to prevent money laundering and
    terrorist financing</li>
</ul><p>Customer due diligence obligations are designed to make it more difficult
for businesses to be used by for criminal money laundering or terrorist
financing.</p>

<p>The legislation on money laundering requires that <a href="opening_and_switching_a_bank_account.html">if you open a bank
account</a> you will need to provide proof of your identity. You may also be
asked other questions, for example, about the origin of funds and the nature of
your business. You can visit the <a href="http://www.nca.ie/nca/opening-an-account">Competition and Consumer
Protection Commission's website for more information on opening a bank account
in Ireland</a>.</p>

<h3>Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Unit</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.amlcu.gov.ie/">The Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Unit
(AMLCU)</a> has been established within the Department of Justice and Equality.
The AMCLU administers and monitors designated persons that are assigned by the
Act to the Minister for Justice and Equality. These include:</p>
<ul><li>Auditors, external accountants, and tax advisers who are not already
    supervised by a designated accountancy body, the Law Society of Ireland or
    the General Council of the Bar of Ireland</li>
  <li>Trust or company service providers (if the person is a member of a
    designated accountancy body, the designated accountancy body will be the
    competent authority)</li>
  <li>Private members' gaming clubs (a person who effectively directs a private
    members’ club at which gambling activities are carried on, but only in
    respect of those gambling activities)</li>
  <li>Any business trading in goods where cash payments of €15,000 are
    accepted. This sector is diverse and covers businesses from antique
    dealers, boat and car sales to dealers in precious stones and
  jewellers.</li>
</ul><p>Monitoring involves inspections of designated persons to ensure that they
are meeting their requirements under the Act. These inspections are undertaken
by authorised officers appointed by the Minister.</p>

<h3>Penalties</h3>

<p>A conviction on charges of money laundering carries a maximum penalty of 14
years imprisonment.</p>

<p>It is also an offence for a person to provide advice or assistance to anyone
engaged in money laundering.</p>

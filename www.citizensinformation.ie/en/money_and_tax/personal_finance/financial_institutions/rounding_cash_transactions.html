<p>Rounding was rolled out <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/press-area/press-releases/Pages/CentralBankannouncesrolloutofroundingof1cand2ccoinsnationally.aspx">nationwide
from Wednesday 28 October 2015</a>. Rounding means that the total amount of a
bill will be rounded up or down to the nearest 5 cent. It applies only to cash
payments and does not apply to bills paid electronically - by debit card,
credit card or by store card.</p>

<p>Rounding aims to reduce the use of 1 and 2 cent coins. These coins are not
actively used by consumers and the cost of issuing them is more than the value
of the coins. A 1 cent coin costs 1.65c to produce while 2 cent coin costs
1.94c. However 1 and 2 cent coins will continue to be legal tender.</p>

<p>The key features of rounding are:</p>
<ul><li>Rounding is voluntary for retailers and customers</li>
  <li>1c and 2c coins remain legal tender</li>
  <li>Rounding applies only to cash payments</li>
  <li>The total amount of any bill will be rounded down or up to the nearest 5
    cent</li>
</ul><p>The retailer can apply rounding automatically without asking the customer
– it is up to you to say if you don’t want rounding applied to your bill.
However customers must always be given exact change if they request it.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>Where a total bill is being paid in cash and the number of cent to be paid
does not end in zero or five - requiring the customer to use 1 and 2 cent coins
in payment or the retailer to use such coins in giving change - the amount of
change paid will be rounded to the nearest 5 or 10 cent:</p>
<ul><li>1 and 2 would be rounded down to zero</li>
  <li>3 and 4 would be rounded up to 5</li>
  <li>6 and 7 would be rounded down to 5</li>
  <li>8 and 9 would be rounded up to 10</li>
</ul><h3>Examples</h3>

<p>Under rounding a bill can be rounded up or down, as follows:</p>
<ol><li>A transaction costing €10.21 or €10.22 would be rounded to
  €10.20</li>
  <li>A transaction costing €10.23 or €10.24 would be rounded to
  €10.25</li>
  <li>A transaction costing €10.26 or €10.27 would be rounded to
  €10.25</li>
  <li>A transaction costing €10.28 or €10.29 would be rounded to
  €10.30</li>
</ol><p>Two individual items priced at €10.99 and €3.49 respectively will remain
at these prices, though the total bill (€14.48) would be rounded up to
€14.50.</p>

<p>Three individual items priced at €2.99, €4.49 and €8.17 respectively
will remain at these prices, though the total bill (€15.61) would be rounded
down to €15.60.</p>

<h3>Informing customers about rounding</h3>

<p>Shops and other retailers should tell you that they are using rounding
through appropriate in-store signage. This could include, for example, a notice
on entrance doors or at the till. The Central Bank will supply suitable signage
to retailers, free of charge, before the rollout on 28 October.</p>

<p>If you have a complaint or comment about how rounding is being implemented
you can email or write to the Central Bank at the address below.</p>

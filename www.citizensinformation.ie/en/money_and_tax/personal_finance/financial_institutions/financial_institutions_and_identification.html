<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Before you open an account with a financial institution, they are obliged to
establish your identity and verify your address. This requirement is set down
in <a href="money_laundering_in_ireland.html">anti-money laundering
legislation</a>. Financial institutions include banks, building societies and
credit unions. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>When you are opening an account you cannot use the same document as proof of
both your identity and your address. The requirements set out here are minimum
requirements and the bank can look for further information. </p>

<h4>Proof of identity</h4>

<p>You can prove your identity with any of the following: </p>
<ul><li>A valid passport </li>
  <li>A current Irish driving licence </li>
  <li>A National Age Card (issued by An Garda Síochána) </li>
  <li>An identification form with a photograph signed by a member of An Garda
    Síochána </li>
  <li>Documents issued by government departments showing your name. </li>
</ul><p>Government documents must be verified by a statement from a person in a
position of responsibility such as a solicitor, accountant, doctor or social
worker. That person must also come to the bank themselves with proof of their
own identity. </p>

<p><strong>Proof of address</strong></p>

<p>You can provide evidence of your address with any of these documents:</p>
<ul><li>A current utility bill (such as a gas, electricity or telephone or mobile
    phone bill) </li>
  <li>A current car or home insurance policy that shows your address </li>
  <li>A document issued by a government department that shows your address </li>
  <li>A list of your tax credits </li>
  <li>A current balancing statement from Revenue</li>
  <li>A social insurance document (that shows your address) </li>
  <li>A letter from your employer or licensed employment agency stating that
    you have recently arrived in Ireland and have started work but cannot yet
    provide evidence of your Irish address (you will have to provide evidence
    of your address at a later date)</li>
</ul><p>In some cases <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Topics/PPSN/Pages/faq.aspx">a bank may ask you
for your PPS number</a> – for example, if you are claiming tax relief on the
interest paid on a mortgage loan. </p>

<p>Copies of all documentation used to establish the identity of the customer
must be retained for 5 years after an account is closed. Also, copies of
transactions must be kept for 5 years after the date of the transaction. </p>

<p>Bank staff are required to know the nature of their customers' business and
can ask for information about the level and type of business that is likely to
be transacted through the account. You can also be asked to provide
confirmation of the source of your funds and to give reasons for carrying out
certain transactions. </p>

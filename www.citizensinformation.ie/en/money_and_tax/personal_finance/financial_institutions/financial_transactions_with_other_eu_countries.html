<p>Under EU law bank charges for financial transactions should be the same
within EU member states and between EU states. For example, if you withdraw
money from your Irish bank account using an ATM in Germany the charge for this
transaction should be equivalent to the charge you would pay if you withdrew
the same amount using an Irish ATM which is not part of your bank network.</p>

<p><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:266:0011:0018:EN:PDF">Regulation
(EC) No 924/2009 (pdf)</a> deals with charges for cross-border and national
payments in euro. It applies to payments in euro in all EU member states. The
objective is to make sure that charges for equivalent national and cross border
financial transactions in euro are the same.</p>

<p>The basic principle is that the charges for financial transactions offered
by a payment service provider (your bank) must be the same, for payments of the
same value, whether the payment is national (and not your own bank) or
cross-border. You cannot be charged extra fees (for example, annual fees or
once-off charges) for using your card in other EU member states.</p>

<p>The Regulation applies to all electronically-processed payments,
including</p>
<ul><li>Credit transfers</li>
  <li>Direct debits</li>
  <li>Cash withdrawals at cash dispensers (ATMs)</li>
  <li>Debit and credit card payments</li>
  <li>Money remittance</li>
</ul><p>Some conditions may apply depending on the payment type. For example, for
credit transfers and direct debits, you must use an International Bank Account
Number (IBAN) and Bank Identifier Code (BIC) when ordering the payment.</p>

<p>The Regulation does not apply to cheques (mainly because the use of cheques
is declining across the EU) and it does not apply to currency conversions to
and from euro.</p>

<h4>How long should money transfers within the EU take?</h4>

<p>The Regulation does not deal with this issue. However the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2007:319:0001:0036:EN:PDF">Payment
Services Directive (2007/64/EC) (pdf)</a> states that for cross-border
transfers that do not involve a currency exchange (for example, euro transfers)
that the money should be available by the end of the next business day. This
can be extended by one business day if the transaction is initiated by a paper
order. This Directive was transposed into Irish law by <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/si/0383.html">the European
Communities (Payment Services) Regulations 2009. </a></p>

<h2>SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area)</h2>

<p>The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) will make all electronic payments
across the euro area as easy as domestic electronic payments within one country
are now. The SEPA project is supported by the European Commission and the
European Central Bank. SEPA is being implemented by 34 countries – the 28 EU
member states (including countries which do not use the euro) plus Norway,
Iceland, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, San Marino and Monaco.</p>

<p>To achieve this, a common set of payment instruments was developed, together
with common standards and a legal basis for making payments across Europe fast,
efficient and safe.</p>

<p>The introduction of SEPA will allow you to:</p>
<ul><li>Use your debit card anywhere in the euro area</li>
  <li>Make cross-border bank transfers securely, promptly and in full</li>
  <li>Set up direct debits from anywhere in the euro area</li>
  <li>Need only one bank account for the whole euro area</li>
</ul><p>You cannot be obliged by a payer or payee to maintain a bank account in any
particular country to make or receive payments. For example, an Irish person
working in France could have their French employer pay his/her salary directly
to their Irish account and use that account to pay direct debits and bills in
France.</p>

<h3>Main changes for consumers</h3>

<p>The main change is the way your bank and account is identified for making
and receiving payments. You will need to use the BIC (Bank Identifier Code) and
IBAN (International Bank Account Number) to identify your bank and account
rather than the NSC (National Sort Code) and Account Number (sometimes referred
to as BBAN, or ‘basic bank account number’). </p>

<p>Individual consumers will be informed directly by their banks about any
changes to their account terms and conditions arising from SEPA
implementation.</p>

<p>From 1 February 2014 it became mandatory to retire existing ‘national
only’ payment systems in the euro area and move all electronic payments to
SEPA standards. For EU member states with other currencies than the euro the
end-date is 31 October 2016 for all credit transfers and direct debits in euro.
</p>

<p>The Payment Services Directive (which was transposed into Irish law as the
<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/si/0383.html">European
Communities (Payment Services) Regulations 2009</a>) provides the legal
framework for SEPA.</p>

<p>You can find out more about SEPA from the <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/paycurr/sepa/Pages/default.aspx">Central Bank
of Ireland</a> and the <a href="http://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/sepa/html/index.en.html">European Central
Bank</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="lef21f">Where to apply</h2>

<p>If you believe that your bank is not charging you the same amount for
national and cross-border payments you should contact them (preferably in
writing) and ask for clarification and resolution of your problem.</p>

<p>If you believe that the rules of Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 have been
breached, you should contact the <a href="central_bank_and_financial_services_authority_of_ireland.html">Central
Bank in Ireland</a> or the relevant authority in the country where the problem
occurred. (You can find a list of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/docs/reg-924_2009/competent_authorities_en.pdf">national
competent authorities (pdf)</a>.)</p>

<p>Alternatively, if your problem appears to be a bank error rather than the
incorrect application of the Regulation rules, you may contact the <a href="../../../consumer_affairs/financial_services/financial_products/protection_of_consumers_of_financial_services.html">Financial
Services Ombudsman in Ireland</a> or the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/payments/docs/reg-924_2009/redress_bodies_en.pdf">relevant
national out-of-court redress body (pdf)</a> and ask them to mediate in the
resolution of your dispute.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Many people in Ireland do not have bank accounts because of the cost or
because they have never opened or used a bank account. These people are
<em>financially excluded</em>. A person is considered financially excluded when
he/she either has no access to services offered by mainstream financial
institutions or does not use these services.</p>

<p>A standard bank account is a new type of account with no fees or charges for
normal day-to-day services and no Government stamp duty on ATM or debit cards.
The introduction of a standard bank account aims to reduce the number of people
in Ireland who do not have a current account and help those people to manage
their finances.</p>

<p>A pilot standard bank account was introduced in 2012 as part of the <a href="http://www.finance.gov.ie/sites/default/files/SBA%20Report%20FINAL%2029%20Nov%202013.pdf">Government’s
Strategy for Financial Inclusion</a> and <a href="national_payments_plan.html">National Payments Plan</a>. It is
intended to introduce a standard bank account nationwide when the findings from
the pilot have been analysed.</p>

<p>People whose only income is a social welfare payment will be able to open a
standard bank account.</p>

<p>If the money going into your account - apart from any social welfare
payments paid into your account by the Department of Social Protection, is
usually under €4,500 in a quarter (a 3-month period) you will be able to open
and keep a standard bank account.</p>

<h3>Costs of a standard bank account</h3>

<p>Normal, day-to-day services are free with a standard bank account. These
include:</p>
<ul><li>Taking out money at an ATM (cash machine)</li>
  <li>Using a debit card in a shop to pay for something and also for getting
    cash-back in a shop</li>
  <li>Transferring money to another bank account</li>
  <li>Transferring money to pay a bill (like your electricity or heating)</li>
  <li>Setting up and changing a standing order (this is where you have a
    regular amount coming out of your account and going into a savings account
    or to pay bills)</li>
  <li>Putting money into the account (making a lodgement)</li>
  <li>Getting a regular statement that tells you what is in your account and
    what you have taken out</li>
  <li>Using phone banking and internet banking (there may be phone call or data
    charges)</li>
</ul><p>Using your card while abroad may incur charges and you cannot get an
overdraft or a cheque book with a standard bank account. </p>

<h3>Standard Bank Account Pilot</h3>

<p>A pilot scheme took place in 2012 to test the response of consumers who open
a standard bank account and determine if the product meets their needs. The
pilot will inform the planned national roll-out of standard bank accounts,
scheduled for 2013. A report on the pilot scheme is due.</p>

<p>The standard bank account was offered during the pilot by Bank of Ireland,
Allied Irish Banks and Permanent TSB in three locations:</p>
<ul><li>Tallaght</li>
  <li>Tullamore</li>
  <li>New Ross</li>
</ul></div>

<p>Standard bank accounts are not currently available. It is intended that they
will be introduced once the findings from the pilot scheme have been
analysed.</p>

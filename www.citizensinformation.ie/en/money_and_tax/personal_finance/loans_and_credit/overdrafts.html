<p>An <em>overdraft</em> is an additional amount of money that can be drawn
from a current account when it is in debit. (In other words, an additional
amount of money drawn from your account when it is below zero). Overdrafts are
generally a short-term facility used to temporarily increase cashflow and
allows you to spend more than you have in your current account. Although
interest rates on an overdraft can be high, you only pay interest on the amount
you use. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>If your current account has regular incomings and outgoings, then a bank
will usually grant you an overdraft. If money going into an account is
withdrawn almost immediately and is not held in the account for any significant
amount of time, then the bank might not grant an overdraft as it could see this
as an inability to repay. </p>

<p></p><ul><li>Overdrafts are available on current accounts only.</li>
  <li>Overdraft facilities are provided at the discretion of your financial
    institution.</li>
  <li>An overdraft and the amount that will be granted to you in the form of an
    overdraft, in most cases, depends on the history of transactions in the
    current account. If you have a bad <a shape="rect" href="irish_credit_bureau.html">credit history</a>, you may find it
    difficult to obtain an overdraft.</li>
  <li>You pay back the amount overdrawn when the funds become available in the
    account.</li>
  <li>Overdrafts can be temporary or permanent. </li>
</ul><p></p>

<h3>If you are having difficulty paying back an overdraft</h3>

<p>If you are having difficulty paying back an overdraft, you can ask for a
time extension from the bank. This will be granted if your payment history is
satisfactory. </p>

<p>If you continue to experience difficulty in paying pack the overdraft and
are getting further and further into debt, you can contact the <a shape="rect" href="../debt/mabs_service.html">Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS)</a>.
MABS will work with you to establish how much money you can afford to pay back
per month. It will then contact the bank directly on your behalf. MABS will
arrange with the bank for you to pay back a certain amount every month until
the overdraft decreases and the debt is cleared. MABS offers this service free
of charge. </p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Many banks charge a fee for setting up an overdraft and there is usually an
annual fee (called a renewal fee) for an overdraft facility. </p>

<p>The amount that an account can be overdrawn (overdraft limit) is agreed in
advance between the current account holder and the financial institution. </p>

<p>You pay interest on the amount you owe at any one time, not on the total
overdraft limit available to you. The interest rate on overdrafts is usually a
little higher than the rate charged on personal loans and can range from about
11% to about 15% depending on your bank.</p>

<p>If you go over your agreed overdraft limit surcharge interest can be
charged. </p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You should contact your bank or building society if you wish to find out
about overdraft facilities. Applying for an overdraft includes filling out a
form and can also involve meeting with the financial institution's officials.
Some institutions have 24-hour help lines that take applications over the
phone. Some institutions also have web sites where applications can be made
online. </p>

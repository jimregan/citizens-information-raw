<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Irish Credit Bureau (ICB) is the biggest credit-referencing agency in
Ireland. It is a private organisation, owned and financed by its <a shape="rect" href="http://www.icb.ie/membership.php">members</a>, which are the
main financial institutions, including many credit unions. Local authorities
are also members. Membership does not include utility companies or retail
outlets.</p>

<p>The ICB maintains a database of information on the performance of credit
agreements, such as mortgages; car loans; other personal loans; leasing
agreements; hire purchase agreements and credit cards. It does not monitor
overdraft agreements, with the exception of overdraft agreements that are the
subject of legal proceedings. Lenders usually send information to the ICB on a
monthly basis.</p>

<p>Each time you apply for credit from an ICB member, they can access your
credit file to check your performance. Typically, your repayment history over a
24-month period is included in this credit report, including where you may have
missed payments. The lender can ask the ICB for a <em>credit score</em> or <a href="../debt/credit_ratings.html">credit rating</a>, calculated on the
basis of your credit history. If you have come to an agreement with your lender
to postpone repayments, this will not affect your credit rating.</p>

<p>You can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.icb.ie/pdf/Sample%20Credit%20Report.pdf">view a sample credit
report (pdf)</a> on the ICB's website. </p>

<h3>Credit cards and credit history</h3>

<p>The ICB records credit card repayment performance on a monthly basis but,
due to the nature of credit cards, you also get an additional 30 days before
any negative information about your performance is recorded. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Access to your records </h3>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.dataprotection.ie/documents/legal/CompendiumAct.pdf">Data
Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 (pdf)</a>, you are entitled to inspect your
credit record. If the information stored about you is incorrect, you are
entitled to have it amended and, in certain circumstances, you may also have
the right to have it removed from your file. If you wish to have inaccurate
information on your credit record amended, contact the lender concerned and ask
them to forward the correct information to the ICB. The ICB cannot change the
information unless asked to do so by the relevant lender.</p>

<p>If your request for access to your personal credit information is ignored or
your request for a correction of inaccurate information is refused, you can
complain to the <a href="../../../government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/data_protection.html">Data
Protection Commissioner</a>, who has legal powers to ensure that your rights
are protected. </p>

<p>In addition, if you suffer damage through the mishandling of personal
information held on computer, you may be entitled to claim compensation through
the courts. </p>

<h3>Adding a personal declaration to your credit record</h3>

<p>It is possible to add a personal statement to your credit record to clarify
it. For example, if you have incurred significant costs due to relationship
breakdown, bereavement, illness or another cause, you may add these details to
your record.</p>

<p>The text of the note must be less than 200 words, must be relevant to
matters contained in the record and must not be frivolous, vexatious or
denigratory.</p>

<p>The ICB will attach this personal declaration to your file and it can be
viewed when your data is accessed. However, lenders are not obliged to take
your statement into account while checking your credit history when assessing
you for a loan. </p>

<h3>How long is my credit history recorded for?</h3>

<p>The Irish Credit Bureau’s database will only hold information about you if
you have had an active loan in the past 5 years and if your lender has provided
information to the ICB. All records remain on the database for 5 years once the
loan has been closed, whether you repaid the debt or not.</p>

<h3>Can I get past bad credit details removed from my credit record?</h3>

<p>Yes, but only if these details are incorrect. All lenders are obliged to
provide an honest and truthful record of your credit agreements and
transactions. This record will include details of bad debts or failures to
repay. </p>

<p>Note that, when you initially apply for a loan of any kind, you will have to
sign a consent form, which states that you are aware that a record of your
repayments on this loan will be kept and will form part of your credit
history.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You can get a copy of your credit record by <a shape="rect" href="https://secure.icb.ie/cr_personal.jsp?js=true">applying online</a> to the
Irish Credit Bureau and paying €6. For security reasons, it will be posted
out to you. It will not be emailed. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you can download a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.icb.ie/pdf/Personal%20Application.pdf">Personal Enquiry Form
(pdf)</a> or request an application form from the ICB. Send the completed
application form with payment of €6 to the address below.</p>

<p>Only 1 search can be conducted per application, and the ICB takes about 3 or
4 days to process each one.</p>

<p>The report that the ICB issues will display a unique reference number. You
may then contact the ICB to discuss your report, quoting this unique number.
You cannot discuss your credit record with the ICB by phone until you have
received the report.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>There is a series of regulatory requirements that govern the advertising of
financial services and credit. The Central Bank of Ireland <a href="https://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/processes/consumer-protection-code/compliance-monitoring/Pages/advertising-monitoring.aspx">monitors
such advertising</a> by the firms that it regulates and ensures that their
advertisements comply with these requirements.</p>

<p>The credit provider (the lender) is responsible for ensuring that its
advertisements comply with these rules. Lenders must not publish, display, or
submit to others (for example, a publisher) any advertisement that breaks the
rules.</p>

<p>To check whether a financial services firm is regulated by the Central Bank,
you can check the register at <a href="http://registers.centralbank.ie/">registers.centralbank.ie</a>. </p>

<h3>Requirements for the advertising of credit</h3>

<p>In general, advertising of financial services and credit must be clear,
fair, accurate and not misleading. Headline claims and offers in advertising
materials must be balanced with information on areas such as risks, fees and
charges so that consumers can make fully informed choices.</p>

<p>The main requirements are in the following legislation and codes:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/EN_ACT_1995_0024.PDF">Consumer
    Credit Act 1995 (pdf)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2000/si/294/made/en/print">European
    Communities (Consumer Credit) Regulations 2000</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2007/si/60/made/en/print">European
    Communities (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations 2007</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/processes/consumer-protection-code/Documents/Consumer%20Protection%20Code%20for%20Licensed%20Moneylenders.pdf">Consumer
    Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders 2009 (pdf)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2010/si/281/made/en/print">European
    Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/processes/consumer-protection-code/Documents/Consumer%20Protection%20Code%202012.pdf">Consumer
    Protection Code 2012 (pdf)</a></li>
</ul><h3>Standard information</h3>

<p>Under Section 7 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2010/si/281/made/en/print">European
Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010</a>, any advertising
concerning credit agreements that indicates an interest rate, or any figures
relating to the cost of the credit to the consumer, must include standard
information. This standard information must specify clearly, concisely and
prominently, using a representative example;</p>
<ul><li><p>The borrowing rate (fixed or variable or both) and details of any
    charges included in the total <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/choosing-a-loan#costofcredit">cost of the
    credit</a> to the consumer</p>
  </li>
  <li>The total amount of credit</li>
  <li>The annual percentage rate of charge (except in the case of an
  overdraft)</li>
  <li>If applicable, the duration of the credit agreement</li>
  <li>If the credit is in the form of deferred payment for a specific good or
    service, the cash price and the amount of any advance payment</li>
</ul><p>and</p>
<ul><li>If applicable, the total amount that the consumer is required to pay and
    the amount of the instalments</li>
</ul><p>If the consumer is required to conclude a contract for another service (such
as insurance) in order to access the credit agreement as advertised, and if the
cost of this service is not known in advance, this requirement must be stated
clearly, concisely and prominently as part of the standard information.</p>

<p>In 2014, the Central Bank published its <a href="https://www.centralbank.ie/press-area/press-releases/Pages/CentralBankpublishesfindingsofReviewofCompliancewiththeAdvertisingrequirementsoftheConsumerCreditRegulations.aspx">review
of the banking, moneylending and credit union sectors’ compliance with these
requirements</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l2f32a">Advertising financial accommodation</h2>

<p><em>Financial accommodation</em> is the term used to describe a <a shape="rect" href="hire_purchase.html">hire purchase agreement</a>, a consumer
hire agreement or the provision of a service. Advertisements for these must
include: </p>
<ul><li>The kind of the accommodation - hire purchase or other arrangement</li>
  <li>The cash price of the goodsor service </li>
  <li>The total <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/choosing-a-loan#costofcredit">cost of
    credit</a> or the hire-purchase price </li>
  <li>Details of the number, amounts and timing of instalments </li>
  <li>Details of any deposit involved in agreement </li>
  <li>The numbers of instalments that need to be paid before you will receive
    delivery of goods </li>
  <li>Any details concerning another form of credit, which might be used as a
    comparison in the advertisement </li>
</ul><p>An advertisement for credit cannot be described as being "free from
interest" if it concludes that there is an extra maintenance or insurance
contract involved. </p>

<h3>Consumer hire agreements</h3>

<p>There are, in addition to the provisions outlined above, certain
requirements that particularly apply to consumer hire or leasing agreements.
The fact that ownership does not pass to the consumer in a leasing agreement
must be stated in any advertising. The statements "Letting, Hiring or Leasing
of the Goods Only" and "The Goods Remain the Property of the Owner" should be
included. These statements should be in at least as prominent a position as any
sum payable by the hirer and enclosed in a boundary box in a visual
advertisement. The amount that is payable by the hirer must be indicated in the
advertisement and include all amounts, including taxes. </p>

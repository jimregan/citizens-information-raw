<p>At some stage in life most people are likely to borrow money. There are many
different types of credit and loans. You should get the right loan for your
needs and should shop around for the best loan.</p>

<p>Consumers who borrow money are protected in legislation by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Consumer
Credit Act 1995</a>. This Act covers all types of credit and credit
institutions must comply with this law. The Act also prescribes the <a shape="rect" href="credit_advertising.html">ways in which credit may be
advertised</a>. If you are having <a href="../debt/dealing_with_debt.html">trouble paying off a loan</a> the
Money Advice and Budgeting Service (<a shape="rect" href="../debt/mabs_service.html">MABS</a>) may be able to help.</p>

<p>Generally, banks, building societies and other credit institutions <a href="../savings_and_investments/comparing_interest_on_savings_and_investments.html">charge
for the use of borrowed money</a>. This payment is called 'interest' and it is
calculated on the amount of money you borrow and the length of time that you
borrow it. You may also have to pay fees to cover administrative expenses on
your loan. </p>

<h3>Before you borrow money</h3>

<p>If you are borrowing money or buying goods it is important that you
<span>ensure that you can </span>afford to pay back what you borrow. Be
realistic about your living costs. Make sure that any money you have left after
you pay for essentials is sufficient to cover the cost of a loan. Check whether
you can save enough money to buy what you need rather than getting a loan. You
can also reduce the amount that you may need to borrow by using money that you
have saved. </p>

<p><span><strong>Get a loan to suit your needs</strong></span></p>

<p>There are many different types of loans and credit. Each type of credit is
suitable for a different purpose. Some are more suited to short-term borrowing
and others are more suited to medium to long-term borrowing.</p>

<p><span><strong>Shop around for the best value</strong></span></p>

<p>Banks, building societies and credit unions all offer a range of loans. When
comparing charges for the use of borrowed money, interest on loans must be
presented as the Annual Percentage Rate (APR). The APR states what percentage
of the amount you borrow you will be charged in addition to paying back the
loan amount. It is important that you compare like with like. Loans can be paid
back over different terms or lengths of time. You may think that you are
getting a good deal on a loan with a low APR but if you are paying more
instalments over a longer period of time you may find that it will cost you
more. Cost of credit is another way of comparing loans which looks at the total
cost of the loan. </p>

<p>The Central Bank authorises banks, building societies and credit unions. You
should only borrow from an authorised financial service provider. This protects
you and your money from unscrupulous lenders. If you are unsure if the company
that you are dealing with is authorised contact the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/Pages/home.aspx">Central Bank</a> to
find out.</p>

<p>You can access <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/loan-calculator">a loan
calculator</a> to help you work out repayments on a loan at <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/">consumerhelp.ie</a>. You can also compare
personal loans, credit cards and overdrafts with <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/compare">financial product comparison
tools</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="le50a0">Types of credit</h2>

<p>There are many different forms of credit including: </p>
<ul><li><strong>Overdrafts:</strong> An <a href="overdrafts.html">overdraft</a> is a way of borrowing on your bank
    account. Overdrafts are given on your current account so that when your
    balance is 0 in your account you can still spend up to a certain limit. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Credit cards</strong>: A <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/credit-cards">credit card</a> allows you
    to borrow money on a monthly basis. There is no interest charged on
    borrowings if you pay your full bill within a set number of days. Credit
    cards are flexible and can be used to pay for items and services that you
    may buy on-line or by telephone. Credit cards are accepted as a means of
    payment for goods and services or for accessing cash in other countries.
    They are not suitable for long-term borrowing as interest rates are high.
    If you have a problem with an item you have purchased your credit card bill
    or statement can be used as proof of purchase. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Personal loans (from banks or building societies): </strong>Banks
    and building societies offer <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/personal-loans">personal loans</a> to
    customers. These loans are suitable for medium and longer term needs, for
    example, a car loan or a loan for home improvements. Banks or building
    societies may also charge other fees and charges. Generally, you pay a
    fixed amount back every month. If your loan is a variable rate loan you may
    be able to pay more than this back when you have it. This allows you to pay
    off the loan sooner. It is not advisable to take out personal loans to
    cover day-to-day expenses. 
    <p><strong></strong></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Credit union loans:</strong> <a href="../financial_institutions/credit_unions.html">Credit unions</a>
    also offer loans to consumers. You must be a member of a credit union
    before you can take out a loan. Credit unions are based in the community or
    workplace and you must be living or working in a particular area or working
    for a particular employer to become a member. You may need to have saved
    some money in a credit union before getting a loan. Credit union loans are
    suitable for short and longer-term needs such as loans for holidays or
    cars. They are also useful for refinancing other loans. Some credit unions
    are offering <a href="microcredit_loans.html">a new type of loan called
    an It Makes Sense loan</a>. This loan is aimed at people getting social
    welfare payments who repay the loan through the Household Budget Scheme. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Hire purchase: </strong>This is a <a href="hire_purchase.html">hire agreement</a> offered by shops or garages
    so that you can hire and eventually buy particular items. Items bought on
    hire purchase are normally expensive items such as a car or furniture or
    electronic equipment. You do not own the item until the last instalment of
    the loan is paid. While the Central Bank regulates finance companies, the
    <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nca.ie/eng/">Competition and Consumer
    Protection Commission</a> regulates credit intermediaries (as well as
    pawnbrokers). In a <a shape="rect" href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/hire_purchase.html">hire
    purchase agreement</a> ownership of the items passes to you after the last
    instalment is paid. In a <a shape="rect" href="consumer_affairs/consumer_protection/consumer_rights/consumer_hire_agreements.html">consumer
    hire agreement</a> the goods are hired and will always belong to the
    consumer hire company. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Credit sale agreements:</strong> These agreements are similar to
    hire purchase agreements in that an item is purchased and paid for in
    instalments. A major difference is that a buyer immediately owns the goods
    bought under a credit sale agreement. The APR charged on this type of loan
    is generally higher than that of credit cards but cannot be above 23%. Like
    hire purchase loans this type of credit is not flexible. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Mortgages and top-up mortgages:</strong> If you are a homeowner
    <a href="../../../housing/owning_a_home/help_with_buying_a_home/paying_for_a_home.html">a
    mortgage</a> is the largest single financial product that you are likely to
    buy in your life. A <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/topping-up-mortage">top-up mortgage</a> is
    a way of extending your mortgage to consolidate your debts or to pay for a
    car or other large purchase. Although APRs are low, this type of loan may
    cost you substantially more in the long run if you pay it back over a
    longer term. These loans - like your mortgage - are secured on your home so
    it is extremely important that you keep up repayments otherwise your home
    may be at risk. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Moneylending:</strong> Moneylending is the practice of giving
    cash loans or supplying goods or services that are repaid at a high level
    of interest over a short period of time. Banks, building societies,
    insurance companies and credit unions are not considered moneylenders. <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/moneylending_in_ireland.html">Moneylenders
    are generally either individuals or companies whose main business is to
    lend money</a>.</li>
</ul></div>
<h2>Credit history and your right to privacy</h2>

<p>If you have ever used credit you will have a credit history. A credit
institution can refuse to give you a loan if you have not complied with the
terms and conditions of previous loans. The Irish Credit Bureau keeps a
database of all borrowers and credit institutions can check the status of
previous loans taken by a potential borrower. <a shape="rect" href="irish_credit_bureau.html">You can find out more about your credit rating
and the Irish Credit Bureau</a>.</p>

<p>When you have entered into a credit agreement, the Consumer Credit Act 1995
protects your rights.Your <a href="../debt/debt_collection.html">entitlement
to privacy is protected and there are rules about lenders contacting you</a>.
These restrictions are legally binding on all lenders and are designed to
protect your privacy as a consumer. For example, the Act prohibits visits or
telephone calls from an authorised financial institution about the agreement to
you without your consent at any place between 9pm and 9am weekdays, or at any
time on Sundays or public holidays. Calls or visits to your place of work are
prohibited unless you live there, or if reasonable efforts to contact you have
failed. Only the person(s) involved in the credit agreement may be contacted
(unless other arrangements have been made). </p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>A pilot microcredit scheme was launched in over 30 credit unions in November
2015. Microcredit is the lending of small amounts of money at low interest
rates. The scheme aims to reduce dependence on moneylenders with very high
interest rates. The pilot was a success and it is now being rolled out across
all credit unions in the Republic of Ireland. Participation by a credit union
in the scheme is on a voluntary basis.</p>

<p>Loans under the initiative are called <a href="http://itmakessenseloan.ie/">It Makes Sense loans</a>. You can get <a href="http://itmakessenseloan.ie/participating-credit-unions/">a list of
participating credit unions</a> on the itmakessenseloan.ie website.</p>

<p>It Makes Sense Loans are available to people getting a social welfare
payment who may not be able to get credit from other sources. You must also
qualify for the <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/household_budget_scheme.html">Household
Budget Scheme</a> or, if your social welfare payment is paid into a bank
account or a credit union account, you must agree to repay the loan standing
order or direct debit. Loan values will be between €100 and €2,000 and a
maximum interest rate of 12% (12.68% APR) will apply.</p>

<p>If you are not a member of your <a href="../financial_institutions/credit_unions.html">local credit union</a>
you can join very quickly (provided that you live in the local area) and be
considered immediately for an It Makes Sense loan. Loans can be granted quickly, in some cases within 24 hours.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p>The minimum loan amount is €100 and the maximum amount you can borrow is

Budget Scheme</a> or by direct debit or standing order from your bank or credit
union account. The maximum deduction allowed under the Household Budget Scheme
is 25% of your weekly social welfare payment. This includes any other
deductions that you may have under the Household Budget Scheme (for example,
for rent or for household bills). </p>

Sense loan is 1% a month or 12% a year (12.68% APR).</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You apply for an It Makes Sense loan through your local credit union. The decision to grant a loan remains entirely with the participating credit union.</p>

<h3>Joining the credit union</h3>

<p>If you are not already a member of the credit union you need to provide
evidence of your name, address and PPS number. You will need:</p>
<ul><li>Proof of your identity - for example, a current passport, driving licence
    or <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/public_services_card.html">Public
    Services Card</a></li>
  <li>Proof of your address - for example, a recent household bill or recent
    Government-issued documentation such as a letter from the Department of
    Social Protection.</li>
  <li>Your <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/personal_public_service_number.html">PPS
    number</a></li>
</ul><h3>Applying for an It Makes Sense loan</h3>

<p>You need to bring 2 consecutive social welfare slips (from within the
previous 4 weeks) if you collect your weekly payment at the post office or 2
months bank/credit union statements if you receive your social welfare payment
into a bank or credit union account to your credit union.</p>

<p>Your local credit union will help you fill out a loan application form and
complete the form to allow deductions from the household budget scheme.</p>

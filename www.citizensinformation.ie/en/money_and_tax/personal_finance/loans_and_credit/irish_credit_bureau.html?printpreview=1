<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="la82be">Information</h2>

<p>The Irish Credit Bureau (ICB) is the biggest credit-referencing agency in
Ireland. It is not a state body - it is owned and financed by <a shape="rect" href="http://www.icb.ie/membership.php">ICB members</a>, which are mainly
financial institutions. The bureau is an electronic library or database that
contains information on the performance of credit agreements between financial
institutions (for example, banks and building societies) and borrowers (the
citizen). A credit agreement can include a mortgage, car and personal loans and
leasing and hire purchase agreements. Credit card details are included in the
ICB library. Overdraft agreements, with the exception of overdraft agreements
that are the subject of legal proceedings, are not monitored by the ICB. </p>

<p>Lending institutions register information with the ICB, usually on a monthly
basis. Each time you apply for credit from one of these lenders, the lender
accesses your credit file to find out about your performance under previous
credit agreements with other lenders. Typically, your payment profile history
over a 24-month repayment period is included in this credit report. All loans
are registered with the ICB, including instances where you may have missed
payments in the past. If, however, you have come to an agreement with your
lender to postpone payment of a previous loan, this will not affect your credit
rating.</p>

<p>You can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.icb.ie/pdf/Sample%20Credit%20Report.pdf">view a sample credit
report (pdf)</a> of the kind kept by the ICB. </p>

<h3>Credit Rating</h3>

<p>The ICB does not score citizens on the basis of their credit history. It
simply records information and passes this information to lenders who make
their own credit assessment based on the details available on the files. </p>

<h3>Credit cards and credit history</h3>

<p>In the past, information was mainly supplied by the lenders only where
credit cards were revoked or cancelled. Now lenders have the option of
supplying full information about opening and closing balances to the ICB. Your
card repayment performance will be measured by the ICB on a monthly basis but
due to the nature of credit cards, you also get an additional 30 days before
negative information about your record is recorded. </p>

<h3>Length of time records are kept for</h3>

<p>Members of the Irish Credit Bureau send information about to the loans they
have given to their customers to the Bureau. Therefore, information about a
loan will be kept on the ICB database for the full term of the loan whether
this is a 3-year personal loan or a 30-year mortgage. The ICB Member records
the customer's performance on the repayments and this information is then sent
to ICB where it is also recorded. </p>

<p>When the loan is completed or when it reaches a <span>frozen</span> state
(that is when it is <span>Written Off)</span> the 5-year retention term
<span>clock</span> starts ticking. In other words, regardless of what the
customer’s performance on the loan was like, once the loan is
<span>terminated</span> in its current state - it will then stay on the ICB
Database for 5 years from that date.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Access to your records </h3>

<p>If you are concerned that the credit information stored about you may be
incorrect or out of date, you are entitled to inspect your own personal record
under the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. In addition, if the information
stored about you is incorrect, you are entitled to have this information
amended and in certain circumstances, you may also have the right to have this
information removed from your file.</p>

<p>If your request for access to your personal credit information is ignored or
your request for a correction of inaccurate information is refused, you can
complain to the <a href="http://dataprotection.ie/">Data Protection
Commissioner</a>. The Data Protection Commissioner is appointed by Government
and has legal powers to ensure your rights are protected. </p>

<p>In addition, if you suffer damage through the mishandling of personal
information held on computer, you may be entitled to claim compensation through
the courts. </p>

<h3>Adding a personal declaration to your credit record</h3>

<p>It is possible to add a personal declaration (statement) to your own credit
record to clarify your credit record. For example, if you have incurred
significant costs (following the breakdown of a relationship, a bereavement, an
illness, accident, etc.) you may add these details to your credit record. </p>

<p>The text of the note must be less than 200 words, must be relevant to
matters contained in the record and must not be frivolous, vexatious or
denigratory. </p>

<p>This personal declaration is then attached to your file by the Irish Credit
Bureau and can be viewed when your data is accessed. Remember that a lender is
not obliged to take your statement into account while reviewing or checking
your credit history when you are being assessed for a loan. </p>

<h3>How long is my credit history recorded for?</h3>

<p>All records remain on the ICB database for 5 years once the account has been
completed. This is the situation irrespective of whether you repaid the debt or
you failed to complete payments.</p>

<h3>Can I get past bad credit details removed from my credit record?</h3>

<p>You may, but only if these details are incorrect and you are seeking to
amend them. All banks and financial institutions in Ireland are obliged to
provide an honest and truthful record of your credit agreements and
transactions. If an honest and truthful record includes details of bad debts or
failures to repay, then these are included on your record. You should be aware
that when you initally apply for a loan of any kind in Ireland, you are
required to sign a consent form which essentially states that you are aware
that a history of your repayments on this loan will be kept and will form part
of your credit history. </p>

<p>However, the details of your credit record with any financial
institution/bank are between you and that institution. If your credit record
was bad a long time ago but has now been rectified, you may be able to have
this information removed from your record. However, this is <span>only if the
bank/financial institution agrees to this</span> - they are not obliged to by
law, nor required to do so as part of their own policy. Check with the
financial institution involved. Some financial institutions may operate
discretionary powers and if for example, the debts were incurred due to
exceptional circumstances or extreme hardship, they may be willing to assist
you.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>If you want to inspect your credit record data, the fee is €6. Fee must be
accompanied by the application form. </p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>Citizens can inspect their credit records by completing an application form
from the ICB. You can <a shape="rect" href="https://secure.icb.ie/cr_personal.jsp?js=true">apply online for details
of your credit record</a>. (Note that your credit record will be posted out to
you and <strong>will not be emailed</strong> to you (for security reasons)).
You also need a credit or debit card to apply and pay online for your record.
</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can download a <a shape="rect" href="http://www.icb.ie/pdf/Personal%20Application.pdf">Personal Enquiry Form
(pdf)</a> and use it to apply for details of your credit record. You can <a shape="rect" href="http://www.icb.ie/contact_us.php">request an application
form for details of your credit record</a>. Send your completed application
form with the appropriate fee to the address below. </p>

<p><span>Only 1 search</span> can be conducted per application. </p>

<p>Processing time begins from the time the ICB receive your form and usually
takes approximately 3 or 4 days. </p>

<p>When you receive your ICB report, it will display a unique reference number.
You then may contact ICB to discuss your report, but remember to quote your
unique number. You cannot discuss your credit report with ICB by telephone
<strong>until</strong> you have received your report. </p>

<p>If you wish to have inaccurate information on your credit record amended,
contact the ICB.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Moneylending is the practice of giving cash loans or supplying goods or
services repaid at a high level of interest over a short period of time. Banks,
building societies, insurance companies and credit unions are not considered
moneylenders. </p>

<p>Moneylenders are generally either individuals or companies whose main
business is to lend money. They are required to hold a licence to trade in
moneylending. The <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/industry-sectors/money-lenders/Pages/default.aspx">Central
Bank of Ireland regulates the activities of moneylenders</a> and is responsible
for issuing moneylending licences in Ireland. </p>

<h3>Money lending licences</h3>

<p>The Central Bank (before granting a moneylending licence), will take into
consideration a wide range of factors, including the trading background and
reputation of the moneylender and the cost of credit that is proposed to be
charged. Licences are renewed each year. The Central Bank maintains <a href="http://registers.centralbank.ie/DownloadsPage.aspx">a register of
licensed moneylenders</a>. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lb2560">Moneylending agreements</h2>

<p>A moneylending agreement is defined as a credit agreement where one or more
of the following apply:</p>
<ul><li>The agreement was concluded away from the business premises of the
    moneylender or the business premises of the supplier of goods or services
    under the agreement</li>
  <li>Any negotiations for, or in relation to the credit, were conducted at a
    place other than the business premises of the moneylender or the business
    premises of the supplier of goods or services under the agreement</li>
  <li>Repayments under the agreement will, or may, be paid by the consumer to
    the moneylender or their representative at any place other than the
    business premises of the moneylender or the business premises of the
    supplier of goods or services under the agreement</li>
  <li>Where the total cost of credit to the consumer under the agreement is in
    excess of an APR of 23% or such other rate as may be prescribed.</li>
</ul><p>Under the <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/industry-sectors/money-lenders/Pages/default.aspx">Central
Bank’s Consumer Code for Licensed Moneylenders</a> you must get detailed
information about the loan in your lending agreement and your money lender must
also tell you that the loan has a high cost.</p>

<p>The lending agreement must:</p>
<ul><li>Be in writing and include the names and addresses of all parties to the
    agreement</li>
  <li>Show the total amount lent, the rate of interest, the total amount
    payable (the cost of credit) plus any collection charges that may apply.
    The lender cannot add other charges, such as administrative or transaction
    costs.</li>
  <li>Be signed by both the lender and the customer.</li>
  <li>Notify you of your right to a ten day "cooling-off" period in which you
    can inform the lender in writing that you have decided not to proceed with
    the loan. If a moneylender and you agree that that neither wish to observe
    the ten-day cooling-off period, you must sign a separate part of the
    agreement stating that you consent to waiving your right to a cooling off
    period.</li>
</ul><p>You must also get a repayment book, separate to the lending agreement, which
states the total amount of the loan and the total number of repayments due.
Each time you make a payment the amount and date must be written into the book.
Some moneylenders issue loan statements instead of a repayment book, which set
out the same information. The moneylender must keep a record of each lending
agreement.</p>

<h3>Repayments and collection</h3>

<p>Many moneylenders collect loan payments in cash each week, and include a
collection charge for this service. (You must be given the option of paying at
the moneylender’s business premises to avoid the collection charge.) Some
money lenders allow you to pay by direct debit. </p>

<p>Any collection charges must be outlined in the lending agreement before you
sign it. If the moneylender is sending an agent to the customer's house, the
agent must have written authorisation from the moneylender to do so (generally
in the form of an ID card). The agent is only allowed to collect repayments and
cannot initiate new loans.</p>

<p>The moneylender or their agent can only call to your home from Monday to
Saturday between 10am to 9pm. If you have agreed in writing beforehand
collection can be allowed between 8am and 10am. A money lender cannot contact
you on Sundays and public holidays and they cannot contact your employer or
your family without your written permission.</p>

<p>Under <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0026/sec0011.html#zza26y1997s11">Section
11 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997</a> it is an offence
to demand payment of a debt in a way designed to alarm, distress or humiliate.
This also covers both blackmail and extortion. (Extortion means using
intimidation or the threat of violence to obtain money, information or anything
else of value from another person). Read more about <a href="../debt/debt_collection.html">debt collection</a>. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l920be">Interest</h2>

<p>A moneylender's loan will generally have a higher <a href="../savings_and_investments/comparing_interest_on_savings_and_investments.html">APR
(Annual Percentage Rate)</a> than a credit union or bank loan. The APR is at
least 23% and may be much more in some cases.</p>

<p>As with all loans, consumers should look at the total cost of the loan. That
is, the amount of extra money that has to be paid back over and above the
amount of the original loan.</p>

<p>The amount you have to pay back on a moneylending loan stays the same no
matter how long it takes to pay the loan back. This is because moneylenders are
not allowed to charge any extra interest or charges over and above what they
are licensed to charge and what they have stated they will charge at the start
of the loan.</p>

<p>Moneylenders are not allowed to offer top-up loans or a second loan to pay
off the first loan that will place the customer further in debt. Moneylenders
are also not allowed to take an amount from the overall loan and treat it as a
first repayment.</p>

<h3>Defaulting on loans</h3>

<p>If a customer fails to pay one or more instalments due under the lending
agreement, legal action may be taken by the moneylender. The moneylender must
serve the customer with a notice in writing stating that legal action will be
taken and giving an estimate of the legal costs the customer may have to pay.
The customer has 21 days after being served with the notice to pay the
instalments before legal action can be taken, although if a customer
persistently fails to pay instalments during the period of the loan, the
moneylender may get permission from the courts to waive this waiting period.</p>

<h3>Illegal or unlicensed trading</h3>

<p>It is unlawful to provide someone with moneylending services without a
moneylender's licence. The Central Bank and Irish Financial Services Regulatory
Authority Act 2003 increased the penalties on conviction of illegal trading in
moneylending to a fine of up to €63,486.90 and/or up to 5 years imprisonment.
</p>

<p>If you believe you have dealt with an illegal moneylender or know the
identity of someone you believe to be an illegal moneylender, you should
contact either the <a href="http://www.ccpc.ie/">Competition and Consumer
Protection Commission</a> or your <a href="http://www.garda.ie/Stations/Default.aspx">local Garda station</a>. Only
the Gardai can take legal action against illegal moneylenders, but the
Competition and Consumer Protection Commission can give advice on whether the
moneylender is trading illegally and how to proceed with your complaint. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>If you are experiencing difficulty in paying off a loan, you should contact
your moneylender as soon as you can. If you cannot resolve the matter directly
with your moneylender, you can get help by contacting the <a shape="rect" href="../debt/mabs_service.html">Money Advice and Budgeting Service</a>, a free
and confidential service for people in Ireland with debt or money management
problems. </p>

<p>More information about moneylending is available from the Central Bank

<p>Hire purchase is an agreement whereby a person hires goods for a period of
time by paying instalments, and can own the goods at the end of the agreement
if all instalments are paid. </p>

<p>Hire purchase agreements usually last between two and five years, the most
common last three years. Under a hire purchase agreement, <span>the consumer
does not actually own the goods until the last installment is paid</span>,
although he or she has full use of the goods throughout the repayment period.
</p>

<p>Hire purchase agreements can be held with banks, building societies, finance
companies and certain retail stores, for example, garages. The store or garage
is not actually providing the loan. It is acting as an agent for a finance
company and earns commission from the finance company for arranging the loan.
</p>

<p>It is advisable to read a hire purchase contract very carefully before
committing yourself to any agreement. </p>

<h3>How does a hire purchase agreement work?</h3>

<p>A hire purchase agreement is drawn up and signed by the hirer (the consumer)
and on behalf of the owner (the lending institution). If there is a retailer
involved, e.g., a garage, it also signs the agreement and supplies the goods in
question. </p>

<p>Most of the car loans offered by garages are hire purchase loans. Consumers
can also be offered hire purchase loans when buying furniture, computer
equipment or electrical goods. </p>

<p>The hire purchase agreement states: </p>
<ul><li>The goods the agreement refers to, for example, a car or computer. </li>
  <li>The cash price of the goods </li>
  <li>The hire purchase price, which is the total sum payable over the life of
    the loan in order to complete the purchase of the goods. The hire purchase
    price is therefore the monthly payment or installment multiplied by the
    number of installments which have to be made. </li>
  <li>The amount of each installment by which the hire purchase price is to be
    paid. Sometimes the last installment required to end the agreement is much
    larger than all the others. This is called a "balloon" payment and will
    have to be paid to clear the loan and allow the consumer to become the
    owner. </li>
  <li>The date each instalment is to be paid </li>
  <li>The number of installments </li>
  <li>The names and addresses of all the parties to the agreement </li>
  <li>A statement that the hirer has the right to withdraw from the agreement
    within 10 days of receiving a copy of the agreement. This is known as a
    'cooling off' period. Often consumers are asked to give away this right by
    signing a waiver. You do not have to sign this waiver in order for your
    application to be processed. Consumers should try to take some time to read
    all the terms of the agreement and to ensure they understand these fully
    before signing this or any other part of the agreement. </li>
  <li>A statement that the hirer (consumer) must inform the owner (finance
    house) as to the whereabouts of the goods to which the agreement relates
  </li>
  <li>The words "Hire Purchase Agreement" must be stated clearly and in a
    prominent position on the agreement form. </li>
  <li>The agreement must also set out the fees and penalties that apply. Some
    examples of these costs are provided below. </li>
</ul><p>Unless all of these requirements are contained in the agreement, the
agreement itself may not be enforceable. </p>

<h3>Typical fees and costs on a hire purchase agreement</h3>

<p>The fees and charges on hire purchase agreements vary, but may include:</p>
<ul><li>Documentation fees </li>
  <li>Interest surcharge for missed repayments - this means an additional
    amount of interest will be charged on the amount unpaid</li>
  <li>Penalty fees for missed or late payments </li>
  <li>Completion fee for ownership of the goods to pass to you </li>
  <li>Repossession charge - if the goods are repossessed, you will be charged
    around €300</li>
  <li>Rescheduling charge - if your lender agrees to change the loan terms </li>
</ul><p>Any balloon payment charged on a hire purchase loan - while it is not an
<em>extra charge</em> - has the effect of postponing part of the costs until
after the loan. This means that in the earlier months and years, consumers are
paying less off their loan that they would for a bank or a <a shape="rect" href="../financial_institutions/credit_unions.html">credit union</a> loan. </p>

<h3>Can a consumer terminate a hire purchase agreement? </h3>

<p>A consumer (the hirer) can terminate the agreement at any time by giving
notice in writing to the owner of the goods (the finance house). Consumers
should be aware that breaking a hire purchase contract before its normal end
date usually involves penalties. You can either:</p>
<ul><li>Return the goods to the owner and pay half the amount of the total hire
    purchase price (if the total of instalments already paid have not reached
    that amount) – this is called the <em>half-rule</em>. You do not have to
    pay half the hire purchase price immediately. A recent High Court decision
    clarified this. If you have not paid half the hire purchase price you can
    still return the goods. However, you will still owe the difference between
    the payments you have made and half the hire purchase price. Read more
    about <a href="http://www.nca.ie/nca/car-finance-debt#half-rule">the
    half-rule on the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission’s website</a>. If the goods in
    question are damaged in any way, the consumer will be liable to pay for any
    damage caused. The finance house may issue a notice of costs, but consumers
    should try to get their own estimate in such cases. </li>
  <li>Buy the goods earlier than planned. The consumer can own the goods by
    paying the difference between the amount already paid and the total hire
    purchase price. In such cases, there is usually a reduction on the overall
    amount due as the loan is being paid off earlier than planned. This
    reduction is calculated using a recognised formula for early loan
    repayments, however, the amount of any reduction is relatively small. </li>
</ul><p>Further information is available at the <a href="http://www.nca.ie/nca/car-finance">Competition and Consumer Protection Commission's
website</a>.</p>

<h3>Can the owner (finance house) repossess the goods?</h3>

<p>The finance house can only repossess the goods under certain circumstances.
If the consumer has not yet paid off one-third of the total hire purchase cost,
the owner can repossess the goods at any time without taking legal action
against the consumer. </p>

<p>However, if the consumer has paid one-third or more off the total hire
purchase cost, the owner cannot repossess the goods without taking legal
proceedings. Any deposit that is paid at the start of the agreement or the
value of any trade-in for example, is taken into account in calculating one
third of the cost. </p>

<p>If this <em>one-third rule</em> is breached by the owner, the consumer is
entitled to end the agreement and can seek a refund of all payments made. You
can read more about the <a href="http://www.nca.ie/index.jsp?a=187&amp;n=305&amp;p=145#repossessed">one-third
rule on the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission’s website</a>.</p>

<h3>What happens if the goods are faulty or damaged?</h3>

<p>Anything you buy under a hire purchase agreement must comply with the Sale
of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980 and be:</p>
<ul><li>Of merchantable quality </li>
  <li>Fit for its normal purpose, and reasonably durable </li>
  <li>As described, whether the description is part of the advertising or
    wrapping, on a label or something said by the salesperson. </li>
</ul><p>If goods hired under a hire purchase agreement are or become faulty, both
the retailer and the owner (finance company) are responsible. A consumer can
claim against either party in this situation. A claim cannot be made against
the manufacturer of the goods. </p>

<p>If a consumer returns defective goods, he or she is entitled to a refund of
any installments paid as consumer rights in this situation are the same as if
the goods were purchased outright. </p>

<p>A guarantee under a hire purchase agreement applies in the same way as if
goods were bought outright. The manufacturer makes the guarantee. If there is a
fault with the goods, the consumer can choose to have the goods repaired under
the guarantee or to seek a full refund or exchange from the owner. </p>

<p>Under a hire purchase plan the consumer has a duty to take reasonable care
of the hired goods. If the goods are damaged by the consumer and returned to
the owner or finance company they are entitled to send a bill for repairs to
the consumer. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<h3>Hire purchase costs</h3>

<p>The cost of a hire purchase agreement is the difference between the cash
price of the goods being hired and the full hire purchase price. If the cash
price of a car is €12,000 and the hire purchase price is €17,000, then the
hire purchase cost is €5,000, i.e., the extra cost involved to hire the car
for a period of time (and perhaps eventually to own it) rather than to buy it
outright for cash. </p>

<p>Different lending institutions have different hire purchase costs. Some will
quote an <a shape="rect" href="apr.html">APR (Annual Percentage Rate)</a>. This
can help consumers to compare hire purchase costs. It may be misleading to
compare a hire purchase APR with that of a normal bank or credit union loan, as
a consumer is paying for the hire of the goods and does not own them until the
last installment of the agreement has been paid.</p>

<p>Consumers who would like independent information or help in understanding
any of the terms and conditions of their hire purchase (or any other loan)
contract are encouraged to contact the <a href="http://www.nca.ie">Competition and Consumer Protection Commission</a>. Apart from information and support, the Agency will help
to ensure that any complaints are properly handled by the finance companies
they regulate.</p>

<p>You can contact their consumer help-line on lo-call 1890 432 432 or visit
their <a shape="rect" href="http://www.itsyourmoney.ie/">website</a>. </p>

<p>For specific consumer complaints against a finance company in relation to a
hire purchase agreement, consumers should address their complaint in the first
instance to the finance company. If they are not satisfied with the outcome, a
formal complaint can be made to the <a shape="rect" href="/en/consumer_affairs/consumer_protection/consumer_complaints/financial_services_ombudsman.html">Financial
Ombudsman</a>. The Ombudsman has the power to award compensation to the
consumer in cases where their rights have been breached, or where there is
evidence of unfair treatment. </p>

<p>A consumer is not obliged to accept the solution recommended by the
Ombudsman. Anyone who remains dissatisfied after pursuing these complaint
procedures is entitled to seek redress by taking legal action against the
finance company. </p>

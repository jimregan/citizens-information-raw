<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l2828e">Debts after death</h2>

<p>When you die, any debts you have must be repaid from your estate before any
other claims on the estate can be met. This is the case whether or not you have
made a will.</p>

<p>If you die and have no estate, then your debts die with you as they cannot
be repaid. Your relatives are not liable for your debts unless they have
provided personal guarantees for those debts.</p>

<p>Your creditors may sue your estate for the payment of outstanding debts.</p>

<h3>Your estate</h3>

<p>Your estate is all the property, goods and money that you own that are
available for distribution after your death. Certain property and money may not
form part of your estate at all.</p>

<h3>Family or shared home</h3>

<p>If you and your spouse or civil partner are joint owners of the <a href="../../../birth_family_relationships/separation_and_divorce/family_home.html">family
or shared home</a>, your spouse or civil partner becomes the sole owner on your
death. If there is a mortgage on the home, then your spouse or civil partner
becomes liable for that mortgage but is not liable for any of your other debts.
Your home does not form part of your estate.</p>

<p>If you are the sole owner, then your family or shared home does become part
of your estate and is available for the payment of your debts.</p>

<h3>Insurance policies </h3>

<p>Some insurance policies have a nominated beneficiary. In those cases, the
proceeds of the policy go directly to that beneficiary and do not form part of
your estate. In other cases, the proceeds of the insurance policy do form part
of your estate and are available for the payment of your debts. What happens in
any particular case depends on the terms of the policy.</p>

<h3>Credit union deposits</h3>

<p>If you were a member of a credit union, you would have nominated a person to
become entitled to up to â‚¬23,000 of your savings on your death. This does not
form part of your estate.</p>

<h3>Joint bank accounts</h3>

<p>If you have a joint bank account with another person or people, the question
of whether your share of the account forms part of the estate depends on the
intention of the account holders when the account was opened. If it was the
intention that the other account holder(s) would inherit your share, then your
share does not become part of your estate. If this was not the intention, for
example, if the account was in joint names purely for convenience, then your
share - which may be the entirely of the account - does become part of your
estate. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l8ae5d">Duty of personal representative</h2>

<p>When you die, all your assets are gathered together by your <a href="../../../death/the_deceaseds_estate/what_happens_the_deceaseds_estate.html">personal
representative</a> (your executor or administrator). The first duty of the
personal representative is to pay your funeral and other expenses and then your
debts. </p>

<p>Your estate is considered to be insolvent if you do not have enough assets
to pay your funeral and other expenses and all your debts. If you have no
assets, then the payment of your debts does not arise. If you have some assets
but they are not sufficient to cover all your debts, the debts must be paid in
a set order. If your estate is solvent, there are rules about which assets are
to be first used to pay your debts. </p>

<h3>Insolvent estate</h3>

<p>The order of priority for payments from an insolvent estate is as
follows:</p>
<ol>
  1) Funeral, testamentary and administration expenses. Testamentary and
  administration expenses are the expenses incurred in dealing with your
  estate; 2) Creditors who have security, for example, mortgage providers; 3)
  Preferential debts - these are mainly taxes and social insurance
  contributions; 4) Ordinary debts.</ol><h3>If your estate is solvent but not sufficient</h3>

<p>If your estate is solvent, then, again, your funeral and other expenses and
your debts must be paid first. If you die <a href="../../../death/before_a_death/making_a_will.html">intestate</a>, the
rest of your estate is then divided in accordance with the rules on
intestacy.</p>

<p>If you have made a will and your estate is not sufficient to cover your
debts and all the bequests which you have made, then the debts are paid from
the following assets and in this order:</p>
<ol>
  1) Property which you did not deal with in the will (that is, property which
  would be distributed in accordance with the rules on intestacy); 2) The
  residue - this is the amount left over when specific bequests are dealt with;
  3) Property specifically appropriated for the payment of debts; 4) Property
  charged with the payment of debts; 5) Pecuniary legacies - these are bequests
  of money as distinct from property or goods; 6) Other bequests.</ol><p>When making your will, you may specify a different order for the payment of
your debts.</p>

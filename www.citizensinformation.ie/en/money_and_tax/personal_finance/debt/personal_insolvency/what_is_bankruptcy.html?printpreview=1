<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Bankruptcy is a settlement of the debts of someone who is wholly or
partially unable to repay their debts. It deals with both secured and unsecured
debt.</p>

<p>The purpose of the bankruptcy is to distribute your assets fairly among your
creditors and protect you from these creditors. The distribution is done
through a court official, the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy, who is based in
the <a href="insolvency_service_of_ireland.html">Insolvency Service of
Ireland (ISI)</a> and manages its Bankruptcy Division.</p>

<h3>Changes in 2016</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=30407&amp;&amp;CatID=59">Bankruptcy
(Amendment) Act 2015</a>, which was signed into law on 25 December 2015,
provides for several changes to the rules on bankruptcy. It includes the
following provisions, which <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR16000042">came into effect on 29
January 2016</a>:</p>
<ul><li>Reducing the normal duration of bankruptcy from 3 years to 1 year (up to
    December 2013 it was 12 years)</li>
  <li>Returning ownership of the bankrupt person’s home to them after 3 years
    (subject to any outstanding mortgage) unless it must be sold to pay
    creditors</li>
  <li>Reducing the maximum duration of bankruptcy payment orders from 5 years
    to 3 years, except in cases of non-co-operation or concealment of
  assets</li>
  <li>Extending the duration of bankruptcy in cases of non-co-operation or
    concealment</li>
  <li>Streamlining and clarifying the processes</li>
</ul><p>Provisions to remove the requirement for a statutory sitting of the High
Court came into effect on 1 June 2016.</p>

<p>There are transitional provisions for people who are already in
bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Read more about the changes on <a href="http://isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Press_Release_29_Jan_2016.pdf/Files/Press_Release_29_Jan_2016.pdf">isi.gov.ie

</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lb45ce">Before becoming bankrupt</h2>

<p>If you are in serious financial difficulties, you may decide that declaring
bankruptcy is the best solution for you. The ISI has published <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/New_Bankruptcy">detailed information
on bankruptcy</a>, a <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Bankruptcy_Guide_Jan_2016.pdf/Files/Bankruptcy_Guide_Jan_2016.pdf">debtor’s
guide (pdf)</a> and a set of <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Bankruptcy_Scenarios_Oct_2014.pdf/Files/Bankruptcy_Scenarios_Oct_2014.pdf">scenarios
(pdf)</a>. Its backontrack.ie website also has user-friendly <a href="http://backontrack.ie/bankruptcy">information and guides on
bankruptcy</a>. </p>

<p>The <a href="mabs_service.html">Money Advice and Budgeting Service</a>
(MABS) recommends that anyone thinking of applying for bankruptcy should <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/personal-insolvency/personal-insolvency-faqs/bankruptcy-faqs/bankruptcy-what-is-bankruptcy/">seek
legal advice</a>. The ISI also recommends anyone who is in doubt in relation to
their legal or financial position to take appropriate professional advice.</p>

<p>A creditor can petition for bankruptcy against you if you have committed an
<em>act of bankruptcy</em> within the previous 3 months. This is known as a
<em>creditor’s petition</em>. </p>

<p>Examples of acts of bankruptcy are:</p>
<ul><li>If you fail to comply with a bankruptcy summons requesting payment of a
    specific sum due, within 14 days from service of the summons on you</li>
  <li>If the sheriff or county registrar makes a return of 'no goods' in
    respect of you - this is the return made by a sheriff to an order
    authorising him to seize the goods of a person when he has been unable to
    find any goods to seize</li>
</ul><p>The <a href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_options.html#l28ba8">Personal
Insolvency Act 2012</a> introduced two additional acts of bankruptcy:</p>
<ul><li>Where the debtor has been subject to a <a href="debt_settlement_arrangements.html">Debt Settlement Arrangement</a>
    which has been terminated or which is deemed to have failed</li>
  <li>Where the debtor has been subject to a <a href="personal_insolvency_arrangements.html">Personal Insolvency
    Arrangement</a> which has been terminated or which has failed</li>
</ul><p>The ISI has published <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/WP13000223">information for
creditors</a>.</p>

<h3>What alternatives are there?</h3>

<p>You may be eligible for one of the 3 debt resolution processes introduced
under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 – read more in our document on <a href="personal_insolvency_options.html">personal insolvency options</a>. </p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l3a215">Bankruptcy process and outcomes</h2>

<p>There are several steps you must take when you have decided (alone or with
professional advice) to make yourself bankrupt. While instructing a <a href="../../../../justice/courtroom/solicitors.html">solicitor</a> is not
necessary, the ISI considers it advisable to get professional legal advice in
advance of declaring yourself bankrupt or defending any bankruptcy proceedings.
The <a href="https://www.mortgageholders.ie/bankruptcy/">Irish Mortgage Holders
Organisation (IMHO)</a> provides a free service (excluding Official Assignee
and court administration costs) in relation to bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The ISI’s website has the <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/BankruptcyDocuments">forms that you
need to apply for bankruptcy</a>, along with <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Bankruptcy_forms_notes_Oct_14.pdf/Files/Bankruptcy_forms_notes_Oct_14.pdf">detailed
notes on the application process (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>The process is summarised below:</p>
<ul><li>Lodge €200 with the Official Assignee</li>
  <li>Complete your petition, which must be verified by a sworn affidavit and a
    sworn statement of affairs</li>
  <li>Get the above documents stamped at a <a href="http://www.courts.ie/offices.nsf/webcobycounty?OpenView">court Stamp
    Office</a></li>
  <li>File the stamped documents and statement of affairs at the <a href="http://www.courts.ie/offices.nsf/6501643ba9c14a9680256e43003d68a4/3abd4f30c15c0c6180256f34002ace4b?OpenDocument">Examiner’s
    Office</a> and get a court date</li>
  <li>Attend the court hearing on that date, where the judge, if satisfied,
    will adjudicate you bankrupt</li>
  <li>Meet the Official Assignee or Bankruptcy Inspector to be interviewed
    about all your assets and debts</li>
  <li>Place a notice of your adjudication as a bankrupt in <a href="http://www.irisoifigiuil.ie/">Iris Oifigiúil</a> (the State gazette)
  </li>
  <li>Place a notice of your adjudication as a bankrupt either on the ISI’s
    website or in a national daily newspaper </li>
</ul><p>Before 1 June 2016 a statutory High Court sitting was also required, but
this requirement was removed by the Bankruptcy (Amendment) Act 2015.</p>

<h3>What happens when you are declared bankrupt?</h3>

<p>A Bankruptcy Inspector from the ISI will serve you with a copy of the Order
of Adjudication (Bankruptcy Order) and Warrant of Seizure. The Inspector will
also give you a form to complete, requesting various details, which the ISI
will use to contact you and process your bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Your bank accounts will be frozen, except for one current account in which
you can keep a balance of up to €1,000 for general living expenses.</p>

<p>The ISI will contact all financial institutions and inform them that you
have been made bankrupt.</p>

<p>As soon as your bankruptcy starts, you are free of debt. The Official
Assignee now owns your assets and administers your estate. Your creditors can
no longer seek repayment directly from you. They must deal directly with the
Official Assignee and all correspondence should be forwarded to him.</p>

<p>You must contribute any surplus income to the Official Assignee.</p>

<p>Your name will appear in the Bankruptcy Register, which is kept in the <a href="http://www.courts.ie/offices.nsf/6501643ba9c14a9680256e43003d68a4/3abd4f30c15c0c6180256f34002ace4b?OpenDocument">Office

you are made bankrupt (pdf)</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Income</strong></p>

<p>The Official Assignee will negotiate an Income Payment Agreement or seek an
Income Payment Order for the surplus of your income over the reasonable living
expenses for your situation, based on <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/RLE_calculated">the ISI’s
guidelines</a>. The agreement or order will last up to 3 years. (The Bankruptcy
(Amendment) Act 2015 reduced this period from 5 years, with effect from 29
January 2016.)</p>

<p>No deductions will be made from social welfare payments.</p>

bankruptcy affects your income</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Assets</strong></p>

<p>All of your assets, with the exception of necessities up to a value of
€6,000, are transferred to the Official Assignee, who will sell them. </p>

<p>You are entitled to retain the following as 'excluded items' from bankruptcy
to a value of €6,000, although you may apply to the court to increase that
figure:</p>
<ul><li>Clothes</li>
  <li>Furniture and tools or equipment relating to trade</li>
  <li>Necessities for your family and any dependent relatives living with
  you</li>
</ul><p>Once your assets are sold, the Official Assignee will pay costs, expenses,
fees and certain priority debts, such as taxes, and distribute the remainder
among your creditors.</p>

<p>If you acquire assets after the date when you are made bankrupt (for
example, through inheritance) the Official Assignee can claim them and sell
them for the benefit of your creditors.</p>

<p>If you own a family home, by yourself or with another person, the Official
Assignee may only sell it with the prior permission of the court. Where this
permission is sought, the court will balance the interests of your creditors
against the interests of your family and may decide to postpone the sale of
your home.</p>

<p>If you hold property jointly (for example, with your spouse) your bankruptcy
will cause the joint ownership to be split between the Official Assignee and
your non-bankrupt co-owner. </p>

<p>The Bankruptcy (Amendment) Act 2015 provides for ownership of your home to
be re-vested in you, subject to any outstanding mortgage, 3 years after you
have been adjudicated bankrupt (with some exceptions). This change came into
effect on 29 January 2016.</p>

<h3>Restrictions on people who have been declared bankrupt</h3>

<p>Once you have been declared bankrupt, you will be guilty of an offence
if:</p>
<ul><li>You do not disclose the bankruptcy when getting a loan or any other
    credit facility of €650 or more</li>
  <li>When trading in a name other than that in which you were made bankrupt,
    you do not disclose the bankruptcy</li>
  <li>You act as a director, manager, auditor, liquidator or receiver of a
    company without permission of the court</li>
</ul><p>These offences carry a maximum penalty of 5 years in prison and a fine of
€1,270.</p>

<p><strong>Other consequences of bankruptcy are:</strong> </p>
<ul><li>If you wish to travel outside the State, you should tell the Official
    Assignee. You may be arrested if it seems to the High Court that you are
    leaving the State in order to avoid the consequences of your
  bankruptcy.</li>
  <li>You cannot be granted an <strong>enduring</strong> <a href="../../../../death/before_a_death/power_of_attorney.html">power of
    attorney</a> on behalf of someone else, and if you hold one already, it is
    automatically revoked if you become bankrupt.</li>
  <li>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0006/print.html">Charities
    Act 2009</a>, you may not be a trustee of a charity if you are adjudicated
    bankrupt.</li>
  <li>Some professional bodies disqualify members who are adjudicated bankrupt
  </li>
</ul><h3>Cross-border recognition</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2000:160:0001:0018:en:PDF">EU
Insolvency Regulation (pdf)</a> aims to simplify formalities governing the
reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in cross-border insolvency
matters.</p>

<p>The Regulation designates bankruptcy as an insolvency proceeding which can
benefit from cross-border recognition. This means that a debtor availing of
bankruptcy will gain the same protection against creditors in most other EU
countries that they receive in Ireland, subject to and in accordance with the
Insolvency Regulation.</p>

<p>(The 3 processes introduced by the Personal Insolvency Act also come under
this Regulation.)</p>

<h3>Discharge from bankruptcy</h3>

<p>You are automatically discharged from bankruptcy 1 year (formerly 3 years)
after the order of adjudication. Your name will remain on the register, as a
discharged bankrupt. If there is an Income Payment Agreement or an Income
Payment Order in place, you will still have to comply with it until it expires.
These arrangements can last up to 3 years (formerly 5 years). </p>

<p>You can also be discharged from bankruptcy if you meet certain conditions,
as follows: </p>

<p>If your assets have been sold and all your costs, fees, expenses and
preferential debts (such as certain tax debts) have been paid, it is possible
for you to be discharged from bankruptcy even if you have not paid all of your
debts.</p>

<p>You can be released from bankruptcy in any of the following ways:</p>
<ol><li>If your creditors have been paid in full</li>
  <li>If all of your unsecured creditors give their consent</li>
  <li>After agreeing and paying a settlement with at least 60% of your
    unsecured creditors (called an Offer of Composition)</li>
  <li>Automatically after 1 year (formerly 3 years) as noted above</li>
</ol><p>When you are discharged from bankruptcy on grounds 1 to 3 above, any money
or property remaining in your estate is returned to you, provided all the
costs, court fees, expenses and preferential debts of bankruptcy are paid. </p>

<p>If you are automatically discharged after the end of the normal bankruptcy
term without having satisfied your creditors on grounds 1 to 3 above, after
discharge all your assets continue to vest in the Official Assignee for payment
of all your debts, costs, fees and expenses in bankruptcy.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>A Debt Relief Notice (DRN) is one of 3 debt resolution mechanisms introduced
under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0044/index.html">Personal
Insolvency Act 2012</a> for people who cannot afford to pay their personal
debts. These arrangements offer different solutions to people in different
situations.</p>

<p>The Debt Relief Notice is designed for people who have very low disposable
income or assets. It allows for the write-off of qualifying debt up to a
certain limit, subject to a 3-year supervision period. This upper limit was
originally €20,000. Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/32/enacted/en/html">Personal
Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015</a> the limit has increased to €35,000 <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR15000501">with effect from 29
September 2015</a>. </p>

<p>This document describes how to qualify for a DRN and how the process
works.</p>

<p>The Insolvency Service of Ireland has published <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/DRN">information about Debt Relief
Notices</a>, including FAQs, a guidebook and a <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/Possible_Scenarios_DRN">set of
possible scenarios</a>. It also provides <a href="http://backontrack.ie/drn">extra information on DRNs</a>, including a <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Backontrack_DRN.pdf/Files/Backontrack_DRN.pdf">quick
guide (pdf)</a> on its website <a href="http://backontrack.ie/">backontrack.ie</a>, aimed at people who are
struggling with debt.</p>

options</a> here.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l9d7ad">Am I eligible?</h2>

<p>A Debt Relief Notice deals with qualifying debts of up to €35,000 in the
case of people who have very low disposable income or assets and no prospect of
being able to pay off their debts in the next 3 years. (As noted above, this
upper limit has recently increased from €20,000.)</p>

<p>You can only avail of a DRN once in your lifetime. You cannot get a DRN if
you are involved in one of the other new debt resolution processes, or in the
<a href="what_is_bankruptcy.html">bankruptcy</a> process, or if you have
completed such a process within the last 5 years.</p>

<h3>Qualifying debts</h3>

<p>In general, you will only qualify for a DRN if all of your debts are
unsecured (apart from exceptional cases, outlined below) and if the total of
your debt to all your creditors adds up to €35,000 or less. (Under the
Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015, <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR15000501">this limit was
increased</a> from €20,000 with effect from 29 September 2015.)</p>

<p><strong>Unsecured debts</strong></p>

<p>A Debt Relief Notice is mainly designed to cover <em>unsecured</em> debts
(though it can include some secured debts – see below) so it is important to
know whether your debts are secured or not.</p>

<p>In general, debts such as the following are unsecured:</p>
<ul><li>Utility bill arrears (gas, electricity etc.)</li>
  <li>Rent arrears</li>
  <li>Credit card debt</li>
  <li>Store card debt</li>
  <li>Bank overdrafts</li>
  <li>Unsecured bank loans</li>
</ul><p>However, if they are rolled up into your mortgage, they become secured
loans.</p>

<p><strong>Secured debts</strong></p>

<p>A <em>secured</em> debt is a loan on which property or goods are available
as security against non-payment. Mortgages and car loans are the most common
secured loans. (If you have this type of debt, you cannot get a DRN but you may
apply for another personal insolvency option.)</p>

<p>However, while a DRN will not cover mortgages or similar large-scale secured
debt, in certain exceptional cases a loan may be secured against a small item
of property, such as a ring. Such a secured debt can be included in a DRN, but
only if the creditor agrees.</p>

<h3>Excluded and excludable debts</h3>

<p>The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 specifies certain types of debt that
<strong>cannot</strong> be written off by a Debt Relief Notice. These are
called <em>excluded</em> debts.</p>

<p>The Act specifies certain other types of debt to be <em>excludable</em> from
a DRN. This means that they can only be covered by the DRN if the creditor is
asked and agrees to let them be included – in which case they become
<em>permitted</em> debts – debts that the creditor permits to be covered.
Most types of excludable debts are those owed to the State.</p>

<p>The types of debt that are <em>excluded</em> are:</p>
<ul><li>Debts under family law orders, such as <a href="../../../../birth_family_relationships/separation_and_divorce/maintenance_orders_and_agreements.html">maintenance
    orders</a> for spouses and children</li>
  <li>Debts due under court awards for personal injury or death</li>
  <li>Debts arising from a loan (or forbearance of a loan) obtained through
    fraud or similar wrongdoing</li>
  <li>Debts arising under court orders made under the Proceeds of Crime Acts or
    fines imposed by the courts for criminal offences</li>
</ul><p>The types of debt that are <em>excludable</em> are:</p>
<ul><li>Taxes, duties or levies owed to the State, such as income tax, the <a href="../../../tax/housing_taxes_and_reliefs/local_property_tax.html">Local
    Property Tax</a>, <a href="../../../tax/duties_and_vat/value_added_tax.html">VAT</a>, capital
    taxes</li>
  <li>Service charges owed to local authorities</li>
  <li><a href="../../../../housing/owning_a_home/home_owners/household_charge.html">Household
    Charge</a></li>
  <li>Rates</li>
  <li>Money owed under the <a href="../../../../health/health_services_for_older_people/nursing_homes_support_scheme_1.html">Nursing
    Homes Support Scheme</a> (in respect of a loan advanced by the HSE to a
    nursing home resident to cover the amount due from the principal private
    residence)</li>
  <li>Money owed to the Department of Social Protection</li>
  <li>Debts due to <a href="../../../../housing/owning_a_home/home_owners/management_companies_for_apartment_blocks.html">owners’
    management companies</a> in respect of annual service charges or
    contributions due for multi-unit developments (this is the only non-State
    debt in this category) </li>
</ul><h3>Income and asset tests</h3>

<p>All of your income will be taken into account, except for <a href="../../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/child_benefit.html">Child
Benefit</a>. Any assets that you have will also be valued.</p>

<p><strong>Income</strong></p>

<p>You will only qualify for a DRN if, after deducting certain outgoings, you
would be left with a net monthly disposable income of €60 or less. The 2
types of outgoings are:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Payments in respect of debts that are outside the DRN
    process</strong> – these are either <em>excluded</em> debts that cannot
    be covered, or <em>excludable</em> debts that the creditor has not agreed
    to include, as outlined above</li>
  <li><strong>Reasonable living expenses</strong>, which will be assessed in
    accordance with detailed guidelines – see below</li>
</ul><p>Your net disposable income takes account of your income from salary, wages,
pensions and contributions from other household members. Any other income
available to you is also taken into account – including all social welfare
payments except Child Benefit.</p>

<p>Deductions are then made for:</p>
<ul><li>Income tax, PRSI and other charges/levies on income (such as <a href="../../../tax/income_tax/universal_social_charge.html">Universal
    Social Charge</a>)</li>
  <li>Payments that you make in respect of excluded debts and excludable debts
    (unless they are <em>permitted</em> debts – see ‘Excluded and
    excludable debts’ above)</li>
  <li>Reasonable living expenses - see below</li>
</ul><p><strong>Assets</strong></p>

<p>The total value of your assets must be €400 or less. They are assessed at
market value and include savings, shares and property. The following assets are
not taken into account:</p>
<ul><li>Essential household equipment and appliances and books, tools or
    equipment needed for employment or business, up to a total value of
  €6,000</li>
  <li>Books or equipment that are reasonably necessary to enable you or a
    dependant to participate in and complete a course of education (at primary
    or secondary level only)</li>
  <li>A vehicle that has been adapted for a person with a disability (either
    you or one of your dependants)</li>
  <li>A motor vehicle up to a value of €2,000 *</li>
  <li>One item of personal jewellery to a maximum value of €750 *</li>
  <li>Any future pension entitlement or option that you cannot choose to access
    at present</li>
</ul><p>* A motor vehicle or piece of jewellery cannot be excluded from the asset
test if the cost of buying it forms part of your qualifying debts.</p>

<p><strong>Reasonable standard of living/living expenses</strong></p>

<p>You must be left with enough income to maintain a reasonable standard of
living for yourself and your dependants.</p>

<p>The <a href="insolvency_service_of_ireland.html">Insolvency Service of
Ireland (ISI)</a> is responsible for drawing up <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/RLE_calculated">guidelines on what
constitutes a reasonable standard of living and reasonable living expenses</a>.
The guidelines provide examples of what may and may not be allowed as
reasonable living expenses. They are reviewed every year.</p>

<p>You can use the ISI's <a href="http://backontrack.ie/RLE-Calculator/">reasonable living expenses
calculator</a> to find out what your household's monthly expenses would be
assessed at. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="le51b7">How does a Debt Relief Notice work?</h2>

<h3>Effects on debtors</h3>

<p>If a DRN is issued for you, it will allow for the write-off of your
qualifying debt up to €35,000 (formerly €20,000) subject to a 3-year
supervision period. You will still be liable for any excluded debts and for any
excludable debts that your creditors have not agreed to include in the DRN -
see ‘Excluded and excludable debts’ above.</p>

<p>During the supervision period, you may not get credit of €650 or more from
any source, either on your own or as part of a joint application with someone
else, without informing that source that you have a Debt Relief Notice.</p>

<p>You will have to tell the Insolvency Service of any change in your
circumstances, for example, any increases in income, assets or liabilities. If
your financial position improves above certain limits, you will have to repay
part of your debts – see ‘Paying part of your debts’ below.</p>

<p>You will also have to tell the ISI if you become aware of any errors or
omissions in the documentation included in your application for the DRN. The
ISI has extensive powers of investigation of anything that it considers
relevant to your case.</p>

<p>The Circuit Court may extend the supervision period in certain circumstances
– see ‘Extension or unsuccessful ending of a DRN’ below.</p>

<p>Details of your DRN will be placed on a public <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/WP13000125">Register of Debt Relief
Notices</a>. </p>

<h3>Effects on creditors</h3>

<p>The issue of the DRN will be the first official notification to your
creditors that you have applied to have your debts written off – except for
creditors with excludable debts, who will have to be consulted about having
their debts included as permitted debts. Your other creditors can object on
certain specified grounds when they receive the DRN – see ‘Objections’
below.</p>

<p>During the supervision period, your creditors will not be allowed to pursue
any action against you for the recovery of debts covered by the DRN. This means
that your creditors may not:</p>
<ul><li>Initiate or prosecute legal proceedings or</li>
  <li>Seek to recover payment for a debt or recover goods or</li>
  <li>Execute or <a href="../enforcement_of_judgments.html">enforce a
    judgment</a> in respect of a debt</li>
  <li>Contact you</li>
</ul><p>However, if any of your debts were guaranteed by another person, the
creditor may take action against that person.</p>

<p><strong>Objections</strong></p>

<p>Any of your creditors may apply to the Circuit Court if they object to the
inclusion of the debts you owe them in the Debt Relief Notice.</p>

<p>They can only object on the following grounds:</p>
<ul><li>You do not meet the eligibility conditions for a DRN</li>
  <li>Inaccuracies in the documentation on which your application was based</li>
  <li>You have failed to inform the Insolvency Service of changed circumstances
    or failed to surrender extra income as required</li>
  <li>You are an undischarged bankrupt</li>
  <li>You have committed an offence under the Personal Insolvency legislation
    since the DRN came into effect</li>
  <li>The procedural requirements were not followed</li>
  <li>In the 6 months before applying for the DRN, you had arranged your
    financial affairs primarily with a view to becoming eligible for a DRN</li>
</ul><p>The Court has the power to make various decisions, including extension or
termination of the DRN. The ISI may apply to the Court for withdrawal of the
notice on similar grounds and with similar consequences – see ‘Extension or
unsuccessful ending of a DRN’ below.</p>

<h3>Paying part of your debts</h3>

<p>If your financial situation improves to a certain extent during the 3-year
supervision period, you will have to repay part of your debts.</p>
<ul><li>If you get a gift or windfall payment worth €500 or more, you must
    surrender half of it to the Insolvency Service</li>
  <li>If your net income (after tax, PRSI and Universal Social Charge)
    increases by €400 or more per month, you must surrender half of that
    increase to the ISI as well</li>
</ul><p>Any amounts surrendered to the Insolvency Service will be distributed to the
relevant creditors in proportion to the size of the debts that you owe to each
creditor.</p>

<p>If you manage to repay half of the total debts covered by the Debt Relief
Notice, then you no longer have to pay any further money and the DRN will end
successfully.</p>

<h3>Debt Relief Certificate</h3>

<p>At the end of the supervision period (or if you have managed to pay 50% or
more of your debts) the Debt Relief Notice will cease to have effect. You will
be discharged from the debts it covered and any interest or penalties on those
debts. All of the information about your DRN will be removed from the public
Register of Debt Relief Notices and you will be given a Debt Relief
Certificate, confirming that you have been discharged from the relevant debts.
The ISI will also write to all the creditors concerned, to tell them that the
Debt Relief Notice has been removed from the Register.</p>

<h3>Extension or unsuccessful ending of a DRN</h3>

<p>In certain circumstances, the Debt Relief Notice may be amended or
terminated, enforcement orders may be issued, or the supervision period may be
extended. The main situations in which this can happen are:</p>
<ul><li>If the ISI concludes that you have failed to disclose an improvement in
    your financial position during the supervision period, the Circuit Court
    can make an order for enforcement, extend the period of the DRN, amend the
    DRN or make other orders or directions.</li>
  <li>If you or one of your creditors are aggrieved by something the Insolvency
    Service has done (or not done) and apply to the Circuit Court, the court
    may decide to revoke a decision of the ISI or make an order as above.</li>
  <li>If it turns out that you have given incomplete or false information, were
    not originally eligible for a DRN, have failed to surrender money to the
    ISI (50% of increased income or lump sum) or are otherwise in breach of
    your DRN obligations, the court can make orders as above or can decide to
    terminate the DRN.</li>
  <li>The DRN can also be terminated if, in the 6 months before applying for
    it, you had arranged your financial affairs primarily with a view to
    becoming eligible for a DRN</li>
</ul><p>If your Debt Relief Notice is terminated by the Court, you will be liable to
pay all the unpaid debts that it had covered (unless the Court orders
otherwise) along with any arrears, charges and interest that built up during
the supervision period.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l7a6c8">How do I get a Debt Relief Notice?</h2>

<p>You must apply through an Approved Intermediary (AI) – see <a href="debt_relief_notices.en.html#ld1a9a">How to apply</a> below. </p>

<p>You must disclose all details of your financial affairs to the AI, who will
then advise you whether or not you meet the conditions for a DRN, the
consequences, and any alternative options.</p>

<p>If you decide go ahead and apply for a DRN, you must confirm your intention
in writing.</p>

<h3>Providing information</h3>

<p>You will have to complete a Prescribed Financial Statement (PFS), giving
full and honest information about your financial circumstances. You must act in
good faith and co-operate fully with the process.</p>

<p>You will have to allow access to certain personal data held by banks and
other financial institutions so that your financial situation can be verified.
Government departments and agencies will have the power to release certain
information about you.</p>

<p>The AI will help you to complete the Prescribed Financial Statement and will
then process your application if they consider that:</p>
<ul><li>You meet the eligibility conditions</li>
  <li>The information in your PFS is complete and accurate in all material
    respects - you must confirm this by making a statutory declaration **</li>
</ul><p>** A statutory declaration is a solemn statement which must be signed in the
presence of someone who is authorised to witness statutory declarations –
such as a practising solicitor, a Peace Commissioner, a notary public or a
Commissioner for Oaths.</p>

<h3>Fees</h3>

<p>The ISI has published detailed <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/Fees">information on fees</a>. It has
waived its own fees for the 3 debt solutions, <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/si/459/made/en/print">originally
until the end of 2015</a>, and has <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/si/620/made/en/pdf">extended this
waiver to the end of 2017 (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>A fee of €100 was payable to the ISI for applying for a DRN.</p>

<h3>Next steps</h3>

<p>When the AI is satisfied that you are eligible for a Debt Relief Notice and
that all the information you have provided is complete and accurate, they will
sign a statement saying so. The AI will then transmit your application,
including all the details of your financial affairs and your debts, to the
Insolvency Service to have a DRN approved.</p>

<p>When considering your application, the Insolvency Service can ask the AI for
further information and will also have power to enquire into anything it
considers relevant to verify the completeness and accuracy of your application.
It can request information about your bank accounts, assets, liabilities,
employment and income, and the Act states that anyone asked for such
information (your bank, employer etc.) “shall furnish the information
requested as soon as practicable”.</p>

<p>Government departments, the Revenue Commissioners and other State bodies can
also provide relevant information to the ISI about your financial
circumstances.</p>

<p>If the ISI considers that the application is in order, it will issue a
certificate to that effect and notify the Circuit Court. The court will review
the application and documentation and, if satisfied that the conditions are
met, will issue a Debt Relief Notice.</p>

<p>The Court will notify the Insolvency Service, the AI, yourself and the
relevant creditor(s) of the DRN. The DRN will relate to specific debts and
specific creditors. You may well have other debts that are not covered by the
DRN and those creditors are not affected by it. The Insolvency Service will
publish details of the DRN on the <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/Register_of_Debt_Relief_Notices">Register
of Debt Relief Notices</a>, which is accessible to the public.</p>

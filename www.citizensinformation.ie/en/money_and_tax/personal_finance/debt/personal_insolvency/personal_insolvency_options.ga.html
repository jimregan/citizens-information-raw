<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>In the past, if you were insolvent – that is, you were unable to pay your
debts or meet your liabilities – bankruptcy was the only formal mechanism
available for you to settle your debts and get protection from your creditors.
</p>

<p>Three new debt resolution mechanisms were introduced under the <a href="personal_insolvency_options.en.html#l28ba8">Personal Insolvency Act
2012</a> for people who cannot afford to pay their personal and mortgage debts.
<a href="personal_insolvency_options.en.html#l6930a">The Insolvency Service of
Ireland (ISI)</a> administers these debt resolution processes. The ISI has a
website <a href="http://backontrack.ie/">backontrack.ie</a>, aimed at people
who are struggling with debt.</p>

<p>The rules on bankruptcy have also changed and the Official Assignee in
Bankruptcy is now based within the ISI. Read more in our document on <a href="what_is_bankruptcy.html">bankruptcy</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/Media_&amp;_Statistics">Statistics</a>
on the operation of all the above processes are published on the ISI’s main
website <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/">isi.gov.ie</a>. </p>

<h3>Measures to support people in mortgage arrears</h3>

<p>A series of measures <a href="http://www.merrionstreet.ie/MerrionStreet/en/News-Room/Releases/Government_Strengthens_Framework_to_Support_Mortgage_Holders_in_Arrears.html">announced
on 13 May 2015</a> included changes to the personal insolvency system. <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR15000598">All of these changes are
now in effect.</a> They include court review where a mortgage lender rejects
the borrower’s personal insolvency proposal.</p>

<p>As part of <a href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/news/2016/news20161003.html">Abhaile,
the national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service</a>, a new <a href="../../../../housing/owning_a_home/mortgage_arrears/aid_and_advice_scheme.html">aid
and advice scheme</a> for people in serious mortgage arrears covers free legal
representation for eligible borrowers in seeking such a court review. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l98c04">Personal insolvency legislation </h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0044/index.html">Personal
Insolvency Act 2012</a> became law in December 2012. The Act was amended by
Part 7 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/act/pub/0032/index.html">Courts
and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013</a>. A series of Statutory
Instruments was made in order to bring the various sections into effect and
implement the personal insolvency system. Further amendments were made by the
<a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/act/pub/0046/index.html">Companies
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013</a> and the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/32/enacted/en/html">Personal
Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015</a>. </p>

<p>The Law Reform Commission has prepared a <a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/en_act_2012_0044.PDF">consolidation
of the Personal Insolvency Act (pdf)</a>. </p>

<p>The Act introduced 3 new debt resolution mechanisms to help mortgage-holders
and other people with unsustainable debt to reach agreements with their
creditors. These mechanisms offer different solutions to people in different
situations.</p>

<p>One important issue is whether your debts are secured or not. A
<em>secured</em> debt is a loan on which property or goods are available as
security against non-payment. Mortgages are the most common secured loans. In
general, debts such as bank loans and credit card debt are unsecured, but if
they are rolled up into your mortgage, they become secured loans. </p>

<p>The mechanisms introduced by the Personal Insolvency Act are:</p>
<ul><li>A Debt Relief Notice (DRN) to allow for the write-off of debt
    (<strong>generally unsecured and in some cases secured</strong>) up to a
    certain limit, subject to a 3-year supervision period. This upper limit was
    originally €20,000 but was increased to €35,000 <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR15000501">with effect from 29
    September 2015</a>. </li>
  <li>A Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA) for the agreed settlement of
    <strong>unsecured</strong> debt, with no limit involved, normally over 5
    years</li>
  <li>A Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) for the agreed settlement of
    <strong>secured</strong> debt up to €3 million (though this cap can be
    increased) and <strong>unsecured</strong> debt, with no limit involved,
    normally over 6 years</li>
</ul><p>These mechanisms are described in more detail below.</p>

<p>The Act also introduced automatic discharge from bankruptcy, subject to
certain conditions, after 3 years as opposed to 12 years previously. <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR16000042">This period was later
reduced to 1 year</a>. </p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="lcb0d2">Mechanisms introduced by the Personal
Insolvency Act </h2>

<p>Each of these debt resolution mechanisms has its own rules and procedures
but the following main rules apply to all of them:</p>

<p><strong>Limits on usage</strong></p>

<p>You can be involved in only one of the 3 mechanisms (DRN, DSA or PIA) or in
the bankruptcy process at any one time. If you use one of these 4 processes,
you will generally have to wait some years before applying to use another.</p>

<p>You may use each of the 3 mechanisms only once in your lifetime. (There is
no such limit on bankruptcy but it would be rare for anyone to go bankrupt
twice.)</p>

<p><strong>Running up debts</strong></p>

<p>You must not deliberately stop paying (or underpay) your creditors while
these procedures are being set up as this may cause your application to be
ineligible.</p>

<p><strong>Provision of information</strong></p>

<p>You will have to complete a Prescribed Financial Statement, giving full and
honest information about your financial circumstances. The required information
is specified in <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Personal%20Insolvency%20Act.pdf/Files/Personal%20Insolvency%20Act.pdf">these
Regulations (pdf)</a>. You will have to sign a Statutory Declaration to this
effect. You must act in good faith and co-operate fully with the process.</p>

<p>You will have to give your written consent to the accessing of certain
personal data held by banks and other financial institutions so that your
financial situation can be verified. Government departments and agencies will
have the power to release certain information about you.</p>

<p><strong>Public registers</strong></p>

<p>If you use any of these 3 mechanisms, your name and details will be
published on a <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/Registers">register</a>, which is
accessible to the public. The success or failure of the process will also be
recorded.</p>

<p><strong>EU Insolvency Regulation</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/COUNCIL%20IMPLEMENTING%20REGULATION%20(EU)%20No%20663%20of%202014.pdf/Files/COUNCIL%20IMPLEMENTING%20REGULATION%20(EU)%20No%20663%20of%202014.pdf">Regulation

in cross-border insolvency matters.</p>

<p>The updated Insolvency Regulation designates the DRN, DSA and PIA as
insolvency proceedings that can benefit from cross-border recognition. This
means that a debtor availing of a DRN, DSA or PIA will gain the same protection
against creditors in most other EU countries that they receive in Ireland,
subject to and in accordance with the Insolvency Regulation.</p>

<h3>Debt Relief Notice</h3>

<p>The Debt Relief Notice (DRN) process provides debt relief for people who
have virtually no disposable income or assets and no prospect of being able to
pay off the debt in the next 3 years. If a DRN is issued for you, it will allow
for the write-off of your qualifying debt up to €35,000 (formerly €20,000)
subject to a 3-year supervision period.</p>

<p>During this period your creditors will not be able to pursue you for
payment, but if your circumstances improve during the 3 years, you may have to
pay part of your debts accordingly. At the end of the 3 years, all of the debts
covered by the DRN will be written off, even if you have not managed to pay
anything off them.</p>

<p><strong>How do you get a DRN?</strong></p>

<p>Your application must be made through an Approved Intermediary (AI) – see
<a href="personal_insolvency_options.en.html#ld1a9a">How to apply</a> below.
This is a person or class of persons authorised by the ISI to support a debtor
to make an application for a Debt Relief Notice. </p>

<p>Read more in our document on <a href="debt_relief_notices.html">Debt
Relief Notices (DRNs)</a> and on the <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/DRN">ISI's website</a>.</p>

<h3>Debt Settlement Arrangement</h3>

<p>A Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA) provides for the agreed settlement of
unsecured debt with one or more creditors over a period of 5 years, with a
possible agreed extension to 6 years. You may apply for a DSA if the level of
your income, assets and debts would make you ineligible for a Debt Relief
Notice. You must be able to make some repayments to your creditors in return
for a discount of your debts. The DSA is a voluntary arrangement and it will
have to get the support of creditors representing at least 65% of your total
debt.</p>

<p>You must process your application through a Personal Insolvency Practitioner
(PIP). This is a professional who is approved and registered by the Insolvency
Service of Ireland to operate DSAs and Personal Insolvency Arrangements – see
<a href="personal_insolvency_options.en.html#ld1a9a">How to apply</a> below.</p>

<p>When the agreed period ends, and if your DSA has operated successfully, you
will be discharged from the debts that it covered.</p>

<p>Read more in our document on <a href="debt_settlement_arrangements.html">Debt Settlement Arrangements
(DSAs)</a> and on the <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/DSA">ISI's
website</a>.</p>

<h3>Personal Insolvency Arrangement</h3>

<p>A Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) provides for the agreed settlement
of secured debt up to a limit of €3 million (although this cap may be
increased with the consent of all secured creditors) and an unlimited amount of
unsecured debt. A PIA will run over a period of 6 years, with a possible agreed
extension to 7 years.</p>

<p>The PIA works like a Debt Settlement Arrangement in the following ways:</p>
<ul><li>You must apply through a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) – see
    <a href="personal_insolvency_options.en.html#ld1a9al">How to apply</a>
  below</li>
  <li>You must be able to make some repayments to your creditors in return for
    a discount of your debts</li>
  <li>It is a voluntary arrangement and must get the support of creditors –
    both secured and unsecured – representing at least 65% of your total
  debt</li>
</ul><p>In addition, over 50% of your secured creditors and 50% of unsecured
creditors must vote in favour.</p>

<p>However, the <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR15000598">Personal Insolvency
(Amendment) Act 2015</a> now provides for court review where a mortgage lender
rejects the borrower’s personal insolvency proposal. A new <a href="../../../../housing/owning_a_home/mortgage_arrears/aid_and_advice_scheme.html">aid
and advice scheme</a> for people in serious mortgage arrears allows for free
legal representation for eligible borrowers in seeking such a review. </p>

<p>When the agreed period ends, and if your PIA has operated successfully, you
will be discharged from the unsecured debts that it covered but the secured
debt will only be discharged to the extent specified in the PIA.</p>

Arrangements (PIAs)</a> and on the <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/PIA">ISI's website</a>.</p>

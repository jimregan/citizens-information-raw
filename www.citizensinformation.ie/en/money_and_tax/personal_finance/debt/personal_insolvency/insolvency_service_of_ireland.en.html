<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) was set up under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0044/index.html">Personal
Insolvency Act 2012</a>, which introduced <a href="personal_insolvency_options.html">3 new debt settlement procedures</a>
and reduced the term of bankruptcy from 12 years to 3 years (now 1 year). The
Act has been amended several times and the Law Reform Commission has prepared a
<a href="http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/en_act_2012_0044.PDF">consolidated
version (pdf)</a>. </p>

<p>The ISI is responsible for all matters concerning personal insolvency. </p>

<p>Its role includes:</p>
<ul><li>Administering the debt settlement procedures introduced by the Act</li>
  <li>Authorising Approved Intermediaries (AIs)</li>
  <li>Authorising and regulating Personal Insolvency Practitioners (PIPs)</li>
  <li>Developing guidelines</li>
  <li>Providing information</li>
  <li>Arranging for provision of education and training</li>
  <li>Monitoring the operation of the debt settlement procedures</li>
  <li>Contributing to policy development</li>
</ul><p>It has a website <a href="http://backontrack.ie/">backontrack.ie</a>, aimed
at people who are struggling with debt, as well as <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/">its main website isi.gov.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>Measures to support people in mortgage arrears</h3>

<p>A series of measures <a href="http://www.merrionstreet.ie/MerrionStreet/en/News-Room/Releases/Government_Strengthens_Framework_to_Support_Mortgage_Holders_in_Arrears.html">announced
on 13 May 2015</a> included changes to the personal insolvency system. <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR15000598">All of these changes are
now in effect.</a> They include court review where a mortgage lender rejects
the borrower’s personal insolvency proposal.</p>

<p>As part of <a href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/news/2016/news20161003.html">Abhaile,
the national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service</a>, a new <a href="../../../../housing/owning_a_home/mortgage_arrears/aid_and_advice_scheme.html">aid
and advice scheme</a> for people in serious mortgage arrears covers free legal
representation for eligible borrowers in seeking such a court review. </p>

<p>The ISI is centrally involved in this new scheme and maintains a <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Aid_and_Advice_PIP_Panel.pdf/Files/Aid_and_Advice_PIP_Panel.pdf">panel
of Personal Insolvency Practitioners (pdf)</a> to offer free advice and help
under it. Read <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/Mortgage_Arrears_Aid_and_Advice_Scheme">more
on the ISI's website</a>, including <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Aid_and_Advice_FAQs.pdf/Files/Aid_and_Advice_FAQs.pdf">FAQs
(pdf)</a> on the scheme.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l9fc9a">Debt settlement procedures </h2>

<p>The ISI has a central role in administering the <a href="http://isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/WP13000055">3 debt resolution
mechanisms</a> introduced by the Act - Debt Relief Notices (DRNs), Debt
Settlement Arrangements (DSAs) and Personal Insolvency Arrangements (PIAs), and
in monitoring their operation. It also plays a key role in administering <a href="what_is_bankruptcy.html">bankruptcy</a> procedures.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/Media_&amp;_Statistics">Statistics</a>
on the operation of all the above processes are published on the ISI’s
website. </p>

<h3>Debt Relief Notices (DRNs)</h3>

<p>The ISI is more directly involved with the implementation of DRNs than with
DSAs or PIAs.</p>

<p>When a debtor and their Approved Intermediary (AI) have both signed off on a
DRN application, it is transmitted to the ISI for checking and verification.
The ISI can then request further information from the AI and can also enquire
into the debtor’s bank accounts and into any other matter that it considers
relevant in verifying the application. It can request information about the
debtor’s financial circumstances from Government departments, the Revenue
Commissioners and other State bodies.</p>

<p>When the ISI is satisfied that the application is in order, it issues a
certificate to that effect and notifies the Circuit Court. If the court is also
satisfied, it issues a Debt Relief Notice and notifies the Insolvency Service.
The ISI then notifies the AI, the debtor and the relevant creditor(s).</p>

<p>When the DRN has been issued, the ISI publishes its details on the <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/Register_of_Debt_Relief_Notices">Register
of Debt Relief Notices</a>, which is accessible to the public. It then takes
responsibility for the administration of the DRN for a 3-year supervision
period. This can include handling any payments that the debtor is able to make;
investigating any matters it considers relevant to the DRN; applying to the
Circuit Court for variation or termination of the DRN; registering any
amendments; and registering termination of the DRN.</p>

<p>When the DRN is terminated, the ISI removes all the information about it
from the Register and issues a Debt Relief Certificate to the debtor,
confirming that they have been discharged from the relevant debts. It also
writes to all the creditors concerned, to tell them that the Debt Relief Notice
has been removed from the Register.</p>

<p>Read more in our document on <a href="debt_relief_notices.html">Debt
Relief Notices</a> and in <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/DRN">the
ISI’s information on DRNs</a>.</p>

<h3>Debt Settlement Arrangements (DSAs) and Personal Insolvency Arrangements
(PIAs)</h3>

<p>The ISI checks and verifies applications for protective certificates. (A
protective certificate is a preliminary to a DSA or a PIA. While it is in
force, it protects the debtor from the initiation or continuation of certain
enforcement proceedings or other actions.) When satisfied with the application,
the ISI transmits it to the Circuit Court. The Court reviews the application
and, if satisfied, issues a protective certificate.</p>

<p>When the Court issues a protective certificate, the ISI registers it and
notifies the debtor's Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) - the professional
who is approved and registered by the ISI to operate DSAs and PIAs. The PIP
notifies the debtor and creditors concerned. The PIP then works with the debtor
to prepare a proposal to creditors. If this proposal is accepted, the PIP
notifies the ISI. The ISI notifies the Court. If the Court approves the DSA or
PIA, the ISI then registers it.</p>

<p>After this, the PIP handles the day-to-day administration of the DSA or PIA.
The ISI’s role only involves registering any variations in the agreement, its
failure or its successful completion.</p>

(DSAs)</a> <a href="personal_insolvency_arrangements.html">Personal
Insolvency Arrangements (PIAs)</a> and in <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/DSA">the ISI’s information on
DSAs</a> and on <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/PIA">PIAs</a>.</p>

<h3>Bankruptcy</h3>

<p>As noted above, the ISI plays a key role in the administration of
bankruptcy. The procedure is outlined in the <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Bankruptcy_feb.pdf/Files/Bankruptcy_feb.pdf">Debtor's
Guide to Bankruptcy (pdf)</a> published by the ISI. </p>

<h3>Authorising Approved Intermediaries (AIs)</h3>

<p>An Approved Intermediary (AI) is a person or class of persons authorised by
the ISI to support a debtor to make an application for a Debt Relief Notice.
All Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS) have been authorised as AIs. –
see <a href="insolvency_service_of_ireland.en.html#lef21f">Where to apply</a>
below. </p>

<h3>Authorising and regulating Personal Insolvency Practitioners (PIPs)</h3>

<p>The Insolvency Service authorises and regulates Personal Insolvency
Practitioners (PIPs) who are responsible for helping people to apply for
protective certificates and prepare proposals for a DSA or PIA. PIPs are also
responsible for calling creditors’ meetings and for administering the
payments and other arrangements agreed to as part of the DSA or PIA.</p>

<p>The ISI’s role includes:</p>
<ul><li>Setting qualifying criteria for PIPs</li>
  <li>Reviewing and deciding on applications from people wishing to
  practise</li>
  <li>Issuing authorisations and registering PIPs</li>
  <li>Inspecting individual PIPs</li>
  <li>Investigating complaints</li>
  <li>Reviewing authorisations</li>
</ul><p>The ISI has made Regulations to govern various matters concerning PIPs and
has published the <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/PIPs">details of
the PIPs who have been authorised</a>. </p>

<h3>Developing guidelines</h3>

<p>A key criterion for getting a DRN is that the person has been left with no
more than €60 net disposable income per month after reasonable living
expenses.</p>

<p>The ISI has prepared detailed guidelines on what constitutes <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/RLE_calculated">reasonable living
expenses</a>, as required under the Personal Insolvency Act. The Act requires
the guidelines to be reviewed regularly.</p>

<p>When preparing the guidelines on reasonable living expenses, The Act
requires the ISI to consult widely and to have regard to:</p>
<ul><li>Measures and indicators of poverty set out in Government policy
    publications on poverty and social inclusion</li>
  <li>Official statistics and surveys published by the Central Statistics
    Office, relating to household income and expenditure</li>
  <li>The Consumer Price Index or similar indices</li>
  <li>Differences in the size and composition of households, and the differing
    needs of people, having regard to age, health and whether they have a
    physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual disability</li>
  <li>The need to facilitate the social inclusion of debtors and their
    dependants, and their active participation in economic activity</li>
  <li>Whatever other information the ISI considers appropriate</li>
</ul><h3>Developing protocols</h3>

<p>The ISI's Debt Solutions Protocol Steering Group has developed protocols for
use by PIPs when making straightforward proposals to creditors for either a DSA
or PIA. <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/Protocol_Team">These
protocols are on the ISI's website</a>, along with background information and
FAQs.</p>

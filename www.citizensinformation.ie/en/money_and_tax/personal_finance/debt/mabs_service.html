Service (MABS)</a> is a free and confidential service for people who are having
problems with money management and debt. MABS money advisers provide advice and
practical help to people to review their debts, deal with their creditors and
work out solutions.</p>

<h3>Enhancement of MABS role</h3>

<p>A series of <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/pressoffice/Pages/pr010915.aspx">measures to
support people in mortgage arrears</a> has enhanced the role of MABS, to
include a Dedicated Mortgage Arrears service and a court mentor service – see
below.</p>

<p>In addition, MABS is centrally involved in a new aid and advice scheme for
people in serious mortgage arrears, as part of <a href="../../../housing/owning_a_home/mortgage_arrears/aid_and_advice_scheme.html">Abhaile</a>,
the national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service. <a href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/news/2016/news20161003.html">This
service was launched in October 2016</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l536ed">Services provided by MABS</h2>

<p>MABS offers a range of services, as follows:</p>

<h3>Dealing with debt</h3>

<p>Your debts may become a problem for many reasons, such as job loss, illness,
extra expenses, or loans that you can’t pay. A MABS money adviser can:</p>
<ul><li>Help you deal with your debts and make out a budget</li>
  <li>Review your income to make sure that you are not missing any
  entitlements</li>
  <li>Contact your creditors for you, with offers of payment that you can
  afford</li>
  <li>Help you decide on the best way to make the payments</li>
</ul><p>MABS has agreed a <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/downloads/news_press/BPFI_MABS_protocol_2014.pdf">protocol
(pdf)</a> with a the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI) to help
people to manage their debt repayments in an affordable way. The lenders
involved have committed to work with MABS to help customers to address their
debt problems and agree a sustainable repayment plan. The protocol allows for
write-off of some debt, at the lender’s discretion. It does not apply to
mortgage debt.</p>

<p>MABS can also help you to agree a sustainable repayment plan with other
creditors (who are not part of the protocol).</p>

<h3>If you cannot pay your debts</h3>

<p>Most MABS services are registered as Approved Intermediaries with the <a href="personal_insolvency/insolvency_service_of_ireland.html">Insolvency
Service of Ireland (ISI)</a> and can assess whether a <a href="personal_insolvency/debt_relief_notices.html">Debt Relief Notice</a>
is an appropriate solution for you and bring you through the application
process. MABS can also advise you on how to access other <a href="personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_options.html">personal
insolvency options</a>.</p>

<h3>Addressing mortgage arrears</h3>

<p>If you are having <a href="../../../housing/owning_a_home/mortgage_arrears/overview_of_mortgage_debt.html">difficulty
paying your mortgage</a>, MABS can advise you on your options. The Central
Bank’s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears requires mortgage lenders to
operate a <a href="../../../housing/owning_a_home/mortgage_arrears/mortgage_arrears_resolution_process.html">Mortgage
Arrears Resolution Process (MARP)</a> for people in mortgage difficulty. The
lender must refer you to sources of information and advice, such as MABS and <a href="http://www.keepingyourhome.ie/">keepingyourhome.ie</a>. MABS publishes a
<a href="https://www.mabs.ie/self-help-guide/dealing-with-mortgage-debt/">series
of guides and leaflets on dealing with mortgage debt</a>.</p>

<p>As part of the MARP, you must assemble all of your financial details and
fill out a <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/consumer/info/documents/industry%20standard%20financial%20statement.pdf">standard
financial statement (SFS) (pdf)</a> for your lender, so that they can assess
your financial position and work out the best solution. MABS can help you to
complete this statement. It has worked with the Central Bank to develop a <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/consumer/info/Documents/Guide%20to%20Completing%20a%20Standard%20Financial%20Statement.pdf">consumer
guide (pdf)</a> to completing an SFS.</p>

<h3>Dedicated Mortgage Arrears (DMA) service</h3>

<p>In addition to the standard services that MABS provides, over 20 MABS
offices now have specialist mortgage arrears advisers, who can help mortgage
holders to assess an offer made by their mortgage lender and can negotiate with
the lender if required. </p>

<h3>Court mentor service</h3>

<p>For homeowners who are facing court proceedings to <a href="../../../housing/losing_your_home/home_repossession.html">repossess
their homes</a>, a national network of court mentors is now in place. This
service offers support and advice on court proceedings, as well as direct
referral back to MABS where a case is adjourned. MABS works in close
collaboration with the <a href="personal_insolvency/insolvency_service_of_ireland.html">Insolvency
Service of Ireland (ISI)</a> to deliver the court mentor service.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/news/2015/news20151222.html">Read
more about these 2 services</a>.</p>

<h3>Scheme of aid and advice</h3>

<p>MABS is also centrally involved in a new aid and advice scheme for people in
serious mortgage arrears, as part of <a href="../../../housing/owning_a_home/mortgage_arrears/aid_and_advice_scheme.html">Abhaile</a>,
the national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service. <a href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/news/2016/news20161003.html">This
service was launched in October 2016</a>.</p>

<h3>Other services</h3>

<p>MABS also provides <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/en/how_we_help/education/">money management
education</a> and produces a range of <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/publications/">publications</a>. These and other
useful resources, including a <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/en/how_we_help/debt_and_budgeting_tools/mabs_self_help.html">self-help

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lbdf28">What you can do yourself</h2>

<p>The most important step you can take is to <strong>contact your creditors
immediately</strong> to let them know that you are having difficulties. Then
you will be able to work with them to deal with the situation. Otherwise the
problems and the pressure from creditors will just get worse.</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/en/how_we_help/debt_and_budgeting_tools/mabs_self_help.html">MABS
self-help tool</a> to work through the following steps:</p>

<p>1. <strong>Assess your situation.</strong> Make a list of all your debts.
Check that each debt is in your name. Identify the debts needing immediate
attention (for example, mortgage arrears). Get in touch with the lenders
immediately - preferably in writing – to tell them that you are assessing
your situation and ask them to put a temporary hold on your repayments. There
is a <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/downloads/self_help/Contact_Creditors_letter.doc">sample
letter</a> on the MABS website.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Make out a budget.</strong> List how much money is coming into
your household each week (or month) and how much is going out. You can get
useful documents like a blank budget sheet and <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/downloads/self_help/Final_MABS_Weekly_Spending_Booklet_v8_27.1.12.pdf">spending
diary (pdf)</a> from the MABS website or ask for them through the MABS
helpline.</p>

<p>3. <strong>Deal with the debt.</strong> Write to the lender, making an offer
of the amount you can afford to pay and explaining your financial situation.
The MABS website has a <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/downloads/self_help/letter_of_offer_text.doc">sample
letter of offer</a> and blank financial statements.</p>

<p>4. <strong>Organise a method of paying the agreed amount.</strong> You can
do this in various ways, such as direct debit or through internet banking.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l3c613">How MABS can help you</h2>

<p>MABS provides a confidential service and will not discuss your situation
with anyone without your signed agreement. MABS will give you information and
support you in making decisions, but will not tell you what to do about your
debts and payments. You are the person who decides.</p>

<p>If you contact the MABS Helpline - see ' Where to apply' below - an adviser
will talk you through your money concerns and give you some advice. They can
send you some information and materials to help you to address your money
problems. You may be able to deal with the issues yourself at this stage, or
you may need to see a money adviser face-to-face in a MABS office. The
face-to-face service is by appointment only.</p>

<p>When you contact MABS, it is important to tell them about anything very
urgent, for example, if you are being taken to court or your electricity is to
be disconnected. In cases like these, you may be able to get an emergency
appointment.</p>

<p>To be able to help you, the MABS adviser will need as much information as
possible about your financial situation. You will need to collect any bills,
statements, account books, payslips, or social welfare receipts that you have,
as well as any letters that your creditors have sent, even if you haven’t
opened them.</p>

<p>The adviser will:</p>
<ul><li>Look at all your income and ensure that you are getting all your
    entitlements</li>
  <li>Check through all your debts and ensure that you are the person who is
    liable for them</li>
  <li>Help you to work out how much you need to cover your everyday needs</li>
  <li>Give you advice on budgeting</li>
  <li>Draw up a financial statement for use when dealing with your
  creditors</li>
  <li>Help you to decide which of your debts have the highest priority</li>
  <li>Help you to work out a payment plan – how much you can afford to pay
    each week off each debt</li>
  <li>Negotiate with your creditors on your behalf, if you wish</li>
  <li>Provide support while you deal with your debts</li>
  <li>Refer you to other services and contact them on your behalf, if you
  wish</li>
  <li>Help to arrange to pay regular amount off your debts, as agreed with your
    creditors</li>
  <li>Refer you to someone who can help with a <a href="personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_options.html">personal
    insolvency option</a> if appropriate</li>
</ul></div>

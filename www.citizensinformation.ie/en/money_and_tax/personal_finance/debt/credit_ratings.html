<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Banks and other lenders generally send information about borrowers to a
central database that is operated by a credit reference agency or credit
register. This information includes what credit agreements you have made and
your history of repaying them. It is used to generate a <em>credit rating</em>
or <em>credit score</em>, which indicates whether your credit repayment record
is good or poor.</p>

<p>The database is available for lenders to consult to see if potential
borrowers have ever defaulted on loans. The aim of the system is to help
lenders to assess the ability of borrowers to repay any future debts.</p>

<h3>Credit Reporting Act 2013 </h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/act/pub/0045/index.html">Credit
Reporting Act 2013</a> came into effect on 27 January 2014. It provides for the
establishment and operation of a statutory Central Credit Register (CCR)
system. Credit providers will be required to report a comprehensive range of
credit information. They will be obliged to check with the Register for all
applications for credit above €2,000 in value. Consumers will be entitled to
get one free copy of their record every 12 months. Read more about the Act in
<a href="http://www.finance.gov.ie/news-centre/press-releases/credit-reporting-act-2013">this
press release</a>. </p>

<p>The Central Credit Register will be established and operated by the Central
Bank of Ireland, which <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/press-area/press-releases/Pages/CentralCreditRegisterRegulationsPublished.aspx">has
published regulations</a> governing its operation. It is expected to start
producing credit reports after December 2017. </p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l401a3">Credit reference agencies</h2>

<p>Credit reference agencies collect both negative information and positive
information about consumers. <em>Negative information</em> is information about
any default on credit repayments, such as arrears, missed payments and
bankruptcies. <em>Positive information</em> is information relating to your
overall financial standing, such as your overdraft limit, the limit on your
credit card and records of your repayments.</p>

<p>The main credit reference agency for individuals in Ireland is the <a href="../loans_and_credit/irish_credit_bureau.html">Irish Credit Bureau
(ICB)</a> but there are several other agencies, mainly dealing with businesses.
</p>

<p>The ICB compiles a private database of information supplied by its <a href="http://www.icb.ie/membership.php">members</a>, which are the main
financial institutions, including some credit unions. Local authorities are
also members. Membership does not include utility companies or retail outlets.
The database includes information on a wide range of loans, including personal
loans, mortgages and credit card loans. That information is available only to
members of the ICB (and, of course, to yourself).</p>

<p>The ICB does not decide whether or not you get a loan. Financial
institutions use the information held by the ICB when deciding whether or not
to lend to you.</p>

<p>International credit rating agencies (for example, Moody’s, Fitch’s,
Standard and Poor’s) generally assess business debts and have little
relevance to consumers.</p>

<h3>Information about you</h3>

<p>The Irish Credit Bureau’s database will only hold information about you if
you have had an active loan in the past 5 years and if your lender has provided
information to the ICB. The information is held in an individual credit report.
It includes:</p>
<ul><li>Your name, date of birth, address(es) used by you in relation to
    financial transactions</li>
  <li>Names of lenders and account numbers of loans that you currently hold, or
    that were active within the last 5 years</li>
  <li>Repayments made or missed for each month on each loan</li>
  <li>Failure to clear off any loan</li>
  <li>Loans that were settled for less than you owed and</li>
  <li>Legal actions that your lender took against you.</li>
</ul><p>The system records when a lender has consulted it, so you can find out if
this happened in your case. Every financial institution that is a member of the
ICB is required to provide you with details of any credit reference agency it
has used when assessing your application for a loan.</p>

<p>Credit agencies may publish lists of judgments registered in the Central
Office of the High Court (for example, such lists are published in <em>Stubbs
Gazette</em> and some newspapers). This is public information. You have no
control over its publication or the use that is made of it.</p>

<h3>Summary of your credit status</h3>

<p>Credit scoring is a technique which summarises your credit status at a
particular point in time. The ICB will calculate a Credit Bureau Score (CBS)
based on your credit report if a lender requests it (only if the lender is an
ICB member).</p>

<p>If you have a good record of repaying loans, then you get a high score. You
get a low score if your repayment record is poor. The only way to improve your
credit score is to improve your repayment record.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l27945">Legal matters </h2>

<h3>Consent</h3>

<p>Your consent is required for the provision of information about your credit
history to the Irish Credit Bureau. However, it is sometimes the practice that
such consent is an integral part of your credit agreement, so you may not
notice that you have given consent.</p>

<p>You have the usual rights under <a href="http://www.dataprotection.ie/documents/legal/CompendiumAct.pdf">data
protection legislation (pdf)</a> to access the records held about you by credit
agencies and to have incorrect information rectified. You may ask the agency to
provide you with a copy of the personal information it holds about you. If this
is inaccurate, you may ask the agency to correct it. If you are not satisfied
with how the agency deals with you, you may appeal to the <a href="../../../government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/data_protection.html">Data
Protection Commissioner</a>.</p>

<h3>Requirement to consult information on databases</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/si/0281.html">European
Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010 (SI 281/2010)</a>
provide that creditors, before agreeing to give you a loan, are obliged to
assess your creditworthiness based on sufficient information obtained from you
and, where necessary, from a database of such information. They also provide
that, if you are refused credit because of the information found on the
database, the creditor must immediately tell you this and give you particulars
of the database used. This legislation applies to personal consumer credit
agreements for amounts between €200 and €75,000 and it does not apply to
mortgages. </p>

<h3>Regulation of credit agencies</h3>

<p>At present, there is no regulation of such agencies. There is <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/securities/docs/agencies/proposal_en.pdf">an
EU proposal to regulate credit rating agencies</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l78750">Getting a copy of your credit
record</h2>

<p>You can get a copy of your credit record by <a href="https://secure.icb.ie/cr_personal.jsp?js=true">applying online</a> to the
Irish Credit Bureau and paying €6. For security reasons, it will be posted
out to you. It will not be emailed.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can download a <a href="http://www.icb.ie/pdf/Personal%20Application.pdf">Personal Enquiry Form
(pdf)</a> or <a href="http://www.icb.ie/contact_us.php">request an application
form</a>. Send the completed application form with payment of €6 to the
address below.</p>

<p>Only 1 search can be conducted per application, and the ICB takes about 3 or
4 days to process each one.</p>

<p>The report that the ICB issues will display a unique reference number. You
may then contact the ICB to discuss your report, quoting this unique number.
You cannot discuss your credit record with the ICB by phone until you have
received the report.</p>

<p>If you wish to have inaccurate information on your credit record amended,
contact the lender concerned and ask them to forward the correct information to
the ICB. The ICB cannot change the information unless asked to do so by the
relevant lender.</p>

<p>The ICB has published <a href="http://www.icb.ie/credit_rating.php">further
information about credit ratings</a>.</p>

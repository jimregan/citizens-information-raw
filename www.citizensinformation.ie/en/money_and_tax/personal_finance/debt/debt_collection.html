<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you owe money to someone, they are your creditor and you are their
debtor. They are entitled to ask you to pay your debts but they are not
entitled to harass or intimidate you.</p>

<p>There are specific rules for debt collection in relation to agreements
covered by the consumer credit legislation - namely the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Consumer
Credit Act 1995</a> and the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2010/si/281/made/en/print">European
Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010</a>.</p>

<p>In general, financial services providers must comply with the Central Bank's
<a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/consumer/cpc/Pages/home1.aspx">Consumer
Protection Code 2012</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lc0b34">Private debt collectors</h2>

<p>Instead of directly pursuing you for the debt, creditors sometimes sell the
debt to a private collection agency. Such agencies are not subject to
authorisation and supervision in their own right by the Central Bank.</p>

<p>However, if a financial services provider that is regulated by the Central
Bank outsources its debt collection activities, any agent acting on its behalf
must comply with the requirements of Irish financial services law. If it fails
to do so, the Central Bank may impose penalties on the financial services
provider.</p>

<p>If a regulated financial services provider plans to appoint a third party to
engage with you about arrears that you owe, it must inform you of this in
writing and explain the role of the third party.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l0909d">Contact between lenders and consumers</h2>

<p>Under the Consumer Protection Code 2012, a financial services provider that
is regulated by the Central Bank cannot phone you in connection with your loan
without your consent between 9 pm and 9 am, Monday to Saturday, or at any time
on a Sunday or public holiday. They can only visit you in person if you have
given your informed consent to the visit.</p>

<p>The lender is not permitted to call you or to visit you at your place of
work unless you are also living there, or unless all reasonable efforts to
contact you elsewhere have failed. Only the person involved in the loan can be
contacted about it. This means that your lender cannot contact your employer or
a member of your family about your loan.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l35a29">Legal proceedings</h2>

<p>If you do not engage with your creditor, they can initiate <a href="court_procedures.html">legal proceedings</a> to recover the debt.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="l724df">Harassment and intimidation</h2>

<p>All debt collectors, including private individuals and debt collection
agencies, are covered by <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0026/sec0011.html#zza26y1997s11">Section
11 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997</a>. This provides
that a person is guilty of an offence if he/she makes any demand for payment of
a debt and if:</p>
<ul><li>The demands are so frequent as to be calculated to subject you or a
    member of your family to alarm, distress or humiliation, or</li>
  <li>The person falsely represents that criminal proceedings lie for
    non-payment of the debt, or</li>
  <li>The person falsely represents that he or she is authorised in some
    official capacity to enforce payment, or</li>
  <li>The person utters a document falsely represented to have an official
    character</li>
</ul><p>If you are subjected to such behaviour by your creditor or by a debt
collection agency, you should report the matter to the <a href="http://www.garda.ie">Garda Síochána</a>. Anyone found guilty of
offences under the Act is subject to large fines and up to 14 years in
prison.</p>

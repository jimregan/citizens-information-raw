<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This glossary contains some of the main terms used in connection with
problem debt and personal insolvency. The following organisations also publish
collections of terms related to debt:</p>
<ul><li>Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) - <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/Glossary">glossary</a></li>
  <li>Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) – <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/jargon-buster/?tx_a21glossaryadvancedoutput_pi1%5Bchar%5D=d&amp;cHash=6b165d7745158de46b9c0d1bd13b0b03">jargon

  <li>Competition and Consumer Protection Commission - <a href="http://www.consumerhelp.ie/index.jsp?a=595&amp;n=149&amp;p=105">jargon
    buster</a></li>
</ul><h3>Approved Intermediary</h3>

<p>This is a person or class of persons authorised by the <a href="personal_insolvency/insolvency_service_of_ireland.html">Insolvency
Service of Ireland (ISI)</a> to support a debtor to make an application for a
<a href="personal_insolvency/debt_relief_notices.html">Debt Relief Notice
(DRN)</a>.</p>

<h3>Bankruptcy</h3>

<p>Bankruptcy is a settlement of the debts of someone who is wholly or
partially unable to repay their debts. It deals with both
<strong>secured</strong> and unsecured debt.</p>

<p>The purpose of the bankruptcy is to distribute your assets fairly among your
creditors and protect you from these creditors. The distribution is done
through a court official, the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy. <a href="personal_insolvency/what_is_bankruptcy.html">Read more in our document
on bankruptcy</a>.</p>

<h3>Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA)</h3>

<p>The CCMA is a statutory code, issued by the Central Bank of Ireland, which
requires mortgage lenders to adopt specific procedures when dealing with
borrowers who are facing mortgage arrears. Under this Code, each lender must
have a <strong>Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP)</strong>. <a href="../../../housing/owning_a_home/mortgage_arrears/consumer_protection_codes_and_mortgages.html">Read
more in our document on Consumer protection codes and mortgages</a>.</p>

<h3>Consumer credit agreements</h3>

<p>The rules on consumer credit agreements apply to almost all credit
agreements, hire-purchase agreements and consumer-hire agreements to which a
consumer is a party. So, they apply to agreements to borrow money which you
make with banks, building societies, moneylenders and certain other finance
companies. They do not apply to agreements to borrow money from credit unions,
pawnbrokers and utility service providers nor do they apply to agreements
entered into by businesses.</p>

<p>Agreements covered by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">consumer
credit legislation</a> must be in writing. If they are not in writing, they are
not <a href="enforcement_of_judgments.html">enforceable</a>. The legislation
provides that it is an offence for a creditor to demand payment if the
agreement is not enforceable.</p>

<p>The Central Bank’s <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/processes/consumer-protection-code/Documents/Consumer%20Protection%20Code%202012.pdf">Consumer
Protection Code</a> applies to most consumer credit agreements. The <a href="http://www.financialregulator.ie/press-area/press-releases/pages/consumerprotectioncodeforlicensedmoneylenders.aspx">Consumer
Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders</a> applies to moneylenders.</p>

<h3>Contracts</h3>

<p>In a debt context, a contract is an agreement by one party to provide goods
or services for another in return for payment. In general, contracts do not
have to be in writing in order to be enforceable. However, contracts for the
sale of land and contracts governed by the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0024/index.html">Consumer
Credit Act 1995</a> must be in writing in order to be enforceable.</p>

<p>Failure to pay is a breach of the contract. Contracts may include penalty
clauses for failure to meet the terms of the contract. So, for example, the
contract may provide that you must pay an extra charge or you must pay interest
if you fail to pay on time. </p>

<h3>Court judgment</h3>

<p>In this context, a Court judgment states that you owe a debt. That judgment
can then be <a href="enforcement_of_judgments.html">enforced in various
ways</a>.</p>

<h3>Credit rating</h3>

<p>Your credit rating or <em>credit score</em> is based on whether your credit
repayment record is good or poor. It is used to help lenders to assess the
ability of borrowers to repay any future debts.</p>

<p>Banks and other lenders generally send information about borrowers to a
central database that is operated by a credit reference agency or credit
register. This information includes what credit agreements you have made and
your history of repaying them. Your credit rating is based on this information.
<a href="credit_ratings.html">Read more in our document on credit
ratings</a>.</p>

<h3>Creditor</h3>

<p>The creditor is the person (or company) to whom you owe money. This person
is known as the <em>judgment creditor</em> if judgment is awarded against you
in court. </p>

<h3>Debt forbearance and forgiveness</h3>

<p><em>Debt forbearance</em> is the term that is sometimes used by creditors
when they agree to allow you to change the manner in which your debt will be
repaid, for example, by postponing some payments or by restructuring the manner
in which repayments are made. You continue to owe all the money and you will
eventually have to repay it all. </p>

<p><em>Debt forgiveness</em> or cancellation occurs when your creditor decides
not to pursue the debt. Permanent debt forgiveness is rare. Some creditors may
cease to pursue the debt because they recognise that you will never be able to
repay it but that does not mean that the debt is forgiven or cancelled. If your
circumstances change, you may still be pursued for it. </p>

<h3>Debt management agencies</h3>

<p>A debt management firm is one that charges for the provision of debt
management services. The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/act/pub/0026/index.html">Central
Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013</a> defines debt management
services as:</p>
<ul><li>Giving advice about the discharge of debts (in whole or in part),
    including advice about budgeting in connection with the discharge of
  debts</li>
  <li>Negotiating with a person’s creditors for the discharge of the
    person’s debts (in whole or in part), or</li>
  <li>Any similar activity associated with the discharge of debts</li>
</ul><p>There are a number of private commercial debt management firms, which are
regulated by the Central Bank. The Bank has published its <a href="https://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/industry-sectors/debt-management-firm/Documents/101013%20Authorisation%20Requirements%20and%20Standards%20for%20Debt%20Management%20Firms.pdf">Authorisation
Requirements and Standards for Debt Management Firms (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="mabs_service.html">Money Advice and Budgeting Service
(MABS)</a> is a non-commercial body providing debt management services and it
does not charge fees.</p>

<h3>Debt Relief Notice (DRN)</h3>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0044/index.html">Personal
Insolvency Act 2012</a>, the Debt Relief Notice is designed for people who have
very low disposable income or assets. It allows for the write-off of qualifying
debt up to €20,000, subject to a 3-year supervision period. Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/32/enacted/en/html">Personal
Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015,</a> the limit has increased to €35,000 with
effect from 29 September 2015. <a href="personal_insolvency/debt_relief_notices.html">Read more in our
document on Debt Relief Notices</a>.</p>

<h3>Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA)</h3>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0044/index.html">Personal
Insolvency Act 2012</a>, the Debt Settlement Arrangement applies to the agreed
settlement of <em>unsecured</em> debts, usually over a period of 5 years. (See
<strong>Secured loan</strong> below for definition.) The limit of 5 years can
increase to 6 years in some situations. When the DSA concludes successfully,
the debts that it covers will be fully discharged and the debtor will be
solvent again. <a href="personal_insolvency/debt_settlement_arrangements.html">Read more in
our document on Debt Settlement Arrangements</a>.</p>

<h3>Debtor</h3>

<p>You are a debtor if you owe money to someone. If a court judgment is awarded
against you, you are now a <em>judgment debtor</em>.</p>

<h3>Debts and criminal offences</h3>

<p>Most debts arise because you have failed to meet the terms of a contract.
For example, you borrow money from the bank or credit union and you fail to pay
it back, or you enter into an agreement to buy equipment by instalments and you
fail to pay. It is a breach of contract to fail to pay such debts - it is not
generally a criminal offence.</p>

<p>However, it is a criminal offence to fail to pay certain debts. For example,
it is an offence not to pay your taxes or your TV licence fee. You may be
charged and convicted for failure to pay such debts. Even if you are charged,
convicted and fined, you still owe the debt and can be sued for it in the
normal way. </p>

<h3>Excluded and excludable debts</h3>

<p>The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 specifies certain types of debt that
<strong>cannot</strong> be written off by a <strong>Debt Relief
Notice</strong>, a <strong>Debt Settlement Arrangement</strong> or a
<strong>Personal Insolvency Arrangement</strong>. These are called
<em>excluded</em> debts and are:</p>
<ul><li>Debts under family law orders, such as maintenance orders for spouses and
    children</li>
  <li>Debts due under court awards for personal injury or death</li>
  <li>Debts arising from a loan (or forbearance of a loan) obtained through
    fraud or similar wrongdoing</li>
  <li>Debts arising under court orders made under the Proceeds of Crime Acts or
    fines imposed by the courts for criminal offences</li>
</ul><p>The types of debt that <strong>may</strong> be written off are called
<em>excludable</em> debts and are:</p>
<ul><li>Taxes, duties or levies owed to the State, such as income tax, the Local
    Property Tax, VAT, capital taxes</li>
  <li>Service charges owed to local authorities</li>
  <li>Household Charge</li>
  <li>Rates</li>
  <li>Money owed under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (in respect of a loan
    advanced by the HSE to a nursing home resident to cover the amount due from
    the principal private residence)</li>
  <li>Money owed to the Department of Social Protection</li>
  <li>Debts due to owners’ management companies in respect of annual service
    charges or contributions due for multi-unit developments (this is the only
    non-State debt in this category)</li>
</ul><h3>Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP)</h3>

<p>Under the Central Bank's <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/publicinformation/Documents/2013%20CCMA.pdf">Code
of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) (pdf)</a> mortgage lenders must operate a
Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) when dealing with borrowers in
mortgage arrears or in pre-arrears. The 4 steps of the MARP are: communication;
financial information; assessment; and resolution. <a href="../../../housing/owning_a_home/mortgage_arrears/mortgage_arrears_resolution_process.html">Read
more in our document on the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process</a>.</p>

<h3>Personal insolvency</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0044/index.html">Personal
Insolvency Act 2012</a> states that:</p>
<ul><li>“insolvent”, in relation to a debtor, shall be construed as meaning
    that the debtor is unable to pay his or her debts in full as they fall
  due</li>
</ul><p>The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 introduced 3 debt resolution mechanisms for
people who cannot afford to pay their personal debts. These arrangements offer
different solutions to people in different situations. <a href="personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_options.html">Read more in our
document on these personal insolvency options</a>.</p>

<h3>Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA)</h3>

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0044/index.html">Personal
Insolvency Act 2012</a>, the Personal Insolvency Arrangement applies to the
agreed settlement and/or restructuring of secured debts up to a total of €3
million (as well as unsecured debts) over a period of 6 years. The cap of €3
million can be increased by agreement with your secured creditors and the limit
of 6 years can increase to 7 years in some situations. <a href="personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_arrangements.html">Read more
in our document on Personal Insolvency Arrangements</a> .</p>

<h3>Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP)</h3>

<p>A Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) is a professional who is authorised
by the <a href="personal_insolvency/insolvency_service_of_ireland.html">Insolvency
Service of Ireland (ISI)</a> and will act on your behalf throughout a
<strong>Debt Settlement Arrangement</strong> or a <strong>Personal Insolvency
Arrangement</strong>.</p>

<h3>Prescribed Financial Statement</h3>

<p>A <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/Prescribed_Financial_Statement">Prescribed
Financial Statement (PFS)</a> is a written statement of a debtor’s financial
affairs. Every applicant must complete a PFS with the help of an
<strong>Approved Intermediary</strong> (for a <strong>Debt Relief
Notice</strong>) or a <strong>Personal Insolvency Practitioner</strong> (for a
<strong>Debt Settlement Arrangement</strong> or a <strong>Personal Insolvency
Arrangement</strong>).</p>

<p>The PFS is used to establish the applicant’s eligibility for a debt
resolution mechanism; to form the basis for calculating a sustainable
contribution to be paid to the applicant’s creditors over the period of a DSA
or PIA and to identify the liabilities from which the applicant will be
discharged at the end of an arrangement.</p>

<h3>Priority debt </h3>

<p>The term <em>priority debt</em> can be used in a general sense but it can
also have a specific legal meaning. If you owe money to a number of creditors,
you have your own view of which of these debts take priority. Most people would
regard the repayments on their home as taking priority over the repayment of
other loans. </p>

<p>The legal meaning of <em>priority debt</em> may be different. For example,
in receiverships, liquidations and <strong>bankruptcy</strong>, the law sets
out the order in which the debts must be paid. </p>

<h3>Protective certificate</h3>

<p>This is a certificate issued by a court to protect the debtor against legal
proceedings by a creditor in respect of debts while a <strong>Personal
Insolvency Arrangement (PIA)</strong> or a <strong>Debt Settlement Arrangement
(DSA)</strong> is being put in place.</p>

<p>The protective certificate gives you 70 days during which your creditors may
not:</p>
<ul><li>Start or continue legal proceedings in respect of the debt</li>
  <li>Take or continue any steps to enforce a judgment or contact you about the
    debt unless you agree to this</li>
  <li>Start or continue bankruptcy proceedings against you</li>
</ul><h3>Reasonable living expenses</h3>

<p>Reasonable living expenses are the expenses that an insolvent debtor will
necessarily incur in achieving a ‘reasonable standard of living’ while
engaging in one of the arrangements introduced by the Personal Insolvency Act
2012. This minimum standard of living allows for expenses such as food,
clothing, health, education, transport, childcare and insurance.</p>

<p>The ISI has prepared detailed guidelines on what constitutes <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/en/ISI/Pages/RLE_calculated">reasonable living
expenses</a>. These guidelines are regularly updated, as required under the
Act. There is also an <a href="http://backontrack.ie/rle-calculator/">online
calculator</a>.</p>

<h3>Secured loan</h3>

<p>This is a loan on which property or goods are available as security against
non-payment. Mortgages are the most common secured loans. Sometimes, business
loans and other loans are also secured against property. </p>

<p>In general, debts such as bank loans and credit card debt are
<em>unsecured</em>. However, if you decide to roll up such loans into your
mortgage, they now become secured loans. </p>

<p>If the property or goods on which the security is based are subsequently
sold, the secured loan must be paid off before the proceeds can be used for any
other purposes. </p>

<h3>Simple contract debt</h3>

<p>This is a debt which arises because you have not paid for goods or services
which are not covered by any special rules. For example, if you buy goods using
a cheque and the cheque is not honoured, there is a simple contract debt to the
seller. If you use the services of a plumber and do not pay him, there is a
simple contract debt to the plumber. The seller or the plumber can go to court
to get judgment against you and then enforce that judgment. </p>

<p>A range of legislation provides that various fees and levies which have not
been paid may be dealt with in court in the same way as simple contract
debts.</p>

<h3>Sheriff</h3>

<p>Sheriffs are self-employed people who <a href="enforcement_of_judgments.html">enforce debt judgments</a> in counties
Cork and Dublin. County Registrars enforce debt judgments in all other places.
Sheriffs are paid for their enforcement work on a commission basis.</p>

<p>As well as County Sheriffs in Cork and Dublin, Revenue Sheriffs enforce
debts owed to the Revenue Commissioners. They have the power to collect tax
debts. They can do this on the basis of a certificate of liability issued by
the Collector General and do not need a court order. Revenue debts can also be
collected in the normal way if there is a court order.</p>

<h3>Standard Financial Statement</h3>

<p>A Standard Financial Statement (SFS) is a written statement of financial
affairs on an <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/consumer/info/documents/industry%20standard%20financial%20statement.pdf">industry
standard format (pdf)</a>, which a borrower in mortgage difficulty must
complete as part of the <strong>Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process
(MARP)</strong>. The lender must give the borrower an SFS form and must ensure
that the borrower understands the MARP process. It must offer help with
completing the SFS and mention sources of independent advice, such as <a href="mabs_service.html">MABS</a>.</p>

<p>It then uses the financial information on the form to assess the
borrower’s financial position and identify the best course of action. The
Central Bank has a <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/consumer/info/Documents/Guide%20to%20Completing%20a%20Standard%20Financial%20Statement.pdf">consumer
guide (pdf)</a> to completing an SFS. MABS has also published a <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/Information_Leaflets_and_Factsheets/Booklet_4_MABS_Guide_to_the_Code_of_Conduct_on_Mortgage_Arrears_2013_-_A_guide_to_the_standard_financial_statement.pdf">detailed
guide to the SFS (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Time limits/Statute of Limitations</h3>

<p>There are time limits (limitation periods) for taking most types of court
action. These time limits are set either in the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1957/act/6/enacted/en/html">Statute of
Limitations 1957</a>, as amended, or in specific legislation dealing with the
court issue involved. </p>

<p>The law in relation to time limits is complex but, in general, the time
limit for taking actions for breach of contract (for example, failure to pay
for goods or services provided), for debt judgments and for non-payment of
charges such as rent is 6 years. This means that if your creditor does not
start the court action within 6 years of the debt being due, the action is
<em>statute-barred</em>. Effectively, that means that you cannot be forced to
pay the debt. </p>

<p>If your creditor gets a judgment, then, in general, they have 12 years in
which to <a href="enforcement_of_judgments.html">enforce that
judgment</a>.</p>

<p>The general rules do not apply to taxes. There is a 4-year time limit on the
Revenue Commissioners seeking tax from you and there is a 4-year time limit on
you seeking repayment of taxes that you were not due to pay. However, if there
is any fraud or neglect, there is no time limit.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Any form of credit is a debt, so most people have some debts. It is only
when you are unable to keep up with the payments that your debt becomes a
problem. If you are in this situation, for whatever reason, you may find
yourself having some of the following difficulties: </p>
<ul><li>Missed payments and letters from creditors</li>
  <li>Borrowing money to pay bills and catch up with arrears</li>
  <li>Paying whichever creditor is putting on most pressure</li>
  <li>Making promises to pay unreasonable amounts</li>
  <li>Broken promises and more pressure from creditors </li>
  <li>Legal action</li>
</ul><p>It is vital to take action to deal with your debts and stop the situation
from getting any worse. For example, if you don’t start getting your debts
under control, your creditors could go to court and eventually <a href="../../../housing/losing_your_home/home_repossession.html">repossess
your home</a>. This can happen even if you have no mortgage on your home or
your mortgage payments are up to date. </p>

<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l40c7f">Getting help from MABS</h2>

<p>The <a href="mabs_service.html">Money Advice and Budgeting Service
(MABS)</a> is a free and confidential service for people with debt problems and
money management problems. MABS can help you to explore your options and deal
with your debt in a systematic way. <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/en/">Its
website mabs.ie</a> has several useful resources, including a self-help guide
– see ‘What you can do yourself’ below.</p>

<p><strong>Dealing with creditors:</strong> MABS has agreed a <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/downloads/news_press/BPFI_MABS_protocol_2014.pdf">protocol
(pdf)</a> with the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI) to help
people to manage their debt repayments in a way that they can afford. The
lenders that have signed up to the protocol have committed to work with MABS
money advisers to help customers to address their debt problems and agree a
sustainable plan of repayments. The protocol allows for write-off of some debt,
at the lender’s discretion. It does not apply to mortgage debt.</p>

<p>You can read more about this protocol in <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/downloads/news_press/BPFI_MABS_protocol_public_facing_FAQ.pdf">these
FAQs (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>Separately from this protocol, MABS can also help you to agree a sustainable
repayment plan with your other creditors.</p>

<p><strong>Accessing personal insolvency options:</strong> All MABS services
are registered as Approved Intermediaries with the Insolvency Service of
Ireland (ISI) and can bring you through the process of getting a <a href="personal_insolvency/debt_relief_notices.html">Debt Relief Notice</a>
if this is an appropriate solution for you. MABS can also advise you on how to
access the other personal insolvency options – see below.</p>

<p><strong>Dealing with mortgage arrears:</strong> MABS has a Dedicated
Mortgage Arrears service in over 20 locations. It also operates a court mentor
service, in collaboration with the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI), to
assist debtors faced with court proceedings. <a href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/news/2015/news20151222.html">Read
more about these services</a>.</p>

<p>MABS is also centrally involved in a new aid and advice scheme for people in
serious mortgage arrears, as part of <a href="../../../housing/owning_a_home/mortgage_arrears/aid_and_advice_scheme.html">Abhaile</a>,
the national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service. <a href="http://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/news/2016/news20161003.html">This
service was launched in October 2016</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Contacting MABS:</strong> The MABS Helpline 0761 07 2000 is open
from 9am to 8pm, Monday to Friday. You can also email <a href="mailto:helpline@mabs.ie">helpline@mabs.ie</a> or you can make an

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l1e98f">Personal insolvency options</h2>

<p>Three <a href="personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_options.html">personal
insolvency options</a> have been introduced for people who cannot afford to pay
their personal and mortgage debts. The system of <a href="what_is_bankruptcy.html">bankruptcy</a> has also been updated. The <a href="personal_insolvency/insolvency_service_of_ireland.html">Insolvency
Service of Ireland (ISI)</a> administers all of these debt resolution
processes. It publishes extensive information on <a href="http://www.isi.gov.ie/">its website, isi.gov.ie</a>.</p>

<p>The ISI also has a debtor-focused website <a href="http://backontrack.ie/">backontrack.ie</a>, giving examples of how
individuals have managed to resolve their problem debt, along with step-by-step
guides on dealing with debt. You can use the website to request a callback, or

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="l565b8">What you can do yourself </h2>

<p>If you are in mortgage arrears, or feel you are likely to be in mortgage
arrears soon, the most important step you can take is to <strong>contact your
lender immediately</strong>. You can find out more in <a href="../../../housing/owning_a_home/mortgage_arrears/overview_of_mortgage_debt.html">our
overview of mortgage debt</a>.</p>

<p>For other debts, it is also very important to let your creditors know that
you are having difficulties. Then you will be able to work with them to deal
with the situation. Otherwise the problems and the pressure from creditors will
just get worse.</p>

<p>Even if you have already sought help, you can use the <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/en/how_we_help/debt_and_budgeting_tools/mabs_self_help.html">MABS
self-help tool</a> to help you through the following steps:</p>

<p><strong>1. Assess your situation.</strong> Make a list of all your debts.
Check that each debt is in your name. Identify the debts needing immediate
attention (for example, your mortgage arrears). Get in touch with the lenders
immediately - preferably in writing. There is a <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/downloads/self_help/Contact_Creditors_letter.doc">sample
letter</a> on the MABS website. </p>

<p><strong>2. Make out a budget.</strong> List how much money is coming into
your household each week (or month) and how much is going out. You can get
useful documents like a blank budget sheet and <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/downloads/self_help/Final_MABS_Weekly_Spending_Booklet_v8_27.1.12.pdf">spending
diary (pdf)</a> from the MABS website or request them through the MABS
helpline. </p>

<p>MABS also has a dedicated <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/en/how_we_help/debt_and_budgeting_tools/mabs_budgeting.html">budgeting
tool</a>.</p>

<p><strong>3. Deal with the debt.</strong> Write to the lender, making an offer
of the amount you can afford to pay and explaining your financial situation.
The MABS website has a <a href="https://www.mabs.ie/downloads/self_help/letter_of_offer_text.doc">sample
letter of offer</a> and blank financial statements. </p>

<p><strong>4. Organise a method of paying the agreed amount.</strong> You can
do this in various ways, such as direct debit, internet banking or a MABS
Budget Account.</p>

<div class="topic base_wheretoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_wheretoapply_title" id="lb5ab3">Terminology and procedures</h2>

<p>There are different forms of debt, including mortgages, loans, overdrafts,
credit cards and hire purchase agreements. Some debts, for example, mortgages,
are <em>secured</em> – this means that goods or property, usually your house,
is used as security in case the debt is not paid. Find out more about types of
debt and debt terminology in our <a href="glossary_of_debt_terms.html">glossary of debt terms</a>.</p>

<p>Some debts have specific rules and practices in place in relation to how
they are managed and collected. These are mainly debts which are owed to the
State or a State body. In particular, taxes, social welfare overpayments, local
authority rents and housing loans, utility bills and TV licences all have
specific rules and procedures. Find out more about the <a href="specific_debts.html">rules for specific debts</a>.</p>

<p>There are general rules under consumer credit legislation in relation to <a href="debt_collection.html">collecting debts</a>, including rules in
relation to privacy, contact points and harassment and intimidation. There is a
particular <a href="../../../housing/owning_a_home/mortgage_arrears/consumer_protection_codes_and_mortgages.html">code
of conduct</a> for how lenders must engage with people in mortgage arrears or
pre-arrears.</p>

<p>If you do not engage with your lender, your lender will most likely initiate
<a href="court_procedures.html">legal proceedings to recover the debt</a>.
The case can be taken in the District Court, Circuit Court or High Court,
depending on the amount of money involved. Once your lender has a Court
judgment setting out the debt, this <a href="enforcement_of_judgments.html">judgment can be enforced in various
ways</a>, including, in extreme cases, through <a href="what_is_bankruptcy.html">bankruptcy proceedings</a>. Being in arrears
on debt repayments can also have other consequences, for example, it can affect
your <a href="credit_ratings.html">credit rating</a> and make it difficult
to get credit in the future.</p>

<p>When someone has died, there are detailed rules about <a href="debts_after_death.html">how their debts must be dealt with</a>.</p>

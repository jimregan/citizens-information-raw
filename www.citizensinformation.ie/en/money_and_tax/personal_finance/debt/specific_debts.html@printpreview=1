<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>There are specific rules and practices in place in relation to certain
debts. These are mainly debts that are owed to the State or to a State body and
arise from statutory charges and levies; debts to providers of essential
services, such as utility companies; and debts arising from statutory
obligations, such as the obligation to pay maintenance to spouses and children.
</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/28/enacted/en/html">Civil
Debt (Procedures) Act 2015</a> (when in force) will change the arrangements for
the enforcement of civil debt. <a href="http://www.merrionstreet.ie/en/News-Room/Releases/Government_approves_proposals_on_debt_enforcement_including_water_charge_compliance.html">Read
more in this press release</a>.</p>

<p>Specific rules and practices apply to the following:</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l1cdff">Taxes and charges</h2>

<p>In general, you are expected to pay your taxes on time and in full. If you
fail to do this, Revenue has a range of options for collecting the tax due.</p>

<p><strong>Prosecution</strong></p>

<p>If you fail to pay your tax on time, you may be prosecuted and convicted of
an offence. This may lead to a fine and/or imprisonment. The level of fines and
length of imprisonment vary in accordance with the gravity of the different
offences under revenue law. Regardless of the outcome of the prosecution, you
are still obliged to repay the underpayment.</p>

<p>The main ways in which Revenue collects overdue taxes from individuals are
as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Phased payment arrangements</strong></p>

<p>If you owe money to Revenue for unpaid taxes, you may be able to agree a
repayment arrangement. However, in general, interest applies to any late taxes
and so you have to pay this as well. In some cases, penalties may also
apply.</p>

<p>If you are paying income tax through PAYE and you underpay in a particular
year, you may be able to pay the amount due by having your tax credits in a
subsequent year reduced. In general, interest is not applied in these
circumstances.</p>

<p>In other cases where you have not paid or have underpaid your tax, you may
be able to agree a phased payment arrangement. This generally does involve the
payment of interest as well as the amount owed.</p>

<p><strong>Collection by Sheriff</strong></p>

<p>If you get a final demand for the payment of any taxes due and you do not
respond, Revenue may refer your case to the Sheriff for enforcement. It is not
necessary to have a court order. </p>

<p>The Sheriff is given a warrant, which is a legal document conferring
authority on the Sheriff to enforce collection of Revenue liabilities, if
necessary, by seizing goods. A warrant is valid for 12 months. However, if the
Sheriff fails to collect any of the liability within 6 months, the certificate
must be returned to Revenue. The Sheriff has the authority to negotiate a
payment arrangement, not exceeding 2 years, with you.</p>

<p>Once your case has gone to the Sheriff, you must then deal with the Sheriff.
You cannot now deal with Revenue officials as this is part of Revenue’s
agreement with the Sheriffs. Revenue Sheriffs are officers of the courts and
are responsible to the courts. There is a <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/practitioner/sheriff.pdf">Code of Practice for
Revenue Sheriffs (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Court action</strong></p>

<p>Revenue has contracts with several firms of solicitors to help enforce
Revenue debts. They are involved in <a href="court_procedures.html">taking
cases through the courts</a>. If the court grants a judgment order, it is
enforced in the normal way.</p>

<p><strong>Attachment of a debt</strong></p>

<p>Revenue has specific powers of attachment of debt, which can be exercised
without a court order. <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/practitioner/ebrief/archive/2011/no-862011.html">Read
more about how this works</a>.</p>

<h3>Local Property Tax</h3>

<p>If you are a liable person for the Local Property Tax (LPT) and you do not
submit a return, the estimate made by Revenue will become payable by default.
Revenue will then collect the amount due in the normal ways, such as deduction
at source or attachment order.</p>

<p>If Revenue cannot collect the amount of LPT due, for whatever reason, then a
charge will be put on your property. You will not be able to sell your property
without paying the accumulated tax together with interest and, where
appropriate, penalties.</p>

<p>Read more about the <a href="../../tax/housing_taxes_and_reliefs/local_property_tax.html">Local
Property Tax</a>. </p>

<h3>Household Charge</h3>

<p>A <a href="../../../housing/owning_a_home/home_owners/household_charge.html">Household
Charge</a> of €100 was charged on residential property in 2012. If you owned
a dwelling in 2012 and did not pay the Household Charge due on it by 1 July
2013, the Local Property Tax in respect of the property was increased by
€200. In effect, the arrears were converted into LPT, to be collected through
the LPT system and pursued by Revenue. Interest and penalties under the LPT
system will apply to the additional €200.</p>

<h3>Non-principal private residence (second home) charge</h3>

<p>The <a href="../../../housing/owning_a_home/home_owners/new_local_authority_charges_on_residential_property.html">Non-Principal
Private Residence (NPPR) charge</a> was payable on any second residence that
you owned in any year between 2009 and 2013 inclusive. Late payment fees and
penalties applied if you did not pay the charge by the liability date each
year. If you were liable for the full period and did not pay (or agree terms)
by 31 August 2014, you now owe a total of €7,230 on the property. Any unpaid
charges or unpaid late payment fees remain as a charge on the property and are
payable if it is sold or passed on inheritance.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l3715c">Social welfare overpayments and
maintenance</h2>

<h3>Social welfare overpayments </h3>

<p>If you have received money from the Department of Social Protection that you
should not have received, you are generally legally obliged to repay it. This
is the case whether the overpayment arises as a result of fraud, a mistake by
you or a mistake by the Department.</p>

<p><a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/claiming_a_social_welfare_payment/recovery_of_social_welfare_overpayments.html">Read
more about how the Department deals with social welfare overpayments</a>.</p>

<h3>Maintenance</h3>

<p>If a parent, spouse or civil partner falls behind with maintenance payments
that are due to you under a maintenance order, you can apply to the court for
an attachment of earnings order if the person is in employment or on a private
pension. This order results in the maintenance amount being deducted at source
by the person's employer. If the person is self-employed, you can apply for an
enforcement order.</p>

<p>If the person lives abroad, you can contact the Central Authority for
Maintenance Recovery. You will need to provide the person’s address.</p>

orders and agreements</a>.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l1715d">Local authority arrears</h2>

<h3>Rent arrears</h3>

<p>If you fall behind in your local authority rent, the local authority must
follow the <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad,2061,en.pdf">guidelines
for dealing with arrears (pdf)</a>. Some local authority rent schemes may allow
for a rent reduction in cases of hardship.</p>

<p>If you fail to pay your rent, the legal consequences can include:</p>
<ul><li>Being charged interest at a rate of 6% on the arrears as long as they
    remain unpaid</li>
  <li>Notice to quit, followed by repossession of your home</li>
  <li>Ineligibility for further social housing support </li>
</ul><p>Read more about <a href="../../../housing/local_authority_and_social_housing/rent_arrears.html">how
local authorities deal with rent arrears</a>.</p>

<h3>Local authority loan arrears </h3>

<p>If you have a loan from a local authority for buying or improving your house
and you are having difficulty making your repayments, you may be able to make
an arrangement with the local authority. <a href="http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad,30943,en.pdf">Detailed
guidelines (pdf)</a> have been issued to local authorities on how to deal with
such cases. These guidelines are based on the Central Bank's <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/processes/consumer-protection-code/Documents/2013%20CCMA.pdf">Code
of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (pdf)</a>. </p>

<p>If you fail to pay your arrears, the legal consequences can include:</p>
<ul><li>Being charged interest at a rate of 6% on the arrears as long as they
    remain unpaid</li>
  <li>Repossession of your home</li>
  <li>Ineligibility for further social housing support </li>

<div class="topic base_introduction">
<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="laa9a4">Waste and utility charges</h2>

<h3>Waste charges</h3>

<p>If you have not paid the charge levied by your refuse collection operator
for the collection of waste within 2 months of the due date (and you are not
eligible for a waiver) the operator may take court proceedings against you for

<h3>Utilities: electricity, gas, water</h3>

<p>Suppliers of electricity, gas and water are required by their regulator, the
<a href="http://www.cer.ie">Commission for Energy Regulation (CER)</a>, to have
codes of practice for dealing with customers who have difficulties paying their
bills and build up arrears of payments. Each of these regulated utilities must
publish these codes of practice – you can check on the websites of your <a href="http://www.cer.ie/customer-care/about-us/links#Electricity-Suppliers">electricity
supplier</a>, your <a href="http://www.cer.ie/customer-care/about-us/links#Gas-Suppliers">gas
supplier</a> and <a href="http://www.water.ie/our-customer-commitment/">Irish
Water</a>.</p>

<p>If you are having difficulty (or are likely to have difficulty) paying your
utility bills, it is very important to contact your supplier as soon as
possible. Options that can be put in place with your supplier might include
setting up a budget plan, spreading your payments across the year, installing a
pre-paid meter or using a pre-paid card.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l1340d">TV and dog licences</h2>

<h3>TV licences</h3>

<p>TV licence fees are payable to An Post. (The Minister for Energy,
Communications and Natural Resources may designate another body as the 'issuing
agent' but at present it is An Post.)</p>

<p>If An Post considers that you do not have a TV licence and you are obliged
to have one, it may send you a reminder notification, giving you 28 days to
pay. If, after 2 such notifications, you do not pay the licence fee, An Post
may serve you with a fixed payment notice. </p>

<p>You now have 21 days in which to buy your TV licence and pay the fixed
payment penalty, which is capped at one-third of the licence fee. </p>

<p>If you do not buy your TV licence and pay the fixed payment fee, you may be
prosecuted in the District Court, as it is an offence not to have a TV licence
if you have a TV set. The fine for a first offence can be up to €1,000. For
subsequent offences, you can be fined up to €2,000.</p>

<p>An Post may look for <a href="court_procedures.html">judgment for the
outstanding payments</a> as a simple contract debt.</p>

<h3>Dog licences</h3>

<p>If you have a dog over 4 months old, you must have a dog licence for it. If
you do not have a licence for your dog, you are liable to an 'on-the-spot'
fine. Failure to pay this fine can lead to a prosecution, with a maximum fine
of €2,500 and/or up to 3 months' imprisonment if convicted.</p>

<p>The debt may be collected as a simple contract debt.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="lc55e5">Collection of court fines</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0007/index.html">Fines
(Payments and Recovery) Act 2014</a> introduces some new features in how court
fines are treated, including the possibility of paying a fine by instalments or
of having a fine treated and enforced as a civil debt. </p>

<p>All court fines over €100 can now be paid by instalments, though you can
still opt for a single payment. The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/si/13/made/en/pdf">Fines
(Payments and Recovery) Act 2014 (Section 6) Regulations 2016 (pdf)</a> set out
the arrangements, as follows:</p>

<p>For once-off payment of a fine, you can opt to pay through An Post or else
pay the Courts Service directly.</p>

<p>If you are paying by instalments, you can only pay through An Post. You pay
in 13 instalments. The first instalment is 10% of the amount of the fine and
the next 12 instalments are each 7.5% of the amount of the fine.</p>

<p>There are strict timelines for the payment of instalments, as follows:</p>
<ul><li>The first instalment must be paid 42 days from the date on which the fine
    was imposed</li>
  <li>The second instalment must be paid within 72 days from the date on which
    the fine was imposed</li>
  <li>The third instalment must be paid within 30 days of the due date of the
    second instalment</li>
  <li>Each of the next 9 instalments must be paid within 30 days of the due
    date of the previous instalment</li>
  <li>The 13th and final instalment must be paid within 35 days of the due date
    of the previous (12th) instalment</li>
</ul><p>The Courts Service accepts cash, cheques, bank drafts or postal money
orders. If you are paying through An Post, you can use one of these methods or
choose to pay by credit card or debit card. An Post will accept payments by
phone or over the internet, as well as in post offices.</p>

<p>If you fail to pay a fine, you can be brought back to court. The judge may
make an attachment order or a recovery order, to collect the money from you
directly, or they can order you to do community service. If none of these
options is appropriate, or if you fail to comply with a community service
order, you may be sent to prison for a length of time that relates to the
amount of the unpaid fine.</p>

<p>Budget 2014 was announced on 15 October 2013.</p>

<p>The main Budget changes that may affect people living in Ireland are set out
below. </p>

<p>This document sets out changes in the areas of taxation, social welfare,
health, housing, education, employment and other areas. It is an overview and
not a complete statement of the measures announced in Budget 2014.</p>

<p><strong>This document will be updated throughout the week as more details
become available.</strong></p>

<p>Some of the changes announced in the Budget come into effect immediately.
Others take effect from the beginning of January 2014 or in mid-2014. Many
others have to be finalised before coming into effect. </p>

<p>Some elements of these measures may change when the legislation required to
bring them into effect is enacted. </p>

<p>For a full list of the Budget changes, please see the Department of Finance
website, <a href="http://www.budget.gov.ie">budget.gov.ie</a>. You can find a
summary of the social welfare changes on the Department of Social Protection's
website, <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Budget2014.aspx">welfare.ie</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l01933">Taxation</h2>

<h3>Income tax</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2014, the <strong>One-Parent Family Tax Credit</strong> is to
be replaced with a new Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit. The new credit
will be to the same value but will be available only to the principal carer of
the child.</p>

<p>Tax relief on private <strong>health insurance premiums</strong> will be
limited to €1,000 for each adult insured and €500 for each child. This
change applies to policies which are renewed or entered into on or after 16
October 2013. A child for the purposes of this provision includes a student
over 18 years and under 23 years who is in full-time education. Relief will
continue to be granted at 20%.</p>

<p>A <strong>new Home Renovation Incentive scheme</strong> of tax relief will
be introduced for a period of two years. The scheme provides tax relief for
home renovation work.</p>

<p>To encourage <strong>those who wish to start their own business</strong>, an
exemption from income tax up to a maximum of €40,000 per annum will be
provided for a period of two years, to individuals who set up a qualifying,
un-incorporated business, having been unemployed for a period of at least 15
months prior to establishing the business.</p>

<p><strong>Top Slicing Relief</strong>, which is a reduction of tax due on lump
sum payments when leaving employment, will no longer be available from 1
January 2014 in respect of all ex-gratia lump sum payments.</p>

<p>Lump sum payments to claimants under the <strong>Magdalene Laundry
Fund</strong> will be tax exempt.</p>

<h3>Capital Gains Tax</h3>

<p>The relief from Capital Gains Tax (CGT) (in respect of the first 7 years of
ownership) <strong>for properties purchased between 7 December 2011 and 31
December 2013</strong> is being extended by one year to include properties
bought to the end of 2014. Where property purchased in this period is held for
seven years the gains accrued in that period will not attract CGT.</p>

<p>A <strong>new Capital Gains Tax incentive is being introduced to encourage
entrepreneurs</strong> (in particular "serial" entrepreneurs) to invest and
re-invest in assets used in new productive trading activities. </p>

<p><strong>Capital Gains Tax retirement relief</strong> is being further
extended to disposals of leased land in circumstances where, among other
conditions, the land is leased over the long-term (a minimum lease of 5 years)
and the subsequent disposal is to a person other than a child of the individual
disposing of the farmland. The purpose of the measure is to encourage older
farmers who have no children to whom to transfer their farm to lease out their
farmland over the long term to younger farmers.</p>

<h3>Excise duties</h3>

<p>The excise duty on <strong>a </strong><strong>packet of 20
cigarettes</strong> is being increased by 10 cents (including VAT) with a
pro-rata increase on the other tobacco products, with effect from midnight on
15 October 2013.</p>

<p>The excise duty on <strong>a pint of beer or cider, and on a standard
measure of spirits</strong> is being increased by 10 cent (including VAT); the
duty on <strong>a 75cl bottle of wine</strong> is being increased by 50 cent
(including VAT), with effect from midnight on 15 October 2013.</p>

<h3>VAT</h3>

<p>The <strong>9% reduced VAT rate</strong>, which was introduced in 2011 as
part of the Government Jobs Initiative for tourism-related services, was due to
revert to 13.5% on 31 December 2013. The 9% VAT rate is being retained.</p>

<p>The <strong>annual VAT cash receipts basis threshold</strong> for small to
medium businesses is being increased from €1.25 million to €2 million with
effect from 1 May 2014. This change will assist such businesses in the critical
area of cash-flow and reduce administration.</p>

<p>The <strong>farmer’s flat-rate addition</strong> will be increased from
4.8% to 5% with effect from 1 January 2014. The flat-rate scheme compensates
unregistered farmers for VAT incurred on their farming inputs.</p>

<h3>Other duties and taxes</h3>

<p>The rate of <strong>Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT)</strong>, together
with the rates of exit tax that apply to life assurance policies and investment
funds, is being increased and will now be 41% whether payments are made
annually or more frequently (previously 33%) or are made less frequently than
annually (previously 36%). The increased rates will apply to payments,
including deemed payments, made on or after 1 January 2014.</p>

<p>The 0.6% <strong>stamp duty levy on pension fund assets</strong> is to
increase to 0.75% for the year 2014. The levy will be reduced to 0.15% for
2015.</p>

<p>The Government has decided that a specific contribution to the Exchequer is
to be obtained from <strong>the financial sector</strong> for the period 2014
to 2016. The contribution will be related to the amount of tax paid on deposit
interest by the institution in the calendar year 2011. Full details will be
contained in the Finance Bill.</p>
</div>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="lae27e">Social Welfare</h2>

<p>In 2014 €19.6 billion is to be spent on social protection in 2014. New
spending reductions have been limited to €226 million. The Department of
Social Protection has received an increased capital allocation of €15 million
to roll out Intreo centres fully.</p>

<p>There are <strong>no changes to the rates of primary weekly social welfare
payments and pensions</strong>.</p>

<h3>Jobseeker’s Allowance and Supplementary Welfare Allowance</h3>

<p>From 14 January 2014 people without children getting Jobseeker’s Allowance
who are aged between 18 and 24 years will receive €100 per week. Existing
claimants aged between 18 and 24 on a higher rate will have no change in their
rate. This provision applies to Supplementary Welfare Allowance recipients from
9 January.</p>

<p>From 14 January 2014 people without children getting Jobseeker’s Allowance
aged 25 years will receive €144 a week. Existing claimants aged 25 on a
higher rate will have no change in their rate. This weekly €144 rate will
increase to €188 when they reach 26 years of age. This provision applies to
Supplementary Welfare Allowance recipients from 9 January.</p>

<p>From 14 January 2014 these reduced rates of Jobseeker’s Allowance will
apply to people aged 25 and under who have exhausted their entitlement to
Jobseeker’s Benefit.</p>

<p></p>

  2014</strong></caption>
  <col><col><col><col><tbody><tr><td>Maximum personal rate aged 26 years or over</td>
      <td>€188</td>

      <td>€100</td>
      <td>Increase for a qualified adult</td>
      <td>€100</td>
    </tr></tbody></table><p></p>

<p>Currently, all Jobseeker's Allowance and Supplementary Welfare Allowance
recipients, regardless of age, who have children continue to receive a personal
rate of €188 (JA) or €186 (SWA) per week and an increase for a qualified
adult, if applicable, of €124.80 plus qualified child increases. There are no
changes to those arrangements.</p>

<p>The HSE care provision for people getting JA is also extended to age 24
(from 21). So, for example, a person aged 20 who is in receipt of a JA rate of
€188 because they were in the care of the HSE during their 17th year can
remain on this rate up to age 24.</p>

<h3>Returning to education or training</h3>

<p>From 14 January 2014 people aged 25 will get an age-reduced rate of
Jobseeker’s Allowance of €144. If they take part in the Back to Education
Scheme (BTEA) they will get a standard maximum rate of €160 per week. </p>

<p>All new BTEA participants aged under 26 who were getting a reduced
age-related Jobseeker’s Allowance payment, will get a maximum BTEA rate of
€160 per week (any means participants have will be deducted from this
rate).</p>

<p>People aged 25 who were getting an age-related reduced rate of Jobseeker’s
Allowance will also get a standard weekly allowance of €160 if they take part
in a FÁS course, the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) or a
Youthreach course.</p>

<h3>Maternity Benefit and Adoptive Benefit</h3>

<p>From 6 January 2014 the minimum and maximum rates of Maternity Benefit and
Adoptive Benefit will be standardised at €230 per week for new applicants.
This will result in an increase of up to €12.20 for those receiving less than
€230 per week and a reduction of up to €32 per week for all other
claimants. The change will apply to new claimants. Existing claimants will not
be affected.</p>

<h3>Illness Benefit</h3>

<p>From 6 January 2014 no Illness Benefit payment will be made for the first 6
days of illness (up from 3 days). This means that a person will not be entitled
to Illness Benefit for the first 6 days of their claim.</p>

<h3>Rent and Mortgage Interest Supplements</h3>

<p>From January 2014 the minimum contribution towards Rent Supplement and
Mortgage Interest Supplement for couples will be increased by €5 per week,
from €35 to €40. This aligns Rent and Mortgage Interest Supplement
contributions with the local authority rents structure. This change applies to
new and existing recipients.</p>

<p>The minimum contribution for single people, including single people with
children (currently €30), will not change.</p>

<p>The Mortgage Interest Supplement (MIS) scheme will be closed to new entrants
and will be wound down for existing recipients over a 4-year period from 1
January 2014.</p>

<h3>Child Benefit</h3>

<p>There are no new changes to Child Benefit in Budget 2014. Child Benefit will
be standardised at €130 per month for each child from January 2014, as
announced in Budget 2013.</p>

<h3>Breakfast clubs</h3>

<p>Extra Breakfast Clubs will be provided to support school-going children in
disadvantaged areas.</p>

<h3>Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance</h3>

<p>The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance is unchanged for all
children under 18. In 2014 it will continue to be paid for those aged 18 years
and over who are in second-level education only, not in third-level
education.</p>

<h3>Household Benefits Package</h3>

<p>From January 2014 the Telephone Allowance will be discontinued for existing
and new recipients. The value of the allowance is €9.50 per month per
household. The Free TV Licence and Electricity Allowance or Gas Allowance paid
under the Household Benefits Package will continue to be paid with no changes
to rates. There are no changes to the Free Travel Scheme and the Fuel Allowance
Scheme.</p>

<p>In 2014 the annual payment to RTÉ for the Free TV Licence will reduce by
€5 million to €54.17 million. This will not affect recipients who will
continue to get a free TV licence.</p>

<h3>State Pension Transition</h3>

<p>As previously announced the State Pension (Transition) will no longer be
paid from January 2014.</p>

<h3>Invalidity Pension</h3>

<p>The higher weekly Invalidity Pension rate of €230.30 paid when claimants
reach age 65 will be discontinued. The rate payable to people aged 65 (and
under) will be €193.50 per week. It will apply to people claiming Invalidity
Pension who reach their 65th birthday from 2 January 2014. Existing 65 year
olds are unaffected. This measure is being undertaken in line with the
abolition of the State Pension (Transition) from January 2014.</p>

<p>People who are getting Invalidity Pension (existing and new recipients) will
continue to be automatically transferred to State Pension (Contributory) at age
66 and they will receive a weekly rate of €230.30.</p>

<p>The weekly rate payable to all qualified adults of people claiming
Invalidity Pension will be standardised at €138.10 per week. This measure
will apply to spouses and partners aged 66 or over who reach their 66th
birthday from 2 January 2014. Existing spouses and partners aged 66 and over
are unaffected.</p>

<h3>Bereavement Grant</h3>

<p>From January 2014 the Bereavement Grant of €850 will be discontinued.</p>

<p>The Funeral Grant under the Occupational Injuries Scheme will continue to be
paid. The six weeks' payment after death (where the deceased person’s payment
continues for 6 weeks to their spouse or partner who is also getting a weekly
welfare payment), the Widowed or Surviving Civil Partner’s Grant of €6,000
and assistance with funeral costs under Exceptional Needs Payments are
unaffected.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous savings</h3>

<p>In 2014 savings of €2.1 million will be achieved in Exceptional Needs
Payments (under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme) arising through the
standardisation of payments.</p>

<p>The value of certain social welfare payments will be recovered by the
Department of Social Protection from insurance companies in respect of
compensation awards arising from an accident or injury. Savings of €21
million will be made from this reform measure.</p>

<p>Additional savings of €30 million will be realised in fraud and control
measures during 2014.</p>

<h4>Home Renovation Incentive</h4>

<p>A scheme of tax relief for home renovation work is being introduced for a
period of 2 years.</p>

<p>The Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) will provide an income tax credit of up
to €4,050 to homeowners who carry out renovation and improvement works on
their principal private residences in 2014 and 2015. It will be payable over
the 2 years following the year in which the work is carried out. The credit
will be calculated at a rate of 13.5% on all qualifying expenditure over
€5,000, up to a maximum of €30,000.</p>

<p>Qualifying works include extensions and renovations to the home,
window-fitting, plumbing, tiling and plastering. Builders must be fully
tax-compliant and all expenditure and relief claims will have to be registered
electronically with the Revenue Commissioners.</p>

<h4>Investment projects</h4>

<p>€30 million is allocated to <strong>recommence the State’s
house-building programme</strong>. This will facilitate up to 500 additional
housing units between a small number of new infill developments and the return
of previously uninhabitable units to the housing stock.</p>

<p>€10 million will be provided for an <strong>unfinished housing estate
resolution initiative</strong> where there is no development bond to carry out
essential public works such as footpaths, drainage and roads. </p>

<p>Investments by NAMA will include the <strong>construction of 4,500 new
houses and apartments in Dublin</strong>.</p>

<p>Part of the €200 million to be invested from the sale of the National
Lottery licence in 2014 will be allocated to the <strong>Better Energy
Programme</strong> and for up to 5,700 <strong>housing adaptation grants for
older people and people with a disability</strong>.</p>

<p>€10 million is allocated to resolve the problems at <strong>Priory

<p>A new model of financing social interventions, to be called '<strong>Social
Impact Investment</strong>' will aim to use private capital to provide better
outcomes for citizens. The pilot phase is seeking private sector investment
partners to provide long-term homes for over 130 homeless families in the
Dublin region. A total of €45 million is being provided for homeless
accommodation.</p>

<p>There will also be a <strong>new insulation scheme for local authority
housing</strong>. It is expected that the €25 million being provided will
improve the energy efficiency of 12,500 local authority homes.</p>

<p>€79 million will be provided for <strong>housing regeneration</strong>.</p>

<p>Up to 150 new leased units will be provided for <strong>people with
disabilities who are leaving institutional care</strong> and 175 new housing

<p>The <strong>Living City Initiative</strong> is being extended to Cork,
Galway, Kilkenny and Dublin. The eligibility criteria will now include all
buildings built prior to 1915. The initiative aims to assist the regeneration
of retail and commercial districts and encourage families to live in historic
buildings in city centres. EU state-aid approval will be required.</p>

<h3>Employment and Business</h3>

<p></p>

<h4>Small and medium businesses</h4>

<p>A <strong>Start Your Own Business (SYOB)</strong> measure is being
introduced to encourage people who are long-term unemployed to start their own
unincorporated business, by providing a two-year exemption from income tax (up
to a maximum of €40,000 per year) for people who have been unemployed for at
least 15 months prior to starting their own business.</p>

<p><strong>Local Enterprise Offices</strong> will get additional funding of
€3.5 million for investment in supports for start-ups and growing
businesses.</p>

<p><strong>Trading-online voucher scheme</strong>: In 2014 €5 million will be
provided to assist the rollout of a national trading-online voucher scheme,
aimed at getting 2,000 small Irish businesses trading online. Under a pilot
scheme being launched in October 2013, vouchers of up to €2,500 will be
provided to 50 small companies to help them develop an online trading presence.
The scheme will be administered by the Dublin City Enterprise Board and will
target small enterprises that employ fewer than 10 people and have a turnover
of less than €2m per annum.</p>

<p><strong>Credit Review Office</strong>: the threshold for credit applications
that can be reviewed by the Credit Review Office is being increased from
€500,000 to €3 million.</p>

<p>The <strong>VAT cash threshold</strong> for small and medium enterprises
will increase from €1.25 million to €2 million with effect from 1 May
2014.</p>

<p>A new <strong>SME Communications Strategy</strong> will aim to increase
awareness of State supports amongst small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and to
ensure that there is a greater awareness amongst businesses of the Credit
Guarantee Scheme, which will soon be re-launched.</p>

<p>A new <strong>Building Business Capacity</strong> programme, consisting of 2
days dedicated off-site training and expert mentoring support, will aim to
enhance the business and financial capacity of SMEs in relation to
understanding and using a broader range of financial products, as well as
equipping them with tools needed to make a strong business case when applying
for credit. The programme will be launched on a pilot basis, with 1,000 SMEs
expected to take part in 2014.</p>

<h4>Supports for investment in business</h4>

<p><strong>Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)</strong>: it has been agreed
with the Department of Justice to propose the inclusion of REITs as an
investment option in the Immigrant Investor Programme.</p>

<p><strong>Research and Development Tax Credit</strong>: the amount of
expenditure eligible for the R&amp;D Tax Credit on a full volume basis (without
reference to the 2003 base year) is being increased from €200,000 to
€300,000. The limit on the amount of R&amp;D expenditure that can be
outsourced will increase from10% to 15%.</p>

<p><strong>Capital Gains Tax</strong>: A new relief from Capital Gains Tax is
being introduced to encourage entrepreneurs who reinvest the proceeds from the
disposal of assets, on which CGT has previously been paid, into a new
investment in productive trading activities. The measure will apply where
someone who has already paid CGT on the disposal of assets invests in a new
business in the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2018 and subsequently
disposes of this investment no earlier than three years after the date of
investment. The relief will be a tax credit equal to (i) the lower of the CGT
paid on the previous asset disposal or (ii) 50% of the CGT due on any gain from
the future disposal of the new investment. EU state-aid approval is required
for this measure.</p>

<p><strong>Employment and Investment Incentive</strong>: The initial 30% relief
available for investments under the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII)
is being removed from the high earners restriction for a period of 3 years.
This restriction limits the amount of tax reliefs that can be claimed by high
income individuals. The EII provides that a maximum of €150,000 can be
invested by an individual per annum. Therefore, by lifting the restriction on
the initial 30% relief, these investors should be encouraged to invest more
funds in the EII and improve the availability of funds to SMEs.</p>

<h4>Supports for unemployed people</h4>

<p>It is estimated that spending on schemes such as Community Employment, Tús
and JobBridge will be €1.08 billion in 2014.</p>

<p>Provision of part-time childcare places for Community Employment
participants under the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) scheme
is to be introduced in early 2014.</p>

<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Child Benefit (previously known as <span>Children's Allowance</span>) is
payable to the parents or guardians of children under 16 years of age, or under
18 years of age if the child is in full-time education, <a shape="rect" href="/en/education/vocational_education_and_training/training_and_apprentiship_programmes/youthreach.html">Youthreach
training</a> or has a disability. Child Benefit is not paid on behalf of
18-year olds. </p>

<p>For twins, Child Benefit is paid at one and a half times the normal monthly
rate for each child. For triplets and other multiple births, Child Benefit is
paid at double the normal monthly rate for each child.</p>

<p>Some Child Benefit customers are currently being registered for a <a href="../../irish_social_welfare_system/public_services_card.html">Public
Services Card</a> by the Department of Social Protection. </p>

<h3>Budget 2016</h3>

<p>The rate of Child Benefit increased by €5 to €140 per month for each
child from January 2016. </p>

  <li>The month the family came to live in Ireland. </li>
</ul><h3>Birth of your baby</h3>

<p>If your baby is born in Ireland, when you <a shape="rect" href="/en/birth_family_relationships/after_your_baby_is_born/registering_birth_your_baby.html">register
the birth of your baby</a> the Department of Social Protection will begin a

<h3>Child Benefit and EU Regulations</h3>

<p><span>EU/EEA citizens</span> and Swiss nationals <span>working</span> in

covered by EU Regulations, the country you work in usually pays Child Benefit
<span>even if</span> your family is living in another country. However, if your
children are living in another EU/EEA country you should still apply for any
Family Benefits you are entitled to there. </p>

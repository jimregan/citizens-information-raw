<h2>The Universal Social Charge (USC) has replaced the income levy from 1
January 2011</h2>

<p>A new <a href="universal_social_charge.html">Universal Social Charge</a>
was announced in Budget 2011 that replaced both the income levy and the health
levy from 1 January 2011. </p>

<p>Medical card holders who were previously exempt from the income levy may
have to pay the USC.</p>

<p>You can find out more about the Universal Social Charge in <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/usc/universal-social-charge-faqs.pdf">Revenue's
Frequently Asked Questions document</a> (pdf).</p>

<p></p>

<p>The income levy was calculated separately from income tax. It was charged on
your gross income, before deductions, for example, capital allowances or
contributions to pensions. You could not claim deductions or credits to reduce
the amount of levy you must pay. The levy is collected from your gross income.
Similarly, excess or unused tax credits could not be used to reduce your
liability to the levy.</p>

<p>If you were a <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/starting_work_and_changing_job/starting_work/tax_and_starting_work.html">PAYE
taxpayer</a> your employer was responsible for deducting the levy from your
wages. You got an <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/forms/end-year-income-levy-certificate-2010.pdf">End
of year - Income levy Certificate (pdf)</a> if you were in employment.</p>

<p>When you left a job you should have got an <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/forms/income-levy-certificate-2010.pdf">Income
Levy Certificate (pdf)</a> from your employer. This certificate is for your own
records. </p>

<p>The income levy was payable on gross income from most sources before any tax
reliefs, capital allowances, losses, pension contributions or PRSI.</p>

<h3>You had to pay the income levy if:</h3>
<ul><li>You were under 65 and your gross income was above €15,028 per year or
    €289 per week </li>
</ul><p><strong>Or</strong></p>
<ul><li>You were aged 65 or over and your annual gross income was more than
    €20,000 for a single person or €40,000 for a married couple. </li>

    a specified limit </li>

    </strong>more than €20,000 for a single individual or €40,000 for a
    married couple </li>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l62fd2">Rates</h2>

<p>Deductions were made by your employer weekly or monthly, depending on how
you were paid. Income levy deductions are not cumulative.</p>

<h3>From 1 January 2010</h3>

<p>Income levy rates were as follows:</p>
<ul><li>2% on income up to €75,036 </li>
  <li>4% on income from €75,037 to €174,980 </li>
  <li>6% on income above €174,980. </li>
</ul><p>If your income was greater than the minimum threshold of €15,028 per year
or €289 per week, you paid the levy on the full amount of your income. (If
you were aged 65 or over the minimum threshold was €20,000 per year for a
single person and €40,000 per year for a couple).</p>

<h3>Married couples (under 65)</h3>

<p>The income thresholds applied to each spouse individually and cannot be
combined if one spouse is below the threshold and the other above. For example,
if you earned €14,000 per year and your spouse earned €20,000 per year, you
were not liable to pay the income levy but your spouse was.</p>

<h3>PAYE taxpayers (under 65)</h3>

<p>Your employer calculated the income levy on a week by week or month by month
basis. If your income varied from week to week you could pay the income levy at
a higher rate than you were actually liable to pay but in such a case you
should get a refund. </p>

<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" border="1" width="700" summary=""><thead><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>Example 1</strong></td>
    </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Your yearly income is less than €15,028.
        However, in July 2010 you get a bonus which means your income goes over
        the weekly minimum threshold of €289. The result is your full income
        that week is subject to the income levy.</p>

        <p>At the end of the year, if your annual income is not more than
        €15,028 then you do not have to pay the income levy. </p>

        <p>In this situation your employer should make an adjustment at the end
        of the year (week 52) and refund all income levy deducted from your
        wages. If you have not worked with the same employer continuously
        throughout the year Revenue will deal with any refund of income levy
        due at the end of the year.</p>

        threshold of 2% for income up to €1,443, 4% from €1,443 to
        €3,365, and 6% on the balance. If you get a payment for one week in
        excess of €3,365 you will pay the income levy at the 6% on the
        balance.</p>

        <p>If your yearly income means you are liable at a lower rate, you will
        have overpaid the income levy. In this situation your employer should
        make an adjustment at the end of the year (week 52) and make the
        appropriate refund. If you have not worked with the same employer
        continuously throughout the year Revenue will deal with any refund of
        income levy due at the end of the year.</p>

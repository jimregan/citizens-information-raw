<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are thinking of setting up a business there are a number of issues
you need to consider. Different supports and regulations apply, depending on
your particular situation. You may be employed, unemployed or someone who is
coming from outside Ireland to set up a business. This document highlights some
of the important information you need to know with links to relevant topics.
You can read more in our documents, <a href="sources_information_on_starting_business.html">Sources of information
on starting a business</a> and <a href="self_employment_as_an_individual.html">Becoming self-employed</a>. </p>

<h3>Business planning</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.localenterprise.ie/News-and-Events/Local-Enterprise-Offices-Open-for-Business.html">Local
Enterprise Offices</a> provide supports to local businesses that are starting
up or in development. Their role is to stimulate economic activity at local
level and to promote microenterprises (10 or fewer employees). You can find
information about their <a href="https://www.localenterprise.ie/Discover-Business-Supports/Training-Programmes/">training
programmes</a> and <a href="https://www.localenterprise.ie/Discover-Business-Supports/Training-Programmes/Start-Your-Own-Business-Programme/">start
your own business courses</a> as well as <a href="https://www.localenterprise.ie/Discover-Business-Supports/Mentoring/">mentoring</a>
and <a href="https://www.localenterprise.ie/Discover-Business-Supports/Financial-Supports/">financial
supports</a> on <a href="https://www.localenterprise.ie/">localenterprise.ie</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.enterprise-ireland.com/en/Start-a-Business-in-Ireland/Supports-for-High-Potential-Start-Ups/New-Frontiers-Entrepreneur-Development-Programme.html">New
Frontiers is a development programme for potential entrepreneurs,</a> funded
and coordinated by Enterprise Ireland, which is delivered locally by Institutes
of Technology.</p>

<h3>Unemployed people</h3>

<p>If you are unemployed you may be eligible for the <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_and_work/back_to_work_enterprise_allowance.html">Back
to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA)</a> or the <a href="../../../social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_and_work/short_term_enterprise_allowance.html">Short-Term
Enterprise Allowance (STEA)</a>. If you are starting a business, you also may
get extra supports under these schemes, such as grants for training, market
research and business plans as well as access to loans to buy equipment. </p>

<p>The <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/start_your_own_business_scheme.html">Start
Your Own Business Relief</a> provides relief from income tax to people who are
unemployed for at least 12 months and who set up a qualifying business. It runs
from 23 October 2013 to 31 December 2016.</p>

<h3>Foreign nationals</h3>

<p>Nationals of the <a shape="rect" href="/en/moving_country/moving_to_ireland/rights_of_residence_in_ireland/residence_rights_eu_national.html">European
Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland</a> do not need permission to set up a
business in Ireland. Generally, non-EEA nationals must get permission from the
Minister for Justice and Equality in order <a shape="rect" href="coming_to_set_up_a_business_in_ireland.html">to set up a business in
Ireland</a>. They may be eligible to apply for the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/New%20Programmes%20for%20Investors%20and%20Entrepreneurs">Immigrant
Investor Programme or the Start-up Entrepreneur Programme.</a> If they wish to
start a retail, catering, personal services or similar business they should

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lc607a">Legal structures</h2>

<p>You can set up a business as a sole trader, as a partnership or as a limited
company. The type of structure you choose depends on the kind of business you
are running, with whom you will be doing business and your attitude to risk. It
is advisable to get the advice of a solicitor or accountant when considering
the structure for your business. The Companies Registration Office (CRO) has <a href="https://www.cro.ie/Registration/Overview">information about these
different structures on its website, cro.ie</a>.</p>

<h3>Sole trader</h3>

<p>It is relatively simple to set up as a sole trader but if your business
fails, your personal assets could be used to pay your creditors. Your main
legal obligation is that you must register as a self-employed person with
Revenue (see ‘Tax and PRSI’ below). If you wish to use a business name you
must <a shape="rect" href="https://www.cro.ie/Registration/Business-Name">register your business
name</a> with the Companies Registration Office (CRO). </p>

<h3>Partnership</h3>

<p>This is where 2 or more people agree to run a business in partnership with
each other. The partnership agreement should be drawn up by a solicitor. The
partners are jointly responsible for running the business and if it fails all
partners are jointly responsible for the debt. </p>

<h3>Limited company</h3>

<p>If you set up your business as a limited company, the business is a separate
legal entity. If the company gets into debt, the creditors generally only have
a claim on the assets of the company. The company must be registered with the
<a shape="rect" href="http://www.cro.ie/">Companies Registration Office
(CRO)</a> and the company reports and accounts must be returned to the CRO each
year. </p>

<p><strong>Companies Act 2014</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/act/38/enacted/en/html">Companies
Act 2014</a>, which replaced the Companies Acts 1963-2013, came into effect on
1 June 2015. Under the Act, all existing private companies limited by shares
must <a href="https://www.cro.ie/New-Act-2014/Need-to-Convert">choose to
convert</a> to either an <a href="https://www.cro.ie/New-Act-2014/Need-to-Convert/LTD-Company">LTD (private
company limited by shares)</a> or a <a href="https://www.cro.ie/New-Act-2014/Need-to-Convert/Designated-Activity-Company">DAC
(Designated Activity Company)</a>. Apart from certain exemptions, guarantee
companies and unlimited companies are required to <a href="https://www.cro.ie/New-Act-2014/Change-of-Company-Name">change their
names</a> under the Act.</p>

<p>You can register your business name and file company returns online with the
CRO using <a shape="rect" href="http://www.core.ie/">CORE (Companies Online
Registration Environment)</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="lbe261">Funding </h2>

<p><a href="http://microfinanceireland.ie/">Microfinance Ireland</a> provides
loans to small businesses with no more than 10 employees, including sole
traders and start-ups. The loans of between €2,000 and €25,000 are for
commercially viable proposals. Since September 2015, under the <a href="https://www.djei.ie/en/News-And-Events/Department-News/2015/September/25092015.html">Microenterprise
Loan Fund Scheme 2015,</a> there is no longer a requirement to have been
refused credit by the banks. <a href="http://microfinanceireland.ie/wordpress/index.php/how-to-apply/">Forms
and details of how to apply</a> are available on microfinance.ie.</p>

<p><a href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/employment_support_schemes/jobsplus.html">JobsPlus</a>
is an employer incentive which encourages and rewards employers who employ
jobseekers on the Live Register. There are 2 levels of incentive: €7,500 for
recruits unemployed for more than 12 but less than 24 months and €10,000 for
recruits unemployed for more than 24 months. Eligible employers who recruit
full-time employees on or after 1 July 2013 may apply for the incentive.
JobsPlus has replaced the Revenue Job Assist and Employer Job (PRSI) Exemption
Scheme both of which ended on 30 June 2013, but existing participants on these
schemes will not be affected. </p>

<p>Under the <a href="https://www.localenterprise.ie/Discover-Business-Supports/Trading-Online-Voucher-Scheme-/">Trading
Online Voucher Scheme</a> vouchers of up to €2,500 may be available to
businesses who demonstrate that they have a credible plan for trading online.
Further details are available from your <a href="https://www.localenterprise.ie/Find-Your-Local-Enterprise-Office/">Local
Enterprise Office</a>.</p>

<h3>Credit difficulties</h3>

<p>If you have a small or medium business and your application for credit is
refused by one of the participating banks you may <a href="http://www.creditreview.ie/how-to-apply/">apply to the Credit Review
Office</a> to have your case reviewed. <a href="http://www.creditreview.ie/am-i-eligible/">To be eligible for a
review</a> your application must have been in writing. There is an <a href="http://www.creditreview.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BorrowerApplicationForm.doc">application
form</a> on the website of the Credit Review Office. The fee for the review
ranges from €100 up to a maximum of €250.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Supports-for-SMEs/Access-to-Finance/SME-Credit-Guarantee-Scheme/">Credit
Guarantee Scheme</a> aims to encourage additional lending to small and medium
businesses who are commercially viable but have difficulty in accessing credit.
Under the Scheme eligible applicants will be assisted in obtaining a loan and
in establishing a favourable credit history. Since 23 February 2015, <a href="https://www.djei.ie/en/News-And-Events/Department-News/2015/February/23022015.html">changes
to the Credit Guarantee Scheme</a> include increasing the maximum length of the
guarantee from 3 to 7 years. Also, the Scheme now allows for refinancing loans
where the business’s bank is exiting the Irish credit market.</p>

<h3>Tax</h3>

<p>How your business is taxed depends on whether it is incorporated as a
company. If it is a company then it is liable for <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/ct/index.html">corporation tax</a>. If your
business is not incorporated you are considered to be a sole trader and you pay
tax under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it10.html">self-assessment
system</a>. Further information on tax is available in our document on <a href="../../../money_and_tax/tax/income_tax/taxation_of_self_employed_people.html">tax
for self-employed people</a> and <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/running/registering-tax.html">from
Revenue</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Earned Income tax credit:</strong> Starting in 2016, taxpayers
earning self-employed trading or professional income may claim a new <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/practitioner/ebrief/2015/no-1162015.html">Earned
Income tax credit of €550</a>. It is also available for business owners or
managers who are not eligible for a PAYE credit on their salary income. If a
taxpayer also qualifies for the PAYE tax credit, the combined value of these 2
tax credits cannot exceed €1,650.</p>

<p><strong>SURE tax refund:</strong> The <a href="http://www.djei.ie/en/News-And-Events/Department-News/2015/May/Government-cash-for-startups-through-SURE-tax-refund-%E2%80%93-Minister-Bruton-Minister-Noonan-.html">Start
Up Refunds for Entrepreneurs (SURE)</a> is a tax refund scheme that allows
eligible people to get a refund of up to 41% of the capital they invest in
starting a business. Under the SURE scheme you may be entitled to a refund of
PAYE income tax that you paid over the 6 years before the year in which you
invest. You can read the <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/it15.html">Revenue guide IT15
for further details of the SURE scheme</a>. You can use the <a href="http://www.sure.gov.ie/Calculator">online calculator on sure.gov.ie</a>
to estimate your potential refund.</p>

<p><strong>Start-up companies:</strong> New companies may get tax relief on the
first 3 years of corporation tax and the value of the relief will be linked to
the amount of employers’ PRSI paid by a company in an accounting period
subject to a maximum of €5,000 per employee. In the Finance Act 2013, the <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/practitioner/tax-briefing/archive/2013/no-022013.html">tax
relief was extended</a> to allow any unused relief arising in the first 3 years
of trading to be carried forward for use in subsequent years. The relief was
extended to companies that started trading in 2012, 2013, 2014 or 2015 and, in
the Finance Act 2015, to companies that start trading in 2016, 2017 or 2018.</p>

<p><strong>Capital Gains Tax (CGT) relief:</strong> If you sell your business
on or after 1 January 2016, a lower CGT rate of 20% will apply to the net
chargeable gains arising from the sale of all or part of your business, up to a
lifetime limit of €1 million.</p>

<h3>PRSI</h3>

<p>If you are self-employed you pay <a href="../../../social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/class_S_prsi.html">Class
S social insurance contributions</a>. There is a guide, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Publications/SW74/Pages/1WhatbenefitsmayIgetbypayingClassSPRSI.aspx">PRSI
for the Self-Employed</a> on welfare.ie.</p>

<p>If you are an employer and you created new and additional jobs in 2012 you
may have <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/employer_job_prsi_incentive_scheme.html">qualified
for an exemption of employer’s PRSI for those jobs</a>. In 2013 this scheme
was replaced by the <a href="http://www.djei.ie/press/2013/20130708.htm">JobsPlus incentive,</a> which
aims to encourage employers to hire individuals that are long-term unemployed -
see 'Funding' above.</p>

<h3>Employing staff</h3>

<p>If you are starting up a business and decide to recruit staff <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/employers-paye.html">you must register
for PAYE and PRSI</a> with Revenue. You can find information in our document
about your <a href="../../employment_rights_and_conditions/employment_rights_and_duties/employer_obligations.html">obligations
and duties as an employer and what are the rights of employees.</a> There is a

for employers who are starting a new business with a paid employee (pdf)</a>.

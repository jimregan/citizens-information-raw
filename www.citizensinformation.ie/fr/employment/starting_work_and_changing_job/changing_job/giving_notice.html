<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are changing your job, you are <span>required</span> by law to give
your present employer notice of your decision to leave. The actual length of
the notice you are required to give will <span>depend on your contract of
employment</span> and on the <span>minimum notice</span> that you are required
to give by law. The principal legislation governing this area employment law in
Ireland is the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1973/en/act/pub/0004/index.html">Minimum
Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973–2005.</a> You can read more in our
document about <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/losing_your_job/losing_job_entitlements.html">minimum
periods of notice from employers</a>.</p>

<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<h3>Contract of employment</h3>

<p>A <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/contracts_of_employment/contract_of_employment.html">contract
of employment</a> may be agreed by word of mouth or may be set out in writing.
Requirements as to notice are among the items in a contract of employment that
should, by law, be in written form. You should therefore check your contract of
employment for any provisions as to the notice you are required to give and
follow those provisions. Remember that it is always open to agree a different
arrangement to that contained in your contract with your employer.</p>

<h3>Statutory minimum notice</h3>

<p>If you do not have a provision in your contract of employment dealing with
notice, the <span>statutory minimum notice of one week</span> will apply and
this is the notice that you should give your employer of your intention to
leave. The statutory minimum notice of one week, is set down in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1973/en/act/pub/0004/sec0006.html#zza4y1973s6">Section
6</a> of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973.</p>

<h3>Situations where notice is not required</h3>

<p>An employer is entitled to at least one week's notice from an employee who
has been working for the employer for 13 weeks or more. If an employee has been
working for an employer for less than 13 weeks and has no contractual
obligation to give notice then the employee is not obliged to give notice. </p>

<p>An employer is not bound to give an employee the minimum notice of one week
if the employee has been working for the employer for less than 13 weeks or in
situations where the employee is guilty of gross misconduct.</p>

<h3>Waiving your right to notice</h3>

<p>Employment legislation also sets down that if an employer and an employee
agree, the employee can waive their right to notice. In addition, where the
employer and employee agree, the employer can pay the employee in lieu of
notice. If you accept payment in lieu of notice, then the date of termination
of your employment is the date on which notice (if it had been given) would
have expired. These rights are set down in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1973/en/act/pub/0004/sec0007.html#zza4y1973s7">Section
7</a> of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973. </p>

<p>The legislation does not address the use of annual leave due in lieu of
notice. This is a matter for agreement between employer and employee. However
any employee leaving a job is entitled to payment for any outstanding <a shape="rect" href="../../rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/annual_leave_public_holidays.html">annual
leave</a>.</p>

<h3>Changing your mind</h3>

<p>Once given, you <span>cannot</span> withdraw your notice to terminate your
employment, unless you can reach an agreement with your employer to do so. </p>

<p>The statutory minimum notice requirement by an employee is contained in the
the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973–2005.</p>

<div class="topic base_rates">
<h2 class="topic base_rates_title" id="l44197">Obtaining references when leaving
employment</h2>

<p>If you are moving to a new employer you may want to ask your current or
former employer for a reference. This can be written or oral. A written
reference may be entirely factual describing, for example, how long you have
worked for the particular employer, the level of decision making for which you
were responsible or your absentee rate. It may also include an appraisal by the
employer of how you carried out your work and your suitability for a particular
position. </p>

<h3>Entitlement to a reference </h3>

<p>You do not have a statutory entitlement to either a written or an oral
reference from your current or previous employer. Your contract of employment
may explicitly state that the employer will provide a reference when you leave
but this seems to be rare. It is the custom and practice of certain employers
and some sectors to provide references and such a custom or practice may be
regarded as part of your terms and conditions of employment. This depends on
the facts in each individual case. If an employer gives a reference to one
employee but not to another, the issue of discrimination could arise. </p>

<h3>Employer’s responsibility </h3>

<p>The employer has a duty of care to you and to the prospective new employer.
If your employer does give you a reference, it must be true, fair, accurate and
not misleading. </p>

<p>If you are given a reference which you consider to be unfair or inaccurate,
you may be able to sue that employer for negligence. You would have to show
that you suffered a loss, for example, that a job offer was withdrawn as a
result of the reference. If you consider that the reference is defamatory, you
may seek redress under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0031/index.html">Defamation
Act 2009</a>. </p>

<p>A prospective employer who is misled by an inaccurate reference may make a
negligence claim against the employer who provided the reference.</p>

<h3>Access to a reference </h3>

<p>Written references are part of your personnel records. Oral references may
also be if the new employer made a note of what was said. </p>

<p>Under the <a href="../../../government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/data_protection.html">Data
Protection Acts,</a> you are entitled to have <a href="http://www.dataprotection.ie/viewdoc.asp?m=m&amp;fn=/documents/guidance/3gm1.htm">access
to information held about you including your personnel records</a>. You may
access personal data which contains an expression of opinion about you unless
the expression of opinion was given in confidence or on the understanding that
it would be treated as confidential. </p>

<p>The Data Protection Commissioner has held that, in these cases, there is a
high threshold of confidentiality to be met. Simply placing the word
‘confidential’ at the top of a page does not automatically render the data
confidential. As a general rule, any opinions on an individual supplied by a
supervisor or manager may not be restricted under this provision. </p>

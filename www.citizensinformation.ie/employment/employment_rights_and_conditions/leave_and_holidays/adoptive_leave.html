<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>Under the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0002/index.html">Adoptive
Leave Act 1995,</a> as amended by the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0025/index.html">Adoptive
Leave Act 2005</a> only the adoptive mother is entitled to avail of adoptive
leave from employment, except in the case where a male is the sole adopter. </p>

<p>Since 1 March 2007 you are entitled to 24 weeks' adoptive leave. You are
also entitled to take 16 weeks' additional unpaid adoptive leave after your
adoptive leave ends – see below. </p>

<h3>Pay during adoptive leave</h3>

<p>Your right to adoptive leave means that you have a right to a period of
leave from employment without pay. However, your contract of employment may
provide for payment during the period of leave. If you have enough PRSI
contributions you may qualify for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/social_welfare_payments_to_families_and_children/adoptive_benefit.html">Adoptive
Benefit</a> which is paid by the Department of Social Protection while you are
on adoptive leave. You will not get Adoptive Benefit for the full 24 weeks
unless your adoptive leave begins on the date of placement. </p>

<h3>Additional unpaid adoptive leave</h3>

<p>Since 1 March 2007 you are also entitled to take up to a further 16 weeks'
additional adoptive leave, but this period is not covered by Adoptive Benefit,
nor is your employer obliged, unless otherwise agreed, to make any payment
during this period. If you become ill you can ask your employer if you can
terminate your unpaid additional adoptive leave. If your employer agrees you
would then transfer onto <a shape="rect" href="sick_leave.html">sick leave</a>
and may receive <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html">Illness
Benefit</a> or sick pay. </p>

<h3>Paternity leave</h3>

<p>New parents (other than the mother of the child) can get 2 weeks’
statutory <a href="paternity_leave.html">paternity leave</a> from employment
or self-employment following the birth or adoption of a child on or after 1
September 2016.</p>

<h3>Before the adoption</h3>

<p>You are entitled to <span>paid time off work</span> to attend preparation
classes and pre-adoption meetings with social workers required during the
pre-adoption process. </p>

<h3>Public holidays and annual leave</h3>

<p>You are entitled to leave for any public holidays that occur during your
adoptive leave (including additional adoptive leave). The right of employees to
leave for public holidays is set down in <a shape="rect" href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/sec0021.html#zza20y1997s21">Section
21 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.</a></p>

<p>Time spent on adoptive leave (including additional adoptive leave) is
treated as though you have been in employment, and this time can be used to
accumulate <a shape="rect" href="annual_leave_public_holidays.html">annual
leave</a> and <a shape="rect" href="public_holidays_in_ireland.html">public
holiday</a> entitlement.</p>

<h3>Employment rights</h3>

<p>Under the adoptive leave legislation all employment rights (except
remuneration and superannuation benefits) associated with the employment, such
as annual leave and seniority, are protected during adoptive leave and
additional adoptive leave. </p>

<h3>Postponement of adoptive leave</h3>

<p>Since 30 January 2006 if the adopted child is hospitalised, the period of
leave or additional leave may be postponed, provided that the employer
agrees.</p>

<h3>Returning to work following adoptive leave</h3>

<p>The employee has the same rights to return to work as with <a shape="rect" href="maternity_leave.html">maternity leave</a>, and must also give <span>4
weeks' notice</span> of the intention to return. You are entitled to return to
the job you had immediately before the leave, unless this is not reasonably
practicable for the employer. Where this is the case, then your employer must
offer you a suitable and appropriate alternative. The terms and conditions of
the alternative and the capacity under which you are to be employed, <span>must
not be less favourable </span>than your job before going on leave. </p>

<p><strong>PRSI contributions:</strong> you will automatically be awarded <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_insurance_prsi/credited_social_insurance_contributions.html">PRSI
credits</a> while you are getting Adoptive Benefit. If you avail of unpaid
additional adoptive leave you must get your employer to complete an <a shape="rect" href="http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Forms/Documents/al_credits.pdf">application form
for adoptive leave 'credits' (pdf),</a> after you return to work. </p>

<p>You are protected against <a shape="rect" href="../../unemployment_and_redundancy/dismissal/unfair_dismissal.html">unfair
dismissal</a> for claiming your rights under adoptive leave legislation.</p>

<p>The rights in relation to return to work apply equally to a new employer
where the business has changed hands while the employee was on leave.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_rules">
<h2 class="topic base_rules_title" id="l1f4da">Rules</h2>

<p><strong>Notice:</strong> You must give 4 weeks’ notice to your employer of
your intention to take adoptive leave (for both foreign and domestic adoptions)
before the expected placement of the child. As soon as is reasonably
practicable you must give your employer the expected date of the placement. If
you intend to take the 16 weeks' additional adoptive leave you must provide
your employer with at least 4 weeks written notice. Both these notices can be
given at the same time.</p>

<p>It is important to comply with the notice requirements as failure to do so
may cause loss of rights.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic base_howtoapply">
<h2 class="topic base_howtoapply_title" id="ld1a9a">How to apply</h2>

<p>You must notify your employer in writing of your intention to avail of
adoptive leave. You must give 4 weeks’ notice and your letter to your
employer should clearly outline the date on which you intend to commence
adoptive leave. You must give your employer a certificate of placement within 4
weeks of the date of the placement. </p>

<p>If you need further information about adoptive leave you should contact the
Workplace Relations Commission's <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Workplace_Relations_Services/Info_Cust_Serv/">Information
and Customer Service</a>. You can read more information in the booklet, <a href="http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Publications_Forms/Guide_to_the_Adoptive_Leave_Acts.pdf">Your
Adoptive Leave Rights Explained (pdf)</a>.</p>

<p>Complaints, disputes and grievances relating to adoptive leave can be
referred within 6 months of the dispute or complaint occurring. You must use
the online complaint form available on <a href="https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/">workplacerelations.ie</a>).
The time limit may be extended for up to a further 6 months, but only where
there is a reasonable cause which prevented the complaint being brought within
the normal time limit.</p>

<p>You should apply to the Adoptive Benefit Section of the Department of Social
Protection 5 weeks before you intend to start adoptive leave.</p>

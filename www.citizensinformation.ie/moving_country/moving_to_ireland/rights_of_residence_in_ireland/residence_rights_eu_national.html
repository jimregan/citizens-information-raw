<h2 class="topic base_introduction_title" id="l0b797">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are a national of the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/eu-eea-countries">European Economic
Area (EEA)</a> or of Switzerland, you have the right to stay in Ireland, and
your family members have the right to stay here also. There are some limits to
this right, however.</p>

<p>You can stay in Ireland for up to 3 months without restriction. If you plan
to stay more than 3 months, you must either: </p>
<ul><li>Be engaged in economic activity (employed or self employed) or </li>
  <li>Have sufficient resources and sickness insurance to ensure that you do
    not become a burden on the social services of Ireland or </li>
  <li>Be enrolled as a student or vocational trainee or </li>
  <li>Be a family member of a EU citizen in one of the previous categories.
  </li>
</ul><p>When you come to Ireland you do not need to register with the local
immigration officer and you do not need a residence card to live here. If you
wish to have a record of your residence in Ireland you can register with your
embassy of your country in Ireland.</p>

<p><strong>UK citizens:</strong> People who are <a href="residence_rules_UK_citizens.html">citizens of the United Kingdom
(UK)</a> are entitled to live in Ireland without any conditions or
restrictions. </p>

<h3>Seeking employment in Ireland</h3>

<p>If you are an EEA national, you can stay in Ireland if you are unemployed
and <a shape="rect" href="/en/employment/migrant_workers/coming_from_eu_to_work.html">looking for
work</a>. You can transfer your unemployment benefit from your country of
origin and it will be paid to you in Ireland for up to 3 months (can be up to 6
months in some cases). After that period, you may qualify for <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html">Jobseeker's
Allowance</a> if you satisfy the conditions, which include an <a shape="rect" href="/en/social_welfare/irish_social_welfare_system/social_assistance_payments/residency_requirements_for_social_assistance_in_ireland.html">Habitual
Residence Condition</a>. </p>

<h3>Residence rights for your family</h3>

<p>If you are an EEA or Swiss national, your family, whatever their
nationality, also have the right to live with you in Ireland. Your
<em>qualifying family member</em> is defined as your spouse, civil partner,
children under 21 and other children who are dependent on you and their spouses
or civil partners, your parents and your spouse or civil partner's parents, if
they are also dependent on you. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2015/en/si/0548.html">European
Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2O15</a> transpose <a shape="rect" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:158:0077:0123:en:PDF">EU
Directive 2004/38/EC (pdf)</a> into Irish law. The Directive allows for a wider
definition of family members. </p>

<p>The wider definition of family member means that the host member state must
facilitate the entry and residence of other family members who do not have an
absolute right to move but who are dependent on you or whose health is such
that they require care by you. Member states must also facilitate the entry and
residence of a partner with whom you have a durable relationship. These other
dependants or partners who are not <em>qualifying family members</em> are
<em>permitted family members</em>. </p>

<p>You can find more information about <a shape="rect" href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/EU%20Treaty%20Rights">these EU
Treaty Rights on the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service website</a>.
The Immigrant Council of Ireland has published a <a href="http://immigrantcouncil.ie/files/rights/1b403-factsheet_4_family_members_of_eu_nationals.pdf">leaflet
on family reunification for family members of EU citizens (pdf).</a></p>

<p>If your family members are not nationals of the EEA, they will need to apply
for residence cards and may also need <a shape="rect" href="../coming_to_live_in_ireland/visa_requirements_for_entering_ireland.html">entry
visas.</a> There is no fee for the residence card. They will also need to <a shape="rect" href="registration_of_non_eea_nationals_in_ireland.html">register
with immigration</a> and receive an Immigration Certificate of Registration
(often called a GNIB card). As dependants of an EEA citizen, they will be
exempt from the fee for this certificate.</p>

<h3>Limitations on the right of residence</h3>

<p>You or a family member may be asked to leave the State if you act in such a
way as to be a danger to public order or security. Having a criminal record is
not, in itself, grounds to be asked to leave. You may also be asked to leave on
public health grounds. </p>

<p>You must be told reasons for the decision and given time to prepare an
appeal.</p>

<h3>Permanent residence</h3>

<p>These Regulations also introduce a new right of permanent residence for EEA
nationals and their family members after a five-year period of uninterrupted
legal residence in the State.</p>

<h3>Requirement to produce identity documents</h3>

<p>Section 34 of the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0023/index.html">Civil Law
(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011</a> provides that non-EEA nationals
arriving in the State must present a passport or equivalent document when asked
for it by an immigration officer. (Previously, it was not specifically stated
that they had to present it.)</p>

<p>It also requires non-EEA nationals who are present in the State to provide
such a document or a registration certificate on demand to the Minister, an
immigration officer or a Garda, if asked to do so to prove that they comply
with their permission to remain in the State. This requirement does not apply
to people under 16 years of age, but it does now apply to non-EEA nationals who
were born in Ireland.</p>

<p>Section 34 does not apply to people who are exercising <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/EU%20Treaty%20Rights">EU Treaty
Rights of free movement</a>. However, anyone seeking to enter or live in the
State on the basis of being an EEA national or a dependant of an EEA national
is still required to provide satisfactory evidence of identity and nationality
to establish that basis. </p>

<h3>Parents of Irish citizen children</h3>

<p>On 8 March 2011 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in the Zambrano
case <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&amp;Submit=rechercher&amp;numaff=C-34/09">C
34/09</a>, that an EU member state may not refuse the non-EEA parents of a
dependent child who is a citizen of, and resident in, an EU member state the
right to live and work in that member state. Non-EEA parents who meet the <a href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP16000113">Zambrano criteria</a>
may be given permission to live and work in Ireland without the requirement for
an employment permit or business permission.</p>

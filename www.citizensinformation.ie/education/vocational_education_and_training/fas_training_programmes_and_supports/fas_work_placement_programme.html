<p>The Work Placement Programme (WPP) provides 9 months’ work experience in
the private, public, community and voluntary sectors for graduates and other
unemployed people. The placements are for a minimum of 25 hours per week.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Since 21 October 2016, the Work Placement Programme is closed to new
applications.</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p>The programme is available to people getting most social welfare payments,
including Jobseeker's Allowance and Jobseeker's Benefit. If you are getting a
social welfare payment for at least 3 months, you may be able to keep it while
on the programme - see 'Keeping your social welfare payment' below. </p>

<p>People who are not getting a social welfare payment, or who are on a payment
for less than 3 months, are eligible to take part, but will not be get a social
welfare payment while on the programme. </p>

<p>There are 2 streams in the Work Placement Programme (WPP). Stream 1 offers
places for graduates and Stream 2 offers places for unemployed people, with a
number of these places reserved for those aged under 34. If you are an
unemployed graduate, you can apply for place in either stream. Placements are
allocated to a region according to the number of people on the Live Register in
that region and are allocated on a ‘first come, first served’ basis - see
‘How to apply’ below.</p>

<h3>Stream 1</h3>

<p>To be eligible for Stream 1 of the Work Placement Programme you must:</p>
<ul><li>Have been awarded a qualification at level 7 or higher on the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.nfq.ie/nfq/en/">National Framework of
    Qualifications</a>. </li>
  <li>Be unemployed. You do not have to be getting a social welfare payment.
  </li>
</ul><h3>Stream 2</h3>

<p>To be eligible for Stream 2 of the Work Placement Programme you must be
unemployed. You do not have to be getting a social welfare payment. </p>

<p>You do not have to be a graduate, but graduates can apply.</p>

<h3>Keeping your social welfare payment</h3>

<p>If you are getting a qualifying social welfare payment for at least 3
months, you may be able to keep your payment while on the Work Placement
Programme, subject to the approval of the Department of Social Protection
(DSP). You must notify the Department that you are starting a placement, as
this changes your status. Arrangements have been made to allow participants on
the Work Placement Programme to sign on by post if they are claiming
jobseeker's payments. As WPP is a voluntary work placement no payment from the
employer is permitted.</p>

<p>The qualifying payments are:</p>
<ul><li>Jobseeker’s Allowance </li>
  <li>Jobseeker’s Benefit </li>
  <li>Jobseeker's Transitional payment </li>
  <li>Disability Allowance </li>
  <li>Blind Pension </li>
  <li>Invalidity Pension </li>
  <li>Illness Benefit </li>
  <li>One-Parent Family Payment </li>
  <li>Deserted Wife's Benefit</li>
  <li>Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Pension</li>
  <li>Supplementary Welfare Allowance</li>
</ul><p>If you are getting Disability Allowance, Blind Pension, Invalidity Pension
or Illness Benefit you must apply to the Department of Social Protection for an
exemption to start a placement on the Work Placement Programme. </p>

<p>If you are on Illness Benefit you must be getting a social welfare payment
for 6 months before you can apply for the programme. </p>

<h3>Leaving a placement to take up a job</h3>

<p>If you get a job during the placement you are under no obligation to stay.
You should give the placement provider and the Department one week's notice
that you are leaving.</p>

<p>In addition, your provider may be able to employ you under the JobsPlus
incentive directly from your placement. You must have been getting a qualifying
payment prior to your placement and you must satisfy the required qualifying
period and conditions. You can read more in our document on <a href="jobsplus.html">JobsPlus</a>.</p>

<h3>Employers</h3>

<p>Employers in the public, private and voluntary sectors are all eligible to
participate in the Work Placement Programme. </p>

<p>The requirements for employers providing the work placements include:</p>
<ul><li>They must register with the DSP as a provider </li>
  <li>The maximum number of placements for each employer is 10 or 10% of the
    workforce, whichever is the lower </li>
  <li>The placement must be for a minimum of 25 hours </li>
  <li>The placement offered must not be in an area of work where there is an
    existing vacancy </li>
</ul><p>In general, employers will be able to participate if they had no
redundancies in the previous 3 months. However, employers who have made people
redundant in the last 3 months will still be able to participate if the number
of redundancies in that period is less than 5% of the workforce. </p>
